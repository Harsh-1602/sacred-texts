1	1	1	. The (rites) based on the spreading (of the three sacred fires) have been declared; we shall declare the Grihya (rites).
1	1	2	. There are three (kinds of) Pâkayagñas, the hutas, (i.e. the sacrifices) offered over the fire; over something that is not the fire, the prahutas; and at the feeding of Brâhmanas, those offered in the Brahman.
1	1	3	. And they quote also Rikas, 'He who with a piece of wood or with an oblation, or with knowledge ("veda").'
1	1	4	. Even he who only puts a piece of wood (on the fire) full of belief, should think, 'Here I offer a sacrifice; adoration to that (deity)!'(The Rik quoted above then says), 'He who with an oblation'—and, 'He who with knowledge;' even by learning only satisfaction is produced (in the gods).Seeing this the Rishi has said, 'To him who does not keep away from himself the cows, to him who longs for cows, who dwells in the sky, speak a wonderful word, sweeter than ghee and honey.' Thereby he means, 'This my word, sweeter than ghee and honey, is satisfaction (to the god); may it be sweeter.'(And another Rishi says), 'To thee, O Agni, by this Rik we offer an oblation prepared by our heart; may these be oxen, bulls, and cows.' (Thereby he means), 'They are my oxen, bulls, and cows (which I offer to the god), they who study this text, reciting it for themselves (as their Svâdhyâya).'(And further on the Rik quoted above says), 'He who (worships Agni) with adoration, offering rich sacrifices.' 'Verily also by the performing of adoration (the gods may be worshipped); for the gods are not beyond the performing of adoration; adoration verily is sacrifice'—thus runs a Brâhmana.
1	2	1	. Now he should make oblations in the evening and in the morning of prepared sacrificial food,
1	2	2	. To the deities of the Agnihotra, to Soma Vanaspati, to Agni and Soma, to Indra and Agni, to Heaven and Earth, to Dhanvantari, to Indra, to the Visve devâs, to Brahman.
1	2	3	. He says Svâhâ, and then he offers the Balis—
1	2	4	To those same deities, to the waters, to the herbs and trees, to the house, to the domestic deities, to the deities of the ground (on which the house stands),
1	2	5	. To Indra and Indra's men, to Yama and Yama's men, to Varuna and Varuna's men, to Soma and Soma's men—these (oblations he makes) to the different quarters (of the horizon, of which those are the presiding deities).
1	2	6	To Brahman and Brahman's men in the middle,
1	2	7	To the Visve devâs, to all day-walking beings—thus by day;
1	2	8	To the night-walking (beings)—thus at night.
1	2	9	To the Rakshas—thus to the north.
1	2	10	Svadhâ to the fathers (i.e. Manes)'—with these words he should pour out the remnants to the south, with the sacrificial cord suspended over the right shoulder.
1	3	1	. Now wherever he intends to perform a sacrifice, let him besmear (with cowdung) a surface of the dimension at least of an arrow on each side; let him draw six lines thereon, one turned to the north, to the west (of the spot on which the fire is to be placed); two (lines) turned to the east, at the two different ends (of the line mentioned first); three (lines) in the middle (of those two); let him sprinkle that (place with water), establish the (sacred) fire (thereon), put (two or three pieces of fuel) on it, wipe (the ground) round (the fire), strew (grass) round (it), to the east, to the south, to the west, to the north, ending (each time) in the north. Then (follows) silently the sprinkling (of water) round (the fire).
1	3	2	With two (Kusa blades used as) strainers the purifying of the Âgya (is done).
1	3	3	. Having taken two Kusa blades with unbroken tops, which do not bear a young shoot in them, of the measure of a span, at their two ends with histhumbs and fourth fingers, with his hands turned with the inside upwards, he purifies (the Âgya, from the west) to the east, with (the words), 'By the impulse of Savitri I purify thee with this uninjured purifier, with the rays of the good sun'—once with this formula, twice silently.
1	3	4	. The strewing (of grass) round (the fire) may be done or not done in the Âgya offerings.
1	3	5	. So also the two Âgya portions (may optionally be sacrificed) in the Pâkayagñas.
1	3	6	. And the (assistance of a) Brahman (is optional), except at the sacrifice to Dhanvantari and at the sacrifice of the spit-ox (offered to Rudra).
1	3	7	. Let him sacrifice with (the words), 'To such and such a deity svâhâ!'
1	3	8	If there is no rule (as to the deities to whom the sacrifice belongs, they are) Agni, Indra, Pragâpati, the Visve devâs, Brahman.
1	3	9	. (Different Pâkayagñas, when) offered at the same time, should have the same Barhis (sacrificial grass), the same fuel, the same Âgya, and the same (oblation to Agni) Svishtakrit.
1	3	10	With reference thereto the following sacrificial stanza is sung:'He who has to perform (different) Pâkayagñas, should offer them with the same Âgya, the same[paragraph continues] Barhis, and the same Svishtakrit, even if the deity (of those sacrifices) is not the same.'
1	4	1	. During the northern course of the sun, in the time of the increasing moon, under an auspicious Nakshatra the tonsure (of the child's head), the initiation (of a Brahmakârin), the cutting of the beard, and marriage (should be celebrated).
1	4	2	According to some (teachers), marriage (may be celebrated) at any time.
1	4	3	Before those (ceremonies) let him sacrifice four Âgya oblations—
1	4	4	With the three (verses), 'Agni, thou purifiest life' , and with (the one verse), 'Pragâpati, no other one than thou' .
1	4	5	. Or with the Vyâhritis.
1	4	6	. According to some (teachers), the one and the other.
1	4	7	. No such(oblations), according to some (teachers).
1	4	8	At the marriage the fourth oblation with the verse, 'Thou (O Agni) art Aryaman towards the girls' .
1	5	1	. Let him first examine the family (of the intended bride or bridegroom), as it has been said above,[paragraph continues] 'Those who on the mother's and on the father's side.'
1	5	2	Let him give the girl to a (young man) endowed with intelligence.
1	5	3	Let him marry a girl that shows the characteristics of intelligence, beauty, and moral conduct, and who is free from disease.
1	5	4	. As the characteristics (mentioned in the preceding Sûtra) are difficult to discern, let him make eight lumps (of earth), recite over the lumps the following formula, 'Right has been born first, in the beginning; on the right truth is founded. For what (destiny) this girl is born, that may she attain here. What is true may that be seen,' and let him say to the girl, 'Take one of these.'
1	5	5	. If she chooses the (lump of earth taken) from a field that yields two crops (in one year), he may know, 'Her offspring will be rich in food.' If from a cow-stable, rich in cattle. If from the earth of a Vedi (altar), rich in holy lustre. If from a pool which does not dry up, rich in everything. If from a gambling-place, addicted to gambling. If from a place where four roads meet, wandering to different directions. If from a barren spot, poor. If from a burial-ground, (she will) bring death to her husband.
1	6	1	. (The father) may give away the girl, having decked her with ornaments, pouring out a libation of water: this is the wedding (called) Brâhma. A son born by her (after a wedding of this kind) brings purification to twelve descendants and to twelve ancestors on both (the husband's and the wife's) sides.
1	6	2	. He may give her, having decked her with ornaments, to an officiating priest, whilst a sacrifice with the three (Srauta) fires is going on: this (is the wedding called) Daiva. (A son) brings purification to ten descendants and to ten ancestors on both sides.
1	6	3	. They fulfil the law together: this (is the wedding called) Prâgâpatya. (A son) brings purification to eight descendants and to eight ancestors on both sides.
1	6	4	. He may marry her after having given a bull and a cow (to the girl's father): this (is the wedding called) Ârsha. (A son) brings purification to seven descendants and to seven ancestors on both sides.
1	6	5	. He may marry her, after a mutual agreement has been made (between the lover and the damsel): this (is the wedding called) Gândharva.
1	6	6	. He may marry her after gladdening (her father) by money: this (is the wedding called) Âsura.
1	6	7	. He may carry her off while (her relatives) sleep or pay no attention: this (is the wedding called) Paisâka.
1	6	8	. He may carry her off, killing (her relatives) and cleaving (their) heads, while she weeps and they weep: this (is the wedding called) Râkshasa.
1	7	1	Now various indeed are the customs of the (different) countries and the customs of the (different) villages: those one should observe at the wedding.
1	7	2	What, however, is commonly accepted, that we shall state.
1	7	3	. Having placed to the west of the fire a mill-stone, to the north-east (of the fire) a water-pot, he should sacrifice, while she takes hold of him. Standing, with his face turned to the west, while she is sitting and turns her face to the east, he should with (the formula), 'I seize thy hand for the sake of happiness seize her thumb if he desires that only male children may be born to him;
1	7	4	Her other fingers, (if he is) desirous of female (children);
1	7	5	The hand on the hair-side together with thethumb, (if) desirous of both (male and female children).
1	7	6	. Leading her three times round the fire and the water-pot, so that their right sides are turned towards (the fire, &c.), he murmurs, 'This am I, that art thou; that art thou, this am I; the heaven I, the earth thou; the Sâman I, the Rik thou. Come! Let us here marry. Let us beget offspring. Loving, bright, with genial mind may we live a hundred autumns.'
1	7	7	. Each time after he has lead her (so) round, he makes her tread on the stone with (the words), 'Tread on this stone; like a stone be firm. Overcome the enemies; tread the foes down.'
1	7	8	. Having 'spread under' (i.e. having first poured Âgya over her hands), her brother or a person acting in her brother's place pours fried grain twice over the wife's joined hands.
1	7	9	. Three times for descendants of Gamadagni.
1	7	10	He pours again (Âgya) over (what has been left of) the sacrificial food,
1	7	11	And over what has been cut off.
1	7	12	This is the rule about the portions to be cut off.
1	7	13	. 'To god Aryaman the girls have made sacrifice,to Agni; may he, god Aryaman, loosen her from this, and not from that place, Svâhâ!'To god Varuna the girls have made sacrifice, to Agni; may he, god Varuna, &c.'To god Pûshan the girls have made sacrifice, to Agni; may he, god Pûshan, &c.'—with (these verses recited by the bridegroom) she should sacrifice (the fried grain) without opening her joined hands, as if (she did so) with the (spoon called) Sruk.
1	7	14	. Without that leading round (the fire, she sacrifices grain) with the neb of a basket towards herself silently a fourth time.
1	7	15	Some lead the bride round each time after the fried grain has been poured out: thus the two last oblations do not follow immediately on each other.
1	7	16	He then loosens her two locks of hair, if they are made, (i.e. if) two tufts of wool are bound round her hair on the two sides,
1	7	17	With (the Rik),'I release thee from the band of Varuna' .
1	7	18	The left one with the following (Rik).
1	7	19	. He then causes her to step forward in a northeastern direction seven steps with (the words), 'For sap with one step, for juice with two steps, for thriving of wealth with three steps, for comfort with four steps, for offspring with five steps, for the seasonswith six steps. Be friend with seven steps. So be thou devoted to me. Let us acquire many sons who may reach old age!'
1	7	20	. Joining together their two heads, (the bridegroom? the Âkârya?) sprinkles them (with water) from the water-pot.
1	7	21	And she should dwell that night in the house of an old Brâhmana woman whose husband is alive and whose children are alive.
1	7	22	. When she sees the polar-star, the star Arundhatî, and the seven Rishis (ursa major), let her break the silence (and say), 'May my husband live and I get offspring.'
1	8	1	. If (the newly-married couple) have to make a journey (to their new home), let him cause her to mount the chariot with the (verse), 'May Pûshan lead thee from here holding thy hand' .
1	8	2	. With the hemistich, 'Carrying stones (the river) streams; hold fast each other'  let him cause her to ascend a ship.
1	8	3	With the following (hemistich) let him make her descend (from it).
1	8	4	. (He pronounces the verse), 'The living one they bewail' , if she weeps.
1	8	5	They constantly carry the nuptial fire in front.
1	8	6	. At lovely places, trees, and cross-ways let him murmur (the verse), 'May no waylayers meet us' .
1	8	7	At every dwelling-place (on their way) let him look at the lookers on, with (the verse), 'Good luck brings this woman' .
1	8	8	. With (the verse), 'Here may delight fulfil itself to thee through offspring'  he should make her enter the house.
1	8	9	. Having given its place to the nuptial fire, and having spread to the west of it a bull's hide with the neck to the east, with the hair outside, he makes oblations, while she is sitting on that (hide) and takes hold of him, with the four (verses), 'May Pragâpati create offspring to us' , verse by verse, and with (the verse), 'May all the gods unite' , he partakes of curds and gives (thereof) to her, or he besmears their two hearts with the rest of the Âgya (of which he has sacrificed).
1	8	10	From that time they should eat no saline food, they should be chaste, wear ornaments, sleep on the ground three nights or twelve nights;
1	8	11	Or one year, (according to) some (teachers); thus, they say, a Rishi will be born (as their son).
1	8	12	. When he has fulfilled (this) observance (and has had intercourse with his wife), he should give the bride's shift to (the Brâhmana) who knows the Sûryâ hymn ;
1	8	13	'Food to the Brâhmanas;
1	8	14	Then he should cause them to pronounce auspicious words.
1	9	1	. Beginning from the seizing of (the bride's) hand (i.e. from the wedding), he should worship the domestic (fire) himself, or his wife, or also his son, or his daughter, or a pupil.
1	9	2	(The fire) should be kept constantly.
1	9	3	When it goes out, however, the wife should fast: thus (say) some (teachers).
1	9	4	. The time for setting it in a blaze and for sacrificing in it has been explained by (the rules given with regard to) the Agnihotra,
1	9	5	. And the sacrificial food, except meat.
1	9	6	But if he likes he may (perform the sacrifice) with rice, barley, or sesamum.
1	9	7	He should sacrifice in the evening with (the formula), 'To Agni svâhâ!' in the morning with (the formula), 'To Sûrya svâhâ!' Silently the second (oblations) both times.
1	10	1	Now the oblations of cooked food on the (two) Parvan (i.e. the new and full moon) days.
1	10	2	The fasting (which takes place) thereat has been declared by (the corresponding rules regarding) the Darsapûrnamâsa sacrifices.
1	10	3	. And (so has been declared) the binding together of the fuel and of the Barhis,
1	10	4	. And the deities (to whom those oblations belong), with the exception of the Upâmsuyâga (offerings at which the formulas are repeated with low voice), and of Indra and Mahendra.
1	10	5	Other deities (may be worshipped) according to the wishes (which the sacrificer connects with his offerings).
1	10	6	For each single deity he pours out four handsful (of rice, barley, &c.), placing two purifiers (i.e. Kusa blades, on the vessel), with (the formula), 'Agreeable to such and such (a deity) I pour thee out.'
1	10	7	He then sprinkles them (those four portions of Havis with water) in the same way as he had poured them out, with (the formula), 'Agreeable to such and such (a deity) I sprinkle thee.'
1	10	8	When (the rice or barley grains) have been husked and cleansed from the husks three times, let him cook (the four portions) separately,
1	10	9	Or throwing (them) together.
1	10	10	If he cooks them separately, let him touch the grains, after he has separated them, (and say,) 'This to this god; this to this god.'
1	10	11	But if he (cooks the portions) throwing (them) together, he should (touch and) sacrifice them, after he has put (the single portions) into different vessels.
1	10	12	. The portions of sacrificial food, when theyhave been cooked, he sprinkles , he should sacrifice the two Âgya portions with (the formulas), 'To Agni svâhâ! To Soma svâhâ!'—
1	10	14	. The northern one belonging to Agni, the southern one to Soma.
1	10	15	. It is understood (in the Sruti), The two eyes indeed of the sacrifice are the Âgya portions,
1	10	16	. 'Therefore of a man who is sitting with his face to the west the southern (i.e. right) eye is northern, the northern (i.e. left) eye is southern.'
1	10	17	. In the middle (of the two Âgya portions hesacrifices the other) Havis, or more to the west, finishing (the oblations) in the east or in the north.
1	10	18	To the north-east the oblation to (Agni) Svishtakrit.
1	10	19	. He cuts off (the Avadâna portions) from the Havis from the middle and from the eastern part;
1	10	20	From the middle, the eastern part and the western part (the portions have to be cut off) by those who make five Avadânas;
1	10	21	From the northern side the portion for Svishtakrit.
1	10	22	. Here he omits the second pouring (of Âgya) over (what is left of) the sacrificial food.
1	10	23	. 'What I have done too much in this ceremony, or what I have done here too little, all that may Agni Svishtakrit, he who knows it, make well sacrificed and well offered for me. To Agni Svishtakrit, to him who offers the oblations for general expiation, so that they are well offered, to him who makes us succeed in what we desire! Make us in all that we desire successful! Svâhâ!'
1	10	24	. He pours out the full vessel on the Barhis.
1	10	25	. This is the Avabhritha.
1	10	26	This is the standard form of the Pâkayagñas.
1	10	27	What has been left of the Havis is the fee for the sacrifice.
1	11	1	Now (follows) the ritual of the animal sacrifice.
1	11	2	. Having prepared to the north of the fire the place for the Sâmitra fire, having given drink (to the animal which he is going to sacrifice), having washed the animal, having placed it to the east (of the fire) with its face to the west, having made oblations with the two Rikas, 'Agni as our messenger' , let him touch (the animal) from behind with a fresh branch on which there are leaves, with (the formula), 'Agreeable to such and such (a deity) I touch thee.'
1	11	3	He sprinkles it from before with water in which rice and barley are, with (the formula), 'Agreeable to such and such (a deity) I sprinkle thee.'
1	11	4	Having given (to the animal) to drink of that (water), he should pour out the rest (of it) along its right fore-foot.
1	11	5	Having carried fire round (it), performing that act only (without repeating a corresponding Mantra), they lead it to the north.
1	11	6	. In front of it they carry a fire-brand.
1	11	7	This is the Sâmitra (fire).
1	11	8	. With the two Vapâsrapanî ladles the 'performer' touches the animal.
1	11	9	The sacrificer (touches) the performer.
1	11	10	. To the west of the Sâmitra (fire) he (the Samitri) kills (the animal), the head of which is turned to the east or to the west, the feet to the north; and having placed a grass-blade on his side of the (animal's) navel, (the 'performer') draws out the omentum, cuts off the omentum, seizes it with the two Agnisrapanîs, sprinkles it with water, warms it at the Sâmitra (fire), takes it before that fire, roasts it, being seated to the south, goes round (the two fires), and sacrifices it.
1	11	11	. At the same fire they cook a mess of food.
1	11	12	. Having cut off the eleven Avadânas (or portions which have to be cut off) from the animal, from all its limbs, having boiled them at the Sâmitra (fire),and having warmed the heart on a spit, let him sacrifice first from the mess of cooked food ;
1	11	13	Or together with the Avadâna portions.
1	11	14	. From each of the (eleven) Avadânas he cuts off two portions.
1	11	15	. They perform the rites only (without corresponding Mantras) with the heart's spit .
1	12	1	. At a Kaitya sacrifice he should before the Svishtakrit (offering) offer a Bali to the Kaitya.
1	12	2	. If, however, (the Kaitya) is distant, (he should send his Bali) through a leaf-messenger.
1	12	3	. With the Rik, 'Where thou knowest, O tree' , let him make two lumps (of food), put them on a carrying-pole, hand them over to the messenger, and say to him, 'Carry this Bali to that (Kaitya).'
1	12	4	(He gives him the lump) which is destined for the messenger, with (the words), 'This to thee.'
1	12	5	If there is anything dangerous between (them and the Kaitya), (he gives him) some weapon also.
1	12	6	. If a navigable river is between (them and the Kaitya, he gives him) also something like a raft with (the words), 'Hereby thou shalt cross.'
1	12	7	. At the Dhanvantari sacrifice let him offer first a Bali to the Purohita, between the Brahman and the fire.
1	13	1	. The Upanishad (treats of) the Garbhalambhana, the Pumsavana, and the Anavalobhana (i.e. the ceremonies for securing the conception of a child, the male gender of the child, and for preventing disturbances which could endanger the embryo).
1	13	2	. If he does not study (that Upanishad), heshould in the third month of her pregnancy, under (the Nakshatra) Tishya, give to eat (to the wife), after she has fasted, in curds from a cow which has a calf of the same colour (with herself), two beans and one barley grain for each handful of curds.
1	13	3	To his question, 'What dost thou drink? What dost thou drink?' she should thrice reply, 'Generation of a male child! Generation of a male child!'
1	13	4	Thus three handfuls (of curds).
1	13	5	. He then inserts into her right nostril, in the shadow of a round apartment, (the sap of) an herb which is not faded,
1	13	6	. According to some (teachers) with the Pragâvat and Gîvaputra hymns.
1	13	7	Having sacrificed of a mess of cooked food sacred to Pragâpati, he should touch the place of her heart with the (verse,) 'What is hidden, O thou whose hair is well parted, in thy heart, in Pragâpati, that I know; such is my belief. May I not fall into distress that comes from sons.'
1	14	1	In the fourth month of pregnancy the Sîmantonnayana (or parting of the hair, is performed).
1	14	2	In the fortnight of the increasing moon, when the moon stands in conjunction with a Nakshatra (that has a name) of masculine gender—
1	14	3	. Then he gives its place to the fire, and having spread to the west of it a bull's hide with the neck to the east, with the hair outside, (he makes oblations,) while (his wife) is sitting on that (hide) and takes hold of him, with the two (verses), 'May Dhâtri give to his worshipper,' with the two verses, 'I invoke Râkâ' , and with (the texts), 'Negamesha,' and, 'Pragâpati, no other one than thou' .
1	14	4	He then three times parts her hair upwards (i.e. beginning from the front) with a bunch containing an even number of unripe fruits, and with a porcupine's quill that has three white spots, and with three bunches of Kusa grass, with (the words), 'Bhûr bhuvah, svar, om!'
1	14	5	Or four times.
1	14	6	He gives orders to two lute-players, 'Sing king Soma.'
1	14	7	. (They sing) 'May Soma our king bless the human race. Settled is the wheel of N.N.'—(here they name) the river near which they dwell.
1	14	8	And whatever aged Brâhmana woman, whose husbands and children are alive, tell them, that let them do.
1	14	9	A bull is the fee for the sacrifice.
1	15	1	. When a son has been born, (the father) should, before other people touch him, give him to eat from gold (i.e. from a golden vessel or with a golden spoon) butter and honey with which he has ground gold(-dust), with (the verse), 'I administer to thee the wisdom ('veda') of honey, of ghee, raised by Savitri the bountiful. Long-living, protected by the gods, live a hundred autumns in this world!'
1	15	2	Approaching (his mouth) to (the child's) two ears he murmurs the 'production of intelligence:' 'Intelligence may give to thee god Savitri, intelligence may goddess Sarasvatî, intelligence may give to thee the two divine Asvins, wreathed with lotus.'
1	15	3	. He touches (the child's) two shoulders with (the verse), 'Be a stone, be an axe, be insuperable gold. Thou indeed art the Veda, called son; so live a hundred autumns'—and with (the verses), 'Indra, give the best treasures' , Bestow on us, O bountiful one, O speedy one' .
1	15	4	And let them give him a name beginning witha sonant, with a semivowel in it, with the Visarga at its end, consisting of two syllables,
1	15	5	Or of four syllables;
1	15	6	Of two syllables, if he is desirous of firm position; of four syllables, if he is desirous of holy lustre;
1	15	7	But in every case with an even number (of syllables) for men, an uneven for women.
1	15	8	And let him also find out (for the child) a name to be used at respectful salutations (such as that due to the Âkârya at the ceremony of the initiation); that his mother and his father (alone) should know till his initiation.
1	15	9	When he returns from a journey, he embraces his son's head and murmurs, 'From limb by limb thou art produced; out of the heart thou art born. Thou indeed art the self called son; so live a hundred autumns!'—(thus) he kisses him three times on his head.
1	15	10	The rite only (without the Mantra is performed) for a girl.
1	16	1	. In the sixth month the Annaprâsana (i.e. the first feeding with solid food).
1	16	2	Goat's flesh, if he is desirous of nourishment,
1	16	3	Flesh of partridge, if desirous of holy lustre,
1	16	4	Boiled rice with ghee, if desirous of splendour:
1	16	5	(Such) food, mixed with curds, honey and ghee he should give (to the child) to eat with (the verse), 'Lord of food, give us food painless and strong;bring forward the giver; bestow power on us, on men and animals.'
1	16	6	The rite only (without the Mantra) for a girl.
1	17	1	In the third year the Kaula (i.e. the tonsure of the child's head), or according to the custom of the family.
1	17	2	To the north of the fire he places vessels which are filled respectively, with rice, barley, beans, and sesamum seeds;
1	17	3	To the west (the boy) for whom the ceremony shall be performed, in his mother's lap, bull-dung in a new vessel, and Samî leaves are placed.
1	17	4	. To the south of the mother the father (is seated) holding twenty-one bunches of Kusa grass.
1	17	5	Or the Brahman should hold them.
1	17	6	To the west of (the boy) for whom the ceremony is to be performed, (the father) stations himself and pours cold and warm water together with (the words), 'With warm water, O Vâyu, come hither!'
1	17	7	Taking of that (water), (and) fresh butter, or (some) drops of curds, he three times moistens (the boy's) head, from the left to the right, with (the formula), 'May Aditi cut thy hair; may the waters moisten thee for vigour!'
1	17	8	. Into the right part (of the hair) he puts eachtime three Kusa bunches, with the points towards (the boy) himself, with (the words), 'Herb! protect him!'
1	17	9	(With the words,) 'Axe! do no harm to him!' he presses a copper razor (on the Kusa blades),
1	17	10	And cuts (the hair) with (the verse), 'The razor with which in the beginning Savitri the knowing one has shaved (the beard) of king Soma and of Varuna, with that, ye Brâhmanas, shave now his (hair), that he may be blessed with long life, with old age.'
1	17	11	Each time that he has cut, he gives (the hairs) with their points to the east, together with Samî leaves, to the mother. She puts them down on the bull-dung.
1	17	12	'With what Dhâtri has shaven (the head) of Brihaspati, Agni and Indra, for the sake of long life, with that I shave thy (head) for the sake of long life, of glory, and of welfare'—thus a second time.
1	17	13	. 'By what he may at night further see the sun, and see it long, with that I shave thy (head) for the sake of long life, of glory, and of welfare'—thus a third time.
1	17	14	With all (the indicated) Mantras a fourth time.
1	17	15	Thus three times on the left side (of the head).
1	17	16	. Let him wipe off the edge of the razor with (the words), 'If thou shavest, as a shaver, his hair with the razor, the wounding, the well-shaped, purify his head, but do not take away his life.'
1	17	17	Let him give orders to the barber, 'With lukewarm water doing what has to be done with water, without doing harm to him, arrange (his hair) well.'
1	17	18	. Let him have the arrangement of the hair made according to the custom of his family.
1	17	19	The rite only (without the Mantras) for a girl.
1	18	1	Thereby the Godânakarman (i.e. the ceremony of shaving the beard, is declared).
1	18	2	In the sixteenth year.
1	18	3	Instead of the word 'hair' he should (each time that it occurs in the Mantras) put the word 'beard.'
1	18	4	. Here they moisten the beard.
1	18	5	. (The Mantra is), 'Purify his head and his face, but do not take away his life.'
1	18	6	. He gives orders (to the barber with the words), 'Arrange his hair, his beard, the hair of his body, and his nails, ending in the north.'
1	18	7	. Having bathed and silently stood during the rest of the day, let him break his silence in the presence of his teacher, (saying to him,) 'I give an optional gift (to thee).'
1	18	8	An ox and a cow is the sacrificial fee.
1	18	9	. Let (the teacher) impose (on the youth the observances declared below) for one year.
1	19	1	In the eighth year let him initiate a Brâhmana,
1	19	2	Or in the eighth year after the conception;
1	19	3	In the eleventh a Kshatriya;
1	19	4	In the twelfth a Vaisya.
1	19	5	Until the sixteenth (year) the time has not passed for a Brâhmana;
1	19	6	Until the twenty-second for a Kshatriya;
1	19	7	Until the twenty-fourth for a Vaisya.
1	19	8	After that (time has passed), they become patitasâvitrîka (i.e. they have lost their right of learning the Sâvitrî).
1	19	9	No one should initiate such men, nor teach them, nor perform sacrifices for them, nor have intercourse with them.
1	19	10	. (Let him initiate) the youth who is adorned and whose (hair on the) head is arranged, who wears a (new) garment that has not yet been washed, or an antelope-skin, if he is a Brâhmana, the skin of a spotted deer, if a Kshatriya, a goat's skin, if a Vaisya.
1	19	11	If they put on garments, they should put on dyed (garments): the Brâhmana a reddish yellow one, the Kshatriya a light red one, the Vaisya a yellow one.
1	19	12	Their girdles are: that of a Brâhmana made of Muñga grass, that of a Kshatriya a bow-string, that of a Vaisya woollen.
1	19	13	Their staffs are: that of a Brâhmana of Palâsa wood, that of a Kshatriya of Udumbara wood, that of a Vaisya of Bilva wood.
1	20	1	Or all (sorts of staffs are to be used) by (men of) all (castes).
1	20	2	. While (the student) takes hold of him, the teacher sacrifices and then stations himself to the north of the fire, with his face turned to the east.
1	20	3	To the east (of the fire) with his face to the west the other one.
1	20	4	(The teacher then) fills the two hollows of (his own and the student's) joined hands with water, and with the verse, 'That we choose of Savitri'  he makes with the full (hollow of his own hands the water) flow down on the full (hollow of) his, (i.e. the student's hands.) Having (thus) poured (the water over his hands) he should with his (own) hand seize his (i.e. the student's) hand together with the thumb, with (the formula), 'By the impulse of the god Savitri, with the arms of the two Asvins, with Pûshan's hands I seize thy hand, N.N.!'
1	20	5	With (the words), 'Savitri has seized thy hand, N.N.!' a second time.
1	20	6	With (the words), 'Agni is thy teacher, N.N.!' a third time.
1	20	7	He should cause him to look at the sun while the teacher says, 'God Savitri, this is thy Brahmakârin; protect him; may he not die.'
1	20	8	(And further the teacher says), 'Whose Brahmakârin art thou? The breath's Brahmakârin art thou. Who does initiate thee, and whom (does he initiate)? To whom shall I give thee in charge?'
1	20	9	With the half verse, 'A youth, well attired, dressed came hither'  he should cause him to turn round from the left to the right.
1	20	10	Reaching with his two hands over his (i.e. the student's) shoulders (the teacher) should touch the place of his heart with the following (half verse).
1	20	11	. Having wiped the ground round the fire, the student should put on a piece of wood silently. 'Silence indeed is what belongs to Pragâpati. The student becomes belonging to Pragâpati'—this is understood (in the Sruti).
1	21	1	Some (do this) with a Mantra: 'To Agni I have brought a piece of wood, to the great Gâtavedas. Through that piece of wood increase thou, O Agni; through the Brahman (may) we (increase). Svâhâ!'
1	21	2	Having put the fuel (on the fire) and havingtouched the fire, he three times wipes off his face with (the words), 'With splendour I anoint myself.'
1	21	3	'For with splendour does he anoint himself'—this is understood (in the Sruti).
1	21	4	'On me may Agni bestow insight, on me offspring, on me splendour.'On me may Indra bestow insight, on me offspring, on me strength (indriya).'On me may Sûrya bestow insight, on me offspring, on me radiance.'What thy splendour is, Agni, may I thereby become resplendent.'What thy vigour is, Agni, may I thereby become vigorous.'What thy consuming power is, Agni, may I thereby obtain consuming power'—with (these formulas) he should approach the fire, bend his knee, embrace (the teacher's feet), and say to him, 'Recite, sir! The Sâvitrî, sir, recite!'
1	21	5	Seizing with his (i.e. the student's) garment and with (his own) hands (the student's) hands (the teacher) recites the Sâvitrî, (firstly) Pâda by Pâda, (then) hemistich by hemistich, (and finally) the whole (verse).
1	21	6	He should make him recite (the Sâvitrî) as far as he is able.
1	21	7	On the place of his (i.e. the student's) heart (the teacher) lays his hand with the fingers upwards, with (the formula), 'Into my will I take thy heart; after my mind shall thy mind follow; in my word thou shalt rejoice with all thy will; may Brihaspati join thee to me.'
1	22	1	Having tied the girdle round him and given him the staff, he should impose the (observances of the) Brahmakarya on him—
1	22	2	(With the words), 'A Brahmakârin thou art. Eat water. Do the service. Do not sleep in the day-time. Devoted to the teacher study the Veda.'
1	22	3	Twelve years lasts the Brahmakarya for (each) Veda, or until he has learnt it.
1	22	4	Let him beg (food) in the evening and in the morning.
1	22	5	Let him put fuel on (the fire) in the evening and in the morning.
1	22	6	Let him beg first of a man who will not refuse,
1	22	7	Or of a woman who will not refuse.
1	22	8	(In begging he should use the words), 'Sir, give food!'
1	22	9	. Or, '(Sir, give) Anupravakanîya (food).'
1	22	10	. That (which he has received) he should announce to his teacher.
1	22	11	He should stand the rest of the day.
1	22	12	. After sunset (the student) should cook the Brâhmaudana (or boiled rice with which the Brâhmanas are to be fed) for the Anupravakanîya sacrifice (the sacrifice to be performed after a part of the Veda has been studied), and should announce to the teacher (that it is ready).
1	22	13	The teacher should sacrifice, while the student takes hold of him, with the verse, 'The wonderful lord of the abode' .
1	22	14	A second time with the Sâvitrî—
1	22	15	. And whatever else has been studied afterwards.
1	22	16	A third time to the Rishis.
1	22	17	A fourth time (the oblation) to (Agni) Svishtakrit.
1	22	18	. Having given food to the Brâhmanas he should cause them to pronounce the end of the Veda (study).
1	22	19	From that time (the student) should eat no saline food; he should observe chastity, and should sleep on the ground through three nights, or twelve nights, or one year.
1	22	20	. When he has fulfilled those observances, (the teacher) performs (for him) the 'production of intelligence,' (in the following way):
1	22	21	. While (the student) towards an unobjectionable direction (of the horizon) sprinkles thrice (water) from the left to the right with a water-pot round a[paragraph continues] Palâsa (tree) with one root, or round a Kusa bunch, if there is no Palâsa, (the teacher) causes him to say, 'O glorious one, thou art glorious. As thou, O glorious one, art glorious, thus, O glorious one, lead me to glory. As thou art the preserver of the treasure of sacrifice for the gods, thus may I become the preserver of the treasure of the Veda for men.'
1	22	22	. Thereby, beginning with his having the hair cut, and ending with the giving in charge, the imposing of observances has been declared.
1	22	23	Thus for one who has not been initiated before.
1	22	24	Now as regards one who has been initiated before:
1	22	25	. The cutting of the hair is optional,
1	22	26	. And the 'production of intelligence.'
1	22	27	. On the giving in charge there are no express rules (in this case);
1	22	28	. And on the time.
1	22	29	. (He should recite to him) as the Sâvitrî (the Rik),'That we choose of god Savitri' .
1	23	1	. He chooses priests (for officiating at a sacrifice) with neither deficient nor superfluous limbs, 'who onthe mother's and on the father's side (&c.),' as it has been said above.
1	23	2	Let him choose young men as officiating priests: thus (declare) some (teachers).
1	23	3	He chooses first the Brahman, then the Hotri, then the Adhvaryu, then the Udgâtri.
1	23	4	. Or all who officiate at the Ahîna sacrifices and at those lasting one day.
1	23	5	. The Kaushîtakinas prescribe the Sadasya as the seventeenth, saying, 'He is the looker-on at the performances.'
1	23	6	. This has been said in the two Rikas, 'He whom the officiating priests, performing (the sacrifice) in many ways' .
1	23	7	. He chooses the Hotri first.
1	23	8	With (the formula), 'Agni is my Hotri; he is my Hotri; I choose thee N.N. as my Hotri' (he chooses) the Hotri.
1	23	9	With (the formula), 'Kandramas (the moon) is my Brahman; he is my Brahman; I choose thee N.N. as my Brahman' (he chooses) the Brahman.
1	23	10	With (the formula), 'Âditya (the sun) is my Adhvaryu; (he is my Adhvaryu, &c.)'—the Adhvaryu.
1	23	11	With (the formula), 'Parganya is my Udgâtri; (he is my Udgâtri, &c.)'—the Udgâtri.
1	23	12	. With (the formula), 'The waters are my reciters of what belongs to the Hotrakas'—the Hotrakas.
1	23	13	. With (the formula), 'The rays are my Kamasâdhvaryus'—the Kamasâdhvaryus.
1	23	14	With (the formula), 'The ether is my Sadasya'—the Sadasya.
1	23	15	He whom he has chosen should murmur, 'A great thing thou hast told me; splendour thou hast told me; fortune thou hast told me; glory thou hast told me; praise thou hast told me; success thou hast told me; enjoyment thou hast told me; satiating thou hast told me; everything thou hast told me.'
1	23	16	Having murmured (this formula), the Hotri declares his assent (in the words), 'Agni is thy Hotri; he is thy Hotri; thy human Hotri am I.'
1	23	17	'Kandramas (the moon) is thy Brahman; he is thy Brahman (&c.)'—thus the Brahman.
1	23	18	In the same way the others according to the prescriptions (given above).
1	23	19	. And if (the priest who accepts the invitation)is going to perform the sacrifice (for the inviting person, he should add), 'May that bless me; may that enter upon me; may I thereby enjoy (bliss).'
1	23	20	. The functions of an officiating priest are not to be exercised, if abandoned (by another priest), or at an Ahîna sacrifice with small sacrificial fee, or for a person that is sick, or suffering, or affected with consumption, or decried among the people in his village, or of despised extraction: for such persons (the functions of a Ritvig should not be exercised).
1	23	21	. He (who is chosen as a Ritvig) should ask the Somapravâka, 'What sacrifice is it? Who arethe priests officiating? What is the fee for the sacrifice?'
1	23	22	If (all the conditions) are favourable, he should accept.
1	23	23	Let (the officiating priests) eat no flesh nor have intercourse with a wife until the completion of the sacrifice.
1	23	24	'By this prayer, O Agni, increase' —with (this verse) let him offer (at the end of the sacrifice) an oblation of Âgya in (his own) Dakshinâgni, and go away where he likes;
1	23	25	In the same way one who has not set up the (Srauta) fires, in his (sacred) domestic fire with this Rik, 'Forgive us, O Agni, this sin' .
1	24	1	. When he has chosen the Ritvigas, he should offer the Madhuparka (i.e. honey-mixture) to them ;
1	24	2	To a Snâtaka, when he comes to his house;
1	24	3	And to a king;
1	24	4	And for a teacher, the father-in-law, a paternal uncle, and a maternal uncle.
1	24	5	He pours honey into curds,
1	24	6	Or butter, if he can get no honey.
1	24	7	A seat, the water for washing the feet, the Arghya water (i.e. perfumed water into which flowers have been thrown), the water for sipping, the honey-mixture,a cow: every one of these things they announce three times (to the guest).
1	24	8	With (the verse), 'I am the highest one among my people, as the sun among the thunderbolts. Here I tread on him whosoever infests me'—he should sit down on the seat (made of) northward-pointed (grass).
1	24	9	Or (he should do so) after he has trodden on it.
1	24	10	He should make (his host) wash his feet.
1	24	11	The right foot he should stretch out first to a Brâhmana,
1	24	12	The left to a Sûdra.
1	24	13	When his feet have been washed, he receives the Arghya water in the hollow of his joined hands and then sips the water destined thereto, with (the formula), 'Thou art the first layer for Ambrosia.'
1	24	14	He looks at the Madhuparka when it is brought to him, with (the formula), 'I look at thee with Mitra's eye.'
1	24	15	He accepts it with his joined hands with (the formula), 'By the impulse of the god Sâvitrî, with the arms of the two Asvins, with the hands of Pûshan I accept thee.' He then takes it into his left hand, looks at it with the three verses, 'Honey the winds to the righteous one' , stirs it about three times from left to right with the fourth finger and the thumb, and wipes (his fingers) with (the formula), 'May the Vasus eat thee with the Gâyatrî metre'—to the east;
1	24	16	With (the formula), 'May the Rudras eat thee with the Trishtubh metre'—to the south;
1	24	17	With (the formula), 'May the Âdityas eat thee with the Gagatî metre'—to the west;
1	24	18	With (the formula), 'May the Visve devâs eat thee with the Anushtubh metre'—to the north.
1	24	19	With (the formula), 'To the beings thee'—he three times takes (some of the Madhuparka substance) out of the middle of it.
1	24	20	With (the formula), 'The milk of Virâg art thou'—he should partake thereof the first time,
1	24	21	With, 'The milk of Virâg may I obtain'—the second time,
1	24	22	. With, 'In me (may) the milk of Padyâ Virâg (dwell)'—the third time.
1	24	23	(He should) not (eat) the whole (Madhuparka).
1	24	24	He should not satiate himself.
1	24	25	To a Brâhmana, to the north, he should give the remainder.
1	24	26	If that cannot be done, (he should throw it) into water.
1	24	27	Or (he may eat) the whole (Madhuparka).
1	24	28	. He then makes a rinsing of his mouth follow (on the eating of the Madhuparka) with the water destined thereto, with (the formula), 'Thou art the covering of Ambrosia.'
1	24	29	With (the formula), 'Truth! Glory! Fortune! May fortune rest on me!'—a second time.
1	24	30	When he has sipped water, they announce to him the cow.
1	24	31	Having murmured, 'Destroyed is my sin; my sin is destroyed,' (he says,) 'Om, do it,' if he chooses to have her killed.
1	24	32	Having murmured, 'The mother of the Rudras, the daughter of the Vasus' ,[paragraph continues] (he says,) 'Om, let her loose,' if he chooses to let her loose.
1	24	33	. Let the Madhuparka not be without flesh, without flesh.End of the First Adhyâya.
2	1	1	. On the full moon day of the Srâvana month the Srâvana ceremony (is performed).
2	1	2	Having filled a new jug with flour of fried barley, he lays (this jug) and a spoon for offering the Balis on new strings of a carrying pole (and thus suspends them).
2	1	3	Having prepared fried barley grains, he smears half of them with butter.
2	1	4	After sunset he prepares a mess of cooked food and a cake in one dish and sacrifices (the cooked food) with the four verses, 'Agni, lead us on a good path to wealth' , verse by verse, and with his hand the (cake) in one dish with (the formula), 'To the steady One, the earth-demon, svâhâ!'
2	1	5	(The cake) should be (entirely) immersed (into the butter), or its back should be visible.
2	1	6	With (the verse), 'Agni, do not deliver us to evil'  he sacrifices over it (the butter) in which it had lain.
2	1	7	. With (the verse), 'May the steeds at our invocation be for a blessing to us'  (he sacrifices) the besmeared grains with his joined hands,
2	1	8	The other (grains) he should give to his people.
2	1	9	Out of the jug he fills the spoon with flour,goes out (of the house) to the east, pours water on the ground on a clean spot, sacrifices with (the formula), 'To the divine hosts of the serpents svâhâ!' and does reverence to them with (the formula), 'The serpents which are terrestrial, which are aerial, which are celestial, which dwell in the directions (of the horizon)—to them I have brought this Bali; to them I give over this Bali.'
2	1	10	Having gone round (the Bali) from left to right, he sits down to the west of the Bali with (the words), 'The serpent art thou; the lord of the creeping serpents art thou; by food thou protectest men, by cake the serpents, by sacrifice the gods. To me, being in thee, the serpents being in thee should do no harm. I give over the firm one (i.e. the spoon) to thee.'
2	1	11	'Firm one, (I give) N.N. (in charge) to thee! Firm one, (I give) N.N. (in charge) to thee!'—with (these words he gives) his people, man by man, (in charge to the serpent god);
2	1	12	'Firm one, I give myself in charge to thee!'—with these words himself at the end.
2	1	13	Let no one step between it (i.e. the Bali, and the sacrificer), until the giving in charge has been performed.
2	1	14	. With (the formula), 'To the divine hosts of the serpents svâhâ!'—let him offer the Bali in the evening and in the morning, till the Pratyavarohana (i.e. the ceremony of the 'redescent').
2	1	15	. Some count (the days till the Pratyavarohana)and offer the corresponding number of Balis already on that day (on which the Sravanâ ceremony is performed).
2	2	1	On the full moon day of Âsvayuga the Âsvayugî ceremony (is performed).
2	2	2	. Having adorned the house, having bathed and put on clean garments, they should pour out a mess of cooked food for Pasupati, and should sacrifice it with (the formula), To Pasupati, to Siva, to Samkara, to Prishâtaka svâhâ!'
2	2	3	He should sacrifice with his joined hands a mixture of curds and butter (prishâtaka) with (the formula), 'May what is deficient be made full to me; may what is full not decay to me. To Prishâtaka svâhâ!'
2	2	4	. 'United with the seasons, united with the manners, united with Indra and Agni, svâhâ!'United with the seasons, united with the manners, united with the Visve devâs, svâhâ!'United with the seasons, united with the manners, united with Heaven and Earth, svâhâ!'—with (these formulas) a mess of cooked food is offered at the[paragraph continues] Âgrayana sacrifice by one who has set up the (sacred Srauta) fires.
2	2	5	Also by one who has not set up the (Srauta) fires (the same offering is performed) in the (sacred) domestic fire.
2	3	1	. On the full moon of Mârgasîrsha the 'redescent' (is performed)—on the fourteenth (Tithi),
2	3	2	Or on (the Tithi of) the full moon (itself).
2	3	3	. Having again renovated the house by (giving a new) coating (to the walls), by spreading out (a new roof), and by levelling (the floor), they should sacrifice after sunset (oblations) of milk-rice with (the texts), 'Beat away, O white one, with thy foot, with the forefoot and with the hind-foot, these seven daughters of Varuna and all that belong to the king's tribe. Svâhâ!'Within the dominion of the white one no serpent has killed anything. To the white one, the son of Vidârva, adoration! Svâhâ!'
2	3	4	Here no oblation to (Agni) Svishtakrit (is made).
2	3	5	. 'May we be secure from Pragâpati's sons'—thus he murmurs while looking at the fire.
2	3	6	(Saying), 'Be happy and friendly to us'—he should think in his mind of the winter.
2	3	7	To the west of the fire is a well-spread layer (of straw); on that he should sit down, murmur (the verse), 'Be soft, O earth' , and lie down (on that layer) with his people, with the head to the east and the face to the north.
2	3	8	The others, as there is room.
2	3	9	Or following on each other from the eldest to the youngest.
2	3	10	. Those who know the Mantras, should murmur the Mantras.
2	3	11	. Arising (they should) three times (murmur the verse), 'From that place may the gods bless us' .
2	3	12	. The same (verse) a fourth time with their faces to the south, to the west, and to the north.
2	3	13	Having arisen, having murmured the hymns sacred to the Sun and the auspicious hymns, having prepared food and given to the Brâhmanas to eat, he should cause (them) to pronounce auspicious words.
2	4	1	. On the eighth days of the four dark fortnights of (the two seasons of) winter and Sisira the Ashtakâs (are celebrated).
2	4	2	. Or on one (of these days).
2	4	3	The day before, he should offer to the Fathers (i.e. Manes)—
2	4	4	Boiled rice, boiled rice with sesamum seeds, rice-milk—
2	4	5	Or cakes made of four Sarâvas (of ground grain)—
2	4	6	Sacrificing with the eight (verses), 'May the lower (Fathers) and the higher arise' , or with as many (verses) as he likes.
2	4	7	. Then on the next day the Ashtakâs (are celebrated) with an animal (sacrifice) and with a mess of cooked food.
2	4	8	He may also give grass to an ox,
2	4	9	Or he may burn down brushwood with fire—
2	4	10	With (the words), 'This is my Ashtakâ.'
2	4	11	But he should not omit celebrating the Ashtakâ.
2	4	12	This (Ashtakâ) some state to be sacred to the Visve devâs, some to Agni, some to the Sun, some to Pragâpati, some state that the Night is its deity, some that the Nakshatras are, some that the Seasons are, some that the Fathers are, some that cattle is.
2	4	13	. Having killed the animal according to theritual of the animal sacrifice, omitting the sprinkling (with water) and the touching of the animal with a fresh branch, he should draw out the omentum and sacrifice it with (the verse), 'Carry the omentum, Gâtavedas, to the Fathers, where thou knowest them resting afar. May streams of fat flow to them; may all these wishes be fulfilled. Svâhâ!'
2	4	14	. Then (follow oblations) of the Avadâna portions and the cooked food, two with (the two verses), 'Agni, lead us on a good path to wealth' , (and other oblations with the texts), 'May summer, winter, the seasons be happy to us, happy the rainy season, safe to us the autumn. The year be our lord who gives breath to us; may days and nights produce long life. Svâhâ!'Peaceful be the earth, happy the air, may the goddess Heaven give us safety. Happy be the quarters (of the horizon), the intermediate quarters, the upper quarters; may the waters, the lightnings protect us from all sides. Svâhâ!'May the waters, the rays carry our prayers (to the gods); may the creator, may the ocean turn away evil; may the past and the future, (may) all be safe to me. Protected by Brahman may I pour forth songs. Svâhâ!'May all the Âdityas and the divine Vasus, the Rudras, the protectors, the Maruts sit down (here). May Pragâpati, the abounding one, the highest ruler, bestow vigour, offspring, immortality on me. Svâhâ!'Pragâpati, no other one than Thou .'
2	4	15	The eighth (oblation) is that to (Agni) Svishtakrit.
2	4	16	. He should give to the Brâhmanas to eat: this has been said.
2	5	1	On the following day the Anvashtakya (i.e. the ceremony following the Ashtakâ, is performed).
2	5	2	. Having prepared (a portion) of that same meat, having established the fire on a surface inclined towards the south, having fenced it in, and made a door on the north side of the enclosure, having strewn round (the fire) three times sacrificial grass with its roots, without tossing it, turning the left side towards the fire, he should put down the things to be offered, boiled rice, boiled rice with sesamum seeds, rice-milk, meal-pap with curds, and meal-pap with honey.
2	5	3	. (The ceremony should be performed) according to the ritual of the Pindapitriyagña.
2	5	4	. Having sacrificed (of those sorts of food) with the exception of the meal-pap with honey, let him give (lumps of those substances) to the Fathers.
2	5	5	And to (their) wives, with the addition of rum and the scum of boiled rice.
2	5	6	Some (place the lumps to be offered) into pits, into two or into six:
2	5	7	In those situated to the east he should give (the offerings) to the Fathers.
2	5	8	In those to the west, to the wives.
2	5	9	. Thereby the ceremony celebrated in the rainy season on the Mâgha day, in the dark fortnight after the full moon of Praushthapada (has been declared).
2	5	10	. And thus he should offer (a celebration like the Anvashtakya) to the Fathers every month, observing uneven numbers (i.e. selecting a day with an uneven number, inviting an uneven number of Brâhmanas, &c.).
2	5	11	He should give food at least to nine (Brâhmanas),
2	5	12	Or to an uneven number;
2	5	13	. To an even number on auspicious occasions or on the performance of meritorious deeds (such as the consecration of ponds, &c.);
2	5	14	To an uneven number on other (occasions).
2	5	15	. The rite is performed from left to right. Barley is to be used instead of sesamum.
2	6	1	. When going to mount a chariot he should touch the wheels with his two hands separately with (the words), 'I touch thy two fore-feet. Thy two wheels are the Brihat and the Rathantara (Sâmans).'
2	6	2	. 'Thy axle is the Vâmadevya'—with (these words he touches) the two (naves) in which the axle rests.
2	6	3	He should mount (the chariot) with the right foot first, with (the words), 'With Vâyu's strength I mount thee, with Indra's power and sovereignty.'
2	6	4	He should touch the reins, or if the horses have no reins, (he should touch) the horses with a staff, with (the words), 'With Brahman's splendour I seize you. With truth I seize you.'
2	6	5	When (the horses) put themselves in motion, he should murmur, 'Go forward to thousandfold successful vigour, divine chariot, carry us forward!'—(and the verse), 'Free, strong be thy limbs!'
2	6	6	. With this (verse he should touch also) other articles of wood.
2	6	7	'May the two oxen be strong, the axle firm' —with (this verse) he should touch (each) part of the chariot (alluded to in that verse).
2	6	8	With (the verse), 'The earth, the good protectress, the unattained heaven'  (he should ascend) a ship.
2	6	9	With a new chariot he should drive round a widely known tree or round a pool that does not dry up, with his right side turned towards it, and then should fetch branches which bear fruits,
2	6	10	Or something else that belongs to the household.
2	6	11	(He then) should drive (in that chariot) to an assembly.
2	6	12	Having murmured, while looking at the sun, (the verse), 'Make our renown highest' , he should descend.
2	6	13	'To the bull among my equals' —(this verse he should murmur) while approaching (that assembly?).
2	6	14	'May we be called to-day Indra's best friends' —when the sun is setting.
2	6	15	'Thus I address you, O daughters of heaven, while you arise' —when day appears.
2	7	1	Now the examination of the ground (where he intends to build a house).
2	7	2	(It must be) non-salinous soil of undisputed property,
2	7	3	With herbs and trees,
2	7	4	On which much Kusa and Vîrana grass grows.
2	7	5	Plants with thorns and with milky juice he should dig out with their roots and remove them—
2	7	6	And in the same way the following (sorts of plants), viz. Apâmârga, potherbs, Tilvaka, Parivyâdha.
2	7	7	A spot where the waters, flowing together from all sides to the centre of it, flow round the resting-place, having it on their right side, and then flow off to the east without noise—that possesses all auspicious qualities.
2	7	8	Where the waters flow off, he should have the provision-room built.
2	7	9	Thus it becomes rich in food.
2	7	10	On a spot which is inclined towards the south, he should have the assembly-room constructed; thus there will be no gambling in it.
2	7	11	(But others say that) in such (an assembly-room) the young people become gamblers, quarrelsome, and die early.
2	7	12	Where the waters flow together from all directions, that assembly-room (situated on such a spot) brings luck and is free from gambling.
2	8	1	Now he should examine the ground in the following ways.
2	8	2	He should dig a pit knee-deep and fill it again with the same earth (which he has taken out of it).
2	8	3	If (the earth) reaches out (of the pit, the ground is) excellent; if it is level, (it is) of middle quality; if it does not fill (the pit, it is) to be rejected.
2	8	4	After sunset he should fill (the pit) with water and leave it so through the night.
2	8	5	If (in the morning) there is water in it, (the ground is) excellent; if it is moist, (it is) of middle quality; if it is dry, (it is) to be rejected.
2	8	6	White (ground), of sweet taste, with sand on the surface, (should be elected) by a Brâhmana.
2	8	7	Red (ground) for a Kshatriya.
2	8	8	Yellow (ground) for a Vaisya.
2	8	9	He should draw a thousand furrows on it and should have it measured off as quadrangular, with equal sides to each (of the four) directions;
2	8	10	Or as an oblong quadrangle.
2	8	11	. With a Samî branch or an Udumbara branch he sprinkles it (with water), going thrice round it, so that his right side is turned towards it, reciting the Santâtîya hymn.
2	8	12	And (so he does again three times) pouring out water without interruption, with the three verses, 'O waters, ye are wholesome' .
2	8	13	. In the interstices between the bamboo staffs he should have the (single) rooms constructed.
2	8	14	Into the pits in which the posts are to stand, he should have an Avakâ, i.e. (the water-plant called) Sîpâla put down; then fire will not befall him: thus it is understood (in the Sruti).
2	8	15	. Having put (that plant) into the pit in which the middle-post is to stand, he should spread (on it) eastward-pointed and northward-pointed Kusa grass and should sprinkle (on that grass) water into which rice and barley have been thrown, with (the words), 'To the steady one, the earth-demon, svâhâ!'
2	8	16	. He then should, when (the middle-post) is being erected, recite over it (the two verses), 'Stand here, fixed in the ground, prosperous, long-lasting (?),standing amid prosperity. May the malevolent ones not attain thee!'To thee (may) the young child (come), to thee the calf . . .; to thee (may) the cup of Parisrut (come); (to thee) may they come with pots of curds.'
2	9	1	(Over) the bamboo staff, when it is put on (the middle-post, he recites the hemistich),
2	9	2	'Rightly ascend the post, O staff, bestowing on us long life henceforward.'
2	9	3	On four stones, on which Dûrvâ grass has been spread, he should establish the water-barrel with (the words), 'Arise on the earth'—
2	9	4	. Or with (the verse), 'The Araṅgara sounds, three times bound with the strap. It praises the welfare; may it drive away ill.'
2	9	5	He then should pour water into it with (the verse), 'Hither may king Varuna come with the plentiful (waters); at this place may he stay contented; bringing welfare, dropping ghee may they lie down together with Mitra.'
2	9	6	. He then 'appeases' it (in the following way).
2	9	7	. He puts gold into water into which rice and barley have been thrown, and (with that water) he sprinkles it three times, going round it with his right side turned towards it, with the Santâtîya hymn.
2	9	8	. And (so he does again three times) pouring outwater without interruption, with the three verses, 'O waters, ye are wholesome' .
2	9	9	. In the middle of the house he should cook a mess of food, sacrifice (therefrom) with the four verses, 'Vâstoshpati, accept us' , verse by verse, should prepare food, should give to the Brâhmanas to eat, and should cause them to say, 'Lucky is the ground! Lucky is the ground!'
2	10	1	. It has been declared how he should enter the house (when returning from a journey).
2	10	2	The house, when he enters it, should be provided with seed-corn.
2	10	3	. He should have his field ploughed under the Nakshatras Uttarâh Proshthapadâs, (Uttarâh) Phâlgunyas, or Rohinî.
2	10	4	In order that the wind may blow to him from the field, he should offer oblations with the hymn, 'Through the lord of the field' , verse by verse, or he should murmur (that hymn).
2	10	5	. He should speak over the cows when they go away, the two verses, 'May refreshing wind blow over the cows' .
2	10	6	. When they come back, (he should recite the following verses,)'May they whose udder with its four holes is fullof honey and ghee, be milk-givers to us; (may they be) many in our stable, rich in ghee.'Come hither to me, giving refreshment, bringing vigour and strength. Giving inexhaustible milk, rest in my stable that I may become the highest one'And, 'They who have raised their body up to the gods'—the rest of the hymn .
2	10	7	. Some recite  the Âgâvîya hymn.
2	10	8	. He should approach their herds, if the cows do not belong to his Guru, with (the words), 'Prospering are ye; excellent are ye, beautiful, dear. May I become dear to you. May you see bliss in me.'End of the Second Adhyâya.
3	1	1	Now (follow) the five sacrifices:
3	1	2	The sacrifice to the Gods, the sacrifice to the Beings, the sacrifice to the Fathers, the sacrifice to Brahman, the sacrifice to men.
3	1	3	Here now, if he makes oblations over the (sacred) fire, this is the sacrifice to the Gods.If he makes Bali offerings, this is the sacrifice to the Beings.If he gives (Pinda offerings) to the Fathers, this is the sacrifice to the Fathers.If he studies (Vedic) texts, this is the sacrifice to Brahman.If he gives to men, this is the sacrifice to men.
3	1	4	These (five kinds of) sacrifices he should perform every day.
3	2	1	. Now the rules how one should recite (the Vedic texts) for one's self.
3	2	2	He should go out of the village to the east or to the north, bathe in water, sip water on a clean spot, clad with the sacrificial cord; he should spread out, his garment being not wet, a great quantity of Darbha grass, the tufts of which are directed towards the east, and should sit down thereon with his face turned to the east, making a lap, putting together his hands in which he holds purifiers (i.e. Kusa blades), so that the right hand lies uppermost.It is understood (in the Sruti), 'This is what Darbha grass is: it is the essence of waters and herbs. He thus makes the Brahman provided with essence.'Looking at the point where heaven and earth touch each other, or shutting his eyes, or in whatever way he may deem himself apt (for reciting the Veda), thus adapting himself he should recite (the sacred texts) for himself.
3	2	3	The Vyâhritis preceded by (the syllable) Om (are pronounced first).
3	2	4	He (then) repeats the Sâvitrî , (firstly) Pâda by Pâda, (then) hemistich by hemistich, thirdly the whole.
3	3	1	. He then should recite for himself (the following texts, viz.) the Rikas, the Yagus, the Sâmans, the Atharvan and Aṅgiras hymns, the Brâhmanas, the Kalpa (Sûtras), the Gâthâs, the (texts in honour of kings and heroes, called) Nârâsamsîs, the Itihâsas and Purânas.
3	3	2	In that he recites the Rikas, he thereby satiates the gods with oblations of milk—in that (he recites) the Yagus, with oblations of ghee—the Sâmans, with oblations of honey—the Atharvan and Aṅgiras hymns, with oblations of Soma—the Brâhmanas, Kalpas, Gâthâs, Nârâsamsîs, Itihâsas and Purânas, with oblations of ambrosia.
3	3	3	In that he recites the Rikas, rivers of milk flow, as a funeral oblation, to his Fathers. In that (he recites) the Yagus, rivers of ghee—the Sâmans, rivers of honey—the Atharvan and Aṅgiras hymns, rivers of Soma—the Brâhmanas, Kalpas, Gâthâs, Nârâsamsîs, Itihâsas and Purânas, rivers of ambrosia.
3	3	4	After he has recited (those texts) as far as he thinks fit, he should finish with the following (verse),'Adoration to Brahman! Adoration be to Agni! Adoration to the Earth! Adoration to the Herbs! Adoration to the Voice! Adoration to the Lord of the Voice! Adoration I bring to great Vishnu!'
3	4	1	. He satiates the deities: 'Pragâpati, Brahman, the Vedas, the gods, the Rishis, all metres, the word Om, the word Vashat, the Vyâhritis, the Sâvitrî, the sacrifices, Heaven and Earth, the air, days and nights, the numbers, the Siddhas, the oceans, the rivers, the mountains, the fields, herbs, trees, Gandharvas and Apsaras, the snakes, the birds, the cows, the Sâdhyas, the Vipras, the Yakshas, the Rakshas, the beings that have these (Rakshas, &c.) at their end.'
3	4	2	. Then the Rishis: 'The (Rishis) of the hundred (Rikas), the (Rishis) of the middle (Mandalas), Gritsamada,[paragraph continues] Visvâmitra, Vâmadeva, Atri, Bharadvâga, Vasishtha, the Pragâthas, the Pavamâna hymns, the (Rishis) of the short hymns, and of the long hymns.'
3	4	3	(Then) with the sacrificial cord suspended over the right shoulder:
3	4	4	. 'Sumantu, Gaimini, Vaisampâyana, Paila, the Sûtras, the Bhâshyas, the Bhârata, the Mahâbhârata, the teachers of law, Gânanti, Bâhavi, Gârgya, Gautama, Sâkalya, Bâbhravya, Mândavya, Mândûkeya, Gârgî Vâkaknavî, Vadavâ Prâtîtheyî, Sulabhâ Maitreyî, Kahola Kaushîtaka, Mahâkaushîtaka, Paiṅgya, Mahâpaiṅgya, Suyagña Sâṅkhâyana, Aitareya, Mahaitareya, the Sâkala (text), the Bâshkala (text), Sugâtavaktra, Audavâhi, Mahaudavâhi, Saugâmi, Saunaka, Âsvalâyana—and whatsoever other teachers there are, may they all satiate themselves.'
3	4	5	. After he has satiated the Fathers man by man, and has returned to his house, what he gives (then), that is the sacrificial fee.
3	4	6	. And it is also understood (in the Sruti), 'May he be standing, walking, sitting, or lying, (the texts belonging to) whatsoever sacrifice he repeats, that sacrifice indeed he has offered.'
3	4	7	It is understood (in the Sruti), 'Regarding this (Svâdhyâya) there are two cases in which the study (of the sacred texts) is forbidden: when he is impure himself, and when the place is.'
3	5	1	Now (follows) the Adhyâyopâkarana (i.e. the ceremony by which the annual course of study is opened);
3	5	2	. When the herbs appear, (when the moon stands in conjunction) with Sravana, in the Srâvana month,
3	5	3	Or on the fifth (Tithi of that month), under (the Nakshatra) Hasta.
3	5	4	. Having sacrificed the two Âgya portions, he should offer Âgya oblations (to the following deities, viz.) Sâvitrî, Brahman, Belief, Insight, Wisdom, Memory, Sadasaspati, Anumati, the metres, and the Rishis.
3	5	5	He then sacrifices grains with curds (with the following texts):
3	5	6	'I praise Agni the Purohita'—this one verse ,
3	5	7	. 'The Kushumbhaka (mungoose?) has said it'—'If thou criest, O bird, announce luck to us Sung by Gamadagni'—'In thy abode the whole world rests'[paragraph continues] —'Come to our sacrifice, O you that are worthy of sacrifice, with care'—'Whosoever, be he ours, be he alien'—'Look on, look about'—'Come here, Agni, the Maruts' friend'—'The oblation, O king, cooked for thee'—each time two verses;
3	5	8	'United is your will' —this one verse;
3	5	9	. 'That blessing and bliss we choose'—this one verse.
3	5	10	. When he intends to study (the Veda together with pupils), he should, while the pupils take hold of him, sacrifice to those deities, and sacrifice to (Agni) Svishtakrit, and partake of the grains with curds; then (follows) the 'cleaning.'
3	5	11	. Sitting down to the west of the fire on Darbha grass, the tufts of which are directed towards the east, he should put Darbha blades into a water-pot, and making a Brahmâñgali (i.e. joining his hands as a sign of veneration for the Brahman), he should murmur (the following texts):
3	5	12	The Vyâhritis preceded by (the syllable) Om (stand first); (these) and the Sâvitrî he should repeat three times and then recite the beginning of the Veda.
3	5	13	In the same way at the Utsarga (i.e. at the ceremony performed at the end of the term of Vedic study).
3	5	14	He should study six months.
3	5	15	. One who has performed the Samâvartana (should live during that time) according to the regulations for Brahmakârins.
3	5	16	. The others according to the rules.
3	5	17	. Some say that he should have intercourse with his wife.
3	5	18	That (is a practice) sacred to Pragâpati.
3	5	19	This (Upâkarana) they call vârshika (i.e. belonging to the rainy season).
3	5	20	. On the middle Ashtakâ they offer food to those deities, and descend into water.
3	5	21	They satiate those same deities (with water oblations),
3	5	22	(And besides) the Âkâryas, the Rishis, and the Fathers.
3	5	23	. This is the Utsargana.
3	6	1	. Instead of the Kâmya ceremonies (i.e. the ceremonies, prescribed in the Srauta-sûtra, by whichspecial wishes are attained, oblations of) boiled (rice) grains, for the attainment of those wishes, (should be made by the Grihya sacrificer).
3	6	2	He attains (thereby) those same wishes.
3	6	3	For a person that is sick, or suffering, or affected with consumption, a mess of boiled (rice) grains in six oblations (should he offered)—
3	6	4	With this (hymn), 'I loosen thee by sacrificial food, that thou mayst live' .
3	6	5	If he has seen a bad dream, he should worship the sun with the two verses, 'To-day, god Savitri' , and with the five verses, 'What bad dreams there are among the cows' ,
3	6	6	Or with (the verse), 'Whosoever, O king, be it a companion or a friend' .
3	6	7	When he has sneezed, yawned, seen a disagreeable sight, smelt a bad smell, when his eye palpitates, and when he hears noises in his ears, he should murmur, 'Well-eyed may I become with my eyes, well-vigoured with my face, well-hearing with my ears. May will and insight dwell in me!'
3	6	8	. If he has gone to a wife to whom he ought not to go, or if he has performed a sacrifice for a person for whom he ought not to do so, or has eaten forbidden food, or accepted what he ought not to accept, or pushed against a piled-up (fire altar) oragainst a sacrificial post, he should sacrifice two Âgya oblations with (the verses),'May my faculties return into me, may life return, may prosperity return; may my goods return to me; may the divine power return into me. Svâhâ!'These fires that are stationed on the (altars called) Dhishnyâs, may they be here in good order, each on its right place. (Agni) Vaisvânara, grown strong, the standard of immortality, may he govern my mind in my heart. Svâhâ!'
3	6	9	Or (he may sacrifice) two pieces of wood,
3	6	10	Or murmur (the same two verses without any oblation).
3	7	1	If the sun sets while he is sleeping without being sick, he should spend the rest of the night keeping silence, without sitting down, and should worship the sun (when it rises) with the five (verses), 'The light, O sun, by which thou destroyest darkness' .
3	7	2	. If (the sun) rises (while he is sleeping without being sick), being fatigued without having done any work, or having done work that is not becoming, he should keep silence, &c., as before, and perform his worship (to the sun) with the following four .
3	7	3	. Invested with the sacrificial cord, constantly fulfilling the prescribed duties regarding the use ofwater, he should perform the Sandhyâ (or twilight devotion), observing silence.
3	7	4	In the evening he should, turning his face to the north-west, to the region between the chief (west) point and the intermediate (north-western) point (of the horizon), murmur the Sâvitrî, (beginning) when the sun is half set, until the stars appear.
3	7	5	In the same way in the morning—
3	7	6	Standing, with his face turned to the east, until the disk (of the sun) appears.
3	7	7	If a dove flies against his house or towards it, he should sacrifice with (the hymn), 'O gods, the dove' , verse by verse, or should murmur (that hymn).
3	7	8	'We have thee, O Lord of the path' —if he is going out for doing some business.
3	7	9	. 'Bring us together, Pûshan, with a knowing one' —if he wishes to find something lost, or if he has strayed.
3	7	10	'Journey over the ways, Pûshan' —if he is going out on a long or dangerous way.
3	8	1	Now when returning (home from his teacher) he should get the following things, viz. a jewel (to be tied round the neck), two ear-rings, a pair of garments, a parasol, a pair of shoes, a staff, a wreath, (pounded seed of the Karañga fruit) for rubbing with, ointment, eye salve, a turban; (all that) for himself and for the teacher.
3	8	2	If he cannot get it for both, only for the teacher.
3	8	3	He then should get a piece of wood of a tree which is sacrificially pure, in a north-eastern direction—
3	8	4	Sappy (wood) if he wishes for the enjoyment of food, or for prosperity, or for splendour; dry (wood), if for holy lustre,
3	8	5	(Wood) which is both (sappy and dry, in its different parts), if (he wishes) for both.
3	8	6	. Having put the piece of wood on high, and having given a cow and food to the Brâhmanas, he should perform the ceremony of shaving the beard.
3	8	7	. He should alter the texts so that they refer to himself.
3	8	8	. With Ekaklîtaka (he should perform the rubbing).
3	8	9	Having washed himself with lukewarm water, and having put on two (new) garments which have not yet been washed, with (the verse), 'Garments with fat splendour you put on, (Mitra and Varuna)' ; he should anoint his eyes with (the words), 'The sharpness of the stone art thou; protect my eye.'
3	8	10	With (the words), 'The sharpness of the stoneart thou; protect my ear'—he should tie on the two ear-rings.
3	8	11	After having salved his two hands with ointment, a Brâhmana should salve his head first,
3	8	12	A Râganya his two arms,
3	8	13	A Vaisya the belly,
3	8	14	A woman her secret parts,
3	8	15	Persons who gain their livelihood by running, their thighs.
3	8	16	With (the formula), 'Free from pain art thou, free from pain may I become'—he should put on the wreath.
3	8	17	Not (such a wreath) which is called mâlâ.
3	8	18	If they call it mâlâ, he should cause them to call it srag.
3	8	19	With (the formula), 'The standing-places of the gods are you; protect me from all sides'—he steps into the shoes, and with (the formula), 'The heaven's covering art thou'—he takes the parasol.
3	8	20	With (the formula), 'Reed thou art; from the tree thou descendest; protect me from all sides'—(he takes) a staff of reed.
3	8	21	. Having with the hymn 'Giving life' tied the jewel to his neck and arranged the turban (on his head), he should standing put the piece of wood (on the fire).
3	9	1	. (He says), 'Memory and reproach and knowledge, faith, and wisdom as the fifth, what is sacrificed, and what is given, and what is studied, and what is done, truth, learning, vow—'The vow which belongs to Agni together with Indra, with Pragâpati, with the Rishis, with the royal ones among the Rishis, with the Fathers, with the royal ones among the Fathers, with the human beings, with the royal ones among the human beings, with shine, over-shine, after-shine, counter-shine, with gods and men, with Gandharvas and Apsaras, with wild animals and domestic animals,—the vow, belonging to my own self, dwelling in my own self, that is my universal vow. Hereby, O Agni, I become addicted to the universal vow. Svâhâ!'
3	9	2	. With (the hymn), 'Mine, Agni, be vigour' , verse by verse, he should put pieces of wood (on the fire).
3	9	3	. He should pass that night at a place where they will do honour to him.
3	9	4	. When, after having finished his (task of) learning, he has offered something to the teacher, or has received his permission, he should take a bath (which signifies the end of his studentship).
3	9	5	He (i.e. the Snâtaka) has to keep the following observances:
3	9	6	He shall not bathe in the night-time; he shall not bathe naked; he shall not lie down naked; he shall not look at a naked woman, except during sexual intercourse; he shall not run during rain; he shall not climb up a tree; he shall not descend into a well; he shall not swim with his arms across a river; he shall not expose himself to danger. 'A great being indeed is a Snâtaka'—thus it is understood (in the Sruti).
3	10	1	. If (a student) wishes to be dismissed (by his teacher), he should pronounce before the teacher his (i.e. the teacher's?) name—
3	10	2	. (And should say), 'Here we will dwell, sir!'
3	10	3	With a loud voice (the words) following after the name.
3	10	4	'Of inhalation and exhalation'—(this he says) with a low voice,
3	10	5	And (the verse), 'Come hither, Indra, with thy lovely-sounding, fallow-coloured (horses)' .
3	10	6	. The aged one then murmurs, 'To inhalation and exhalation I, the wide-extended one, resort with thee. To the god Savitri I give thee in charge'—and the verse.
3	10	7	When he has finished (that verse), and has muttered, 'Om! Forwards! Blessing!' and recited (over the student the hymn), 'The great bliss of the three' —(he should dismiss him).
3	10	8	On one who has been thus dismissed, danger comes from no side—thus it is understood (in the Sruti).

4	4	5	. If (the three fires) reach (the body) in the same moment, they say that this signifies the highest luck.
4	4	6	. While (the body) is burning, he recites over it the same texts, 'Go on, go on, on the ancient paths' .
4	4	7	Being burnt by a person who knows this, he goes to the heaven-world together with the smoke (of the funeral pile)—thus it is understood (in the Sruti).
4	4	8	. To the north-east of the Âhavanîya fire he should have a knee-deep pit dug and should have an Avakâ, i.e. (the water-plant called) Sîpâla put down into it.

4	7	3	The larger their number is, the greater is the reward (which the sacrificer is entitled to expect).
4	7	4	But in no case one (Brâhmana) for all (the fathers).
4	7	5	. Optionally (he may invite only one Brâhmana) except at the first (Srâddha).
4	7	6	. By (the exposition of) the Pinda sacrifice (the corresponding rules) have been declared (for the Srâddha ceremonies also).

4	7	12	. (The different rites are performed) from the right to the left.
4	7	13	. With (the part) of the other (i.e. left) hand between the thumb (and the fore-finger), because he wears the sacrificial cord over his left shoulder, or with the right hand which he seizes with the left (he offers the Arghya water to the Fathers with the words), 'Father, this is thy Arghya. Grandfather, this is thy Arghya. Great-grandfather, this is thy Arghya'—having first offered (ordinary) water (to the Fathers).
4	7	14	When he is going to hand over that (Arghya water to the Brâhmanas who represent the Fathers, he says once each time), 'Svadhâ! The Arghya water!'
4	7	15	. Over (the Arghya water) which has beenpoured out, he should recite the verse, 'The celestial waters which have been produced on the earth, the aerial waters and the waters which are terrestrial, the gold-coloured ones, apt for sacrifice, may these waters bring us luck and be kind to us.' Pouring together what has been left (in the three Arghya vessels) he moistens his face with that water, if he desires that a son should be born to him.
4	7	16	. 'He should not take up the first vessel, into which the Arghya water for the Fathers has been poured. Hidden the Fathers dwell therein: thus Saunaka has said.'
4	7	17	. In that moment the gifts of perfumes, garlands, incense, lights, and clothes are offered (to the Brâhmanas).
4	7	18	Having taken some food (of the Sthâlîpâka prepared for the Pindapitriyagña), and having besmeared it with ghee, he asks (the Brâhmanas) for their permission by saying, 'I shall offer it in the fire,' or, 'I will sacrifice my offering in the fire,' or, 'I will offer it in the fire.'
4	7	19	The permission (is given in the words), 'It may be offered,' or, 'Sacrifice thy offering,' or, Offer it.'

4	7	22	'The mouth of the gods verily is the fire, the mouth of the Fathers is the hand'—thus says the Brâhmana.
4	7	23	If in the hands, he assigns to them other food, after they have sipped water.
4	7	24	. The food (is put together) with the food.
4	7	25	. It is said, 'What is given away and offered, that brings prosperity.'

4	7	27	. Having asked them, 'Relished?' and having taken the food, whatever food he has used, together with the Sthâlîpâka, in order to make lumps thereof, he should offer the rest (to the Brâhmanas).
4	7	28	After they have either accepted (that rest of food), or left it (to him), and have finished eating, he should, before they have sipped water, put down the lumps for the Fathers.
4	7	29	After they have sipped water, according to some (teachers).
4	7	30	. Having strewn the food on the ground and suspended the sacrificial cord over his left shoulder, he should dismiss the Brâhmanas, (saying to them), 'Say Om! Svadhâ!'
4	7	31	Or, 'So be it! Svadhâ!'

4	8	8	From head to tail,
4	8	9	With (the formula), 'Grow up, agreeable to Rudra the great god.'
4	8	10	. He should let it grow up. When it has cut its teeth, or when it has become a bull—
4	8	11	. To a quarter (of the horizon) which is sacrificially pure,
4	8	12	At a place which cannot be seen from the village,
4	8	13	After midnight,
4	8	14	According to some, after sunrise.
4	8	15	. Having caused a Brahman who is versed in learning and knows the practice (of this sacrifice), to sit down, having driven a fresh branch with leaves into the ground as a sacrificial post, (having taken) two creeping plants or two Kusa ropes as two girdles, and having wound the one round the sacrificial post, and tied the other round the middle of the animal's head, he binds it to the sacrificial post or to the girdle (which he had tied to that post) with (the formula), 'Agreeable to him to whom adoration (is brought), I bind thee.'
4	8	16	. The sprinkling with water and what follows is the same as at the animal sacrifice.
4	8	17	We shall state what is different.
4	8	18	Let him sacrifice the omentum with the Pâtrî or with a leaf—thus it is understood (in the Sruti)—
4	8	19	With (the formulas), 'To Hara, Mrida, Sarva, Siva, Bhava, Mahâdeva, Ugra, Bhîma, Pasupati, Rudra, Saṅkara, Îsâna svâhâ!'
4	8	20	Or with the last six (parts of that formula),
4	8	21	Or with (the formula), 'To Rudra svâhâ!'
4	8	22	. Let him make Bali offerings towards the four quarters (of the horizon), to each on four rings of Kusa net-work, with (the formulas), 'The hosts, Rudra, which thou hast towards the eastern direction,to them this (offering is brought). Adoration to thee! Do no harm to me!' In this way the assigning (of the offerings is performed) according to the different quarters (of the horizon).
