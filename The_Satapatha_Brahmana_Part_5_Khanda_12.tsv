1	1	1	Verily, this sacrifice is the same as this blowing (wind): it is that  they wish to secure who take the vow of initiation for a year. Of them the Grihapati is initiated first ; for the Grihapati is this (terrestrial) world, and upon this world everything here is established; and so, indeed, are his fellow-sacrificers established in the Grihapati: it is thus after they have become established on a firm foundation that they are initiated.
1	1	2	He (the Adhvaryu) then initiates the Brahman (priest). Now the Brahman is the moon, and the moon is Soma, and plants belong to Soma : he thus connects the plants with this (terrestrial) world. Therefore no other person should be initiated between those two; for, assuredly, were any one else to be initiated between those two, he would separate (tear up) the plants from this (terrestrial) world, and they would be liable to dry up: let therefore no other person be initiated between those two.
1	1	3	He then initiates the Udgâtri. Now, the Udgâtri is the thunder-cloud, and from the thundercloud rain is produced: he thus connects the rainwith the plants. Therefore no other person should be initiated between those two; for, assuredly, were any one else to be initiated between those two, he would separate the rain from the plants, and (the cloud) would be liable to lack rain: let therefore no other person be initiated between those two.
1	1	4	He then initiates the Ho tri. Now, the Hotri  is Agni in respect of the deity, and speech in respect of the body; and rain is food: he thus connects both Agni (fire) and speech with food. Therefore no other person should be initiated between those two; for, assuredly, were any one else to be initiated between those two, he would separate fire and speech from food, and (people) would be liable to starve: let therefore no other person be initiated between those two.
1	1	5	The Pratiprasthâtri then initiates the Adhvaryu. Now, the Adhvaryu is the mind , and the Hotri is speech: he thus connects mind and speech with one another. Therefore no other person should be initiated between those two; for, assuredly, were any one else to be initiated between those two, he would separate mind and speech, and (people) would be liable to perish: let therefore no other person be initiated between those two.
1	1	6	He then initiates the Brâhmanâkhamsin for the Brahman, for under him the former is. He then initiates the Prastotri for the Udgâtri, for underhim the former is. He then initiates the Maitrâvaruna for the Hotri, for under him the former is. These four the Pratiprasthâtri initiates.
1	1	7	The Neshtri then initiates the Pratiprasthâtri for the Adhvaryu, for under him the former is. It is after the fitting out  of these nine that the others are fitted out; for there are nine vital airs: he thus lays the vital airs into them; and so they attain the full term of life, and so they do not depart this world before their (full) term of life.
1	1	8	He then initiates the Potri for the Brahman, for under him the former is. He then initiates the Pratihartri for the Udgâtri, for under him the former is. He then initiates the Akhâvâka for the Hotri, for under him the former is. These four the Neshtri initiates.
1	1	9	The Unnetri then initiates the Neshtri for the Adhvaryu, for under him the former is. He then initiates the Âgnîdhra for the Brahman, for under him the former is. He then initiates the Subrahmanyâ for the Udgâtri, for under him the former is. He then initiates the Grâvastut for the Hotri, for under him the former is. These four the Unnetri initiates.
1	1	10	Either a Snâtaka , or a Brahmakârin, or some one else who is not initiated, then initiates the Unnetri; for they say, 'No pure one should purify.' This is the regular order of initiation ;and; assuredly, only when, knowing this , they become initiated, they make ready the sacrifice even whilst being initiated, and along with the getting ready of the sacrifice security of property accrues to the performers of the sacrificial session (Sattra); and, along with the accruing of security of property to the performers of the session, security of property also accrues to that district in which they perform the sacrifice.
1	1	11	Now, the Unnetri is initiated last of these, and when they come out from the purificatory bath it is he that comes out first; for the Unnetri is the vital air: he thus lays vital air into them on both sides; and so they attain the full term of life, and so they do not depart this world before their (full) term of life. This is the regular order of initiation: and, assuredly, he should become initiated only where such as know this become initiated.
1	2	1	Verily, from out of faith the gods fashioned the initiation, from out of Aditi the opening (sacrifice ), from out of Soma the buying (of Soma-plants), from out of Vishnu the guest-offering, from out of the sun the Pravargya, from out of the Svadhâ (the food of departed ancestors) the Upasads,from out of Agni and Soma the day of fasting, and from out of this world the opening Atirâtra .
1	2	2	From out of the year (they fashioned) the Katurvimsa day, from out of the priesthood the Abhiplava (shadaha), from out of the nobility the Prishthya (shadaha) , from out of Agni the Abhigit, from out of the waters the Svarasâman days, from out of the sun the Vishuvat,--the Svarasâman days have been told;--from out of Indra the Visvagit,--the Prishthya and Abhiplava have been told;--from out of Mitra and Varuna the Go and Âyus , from out of the Visve Devâh the Dasarâtra , from out of the regions the Prishthya-shadaha of the Dasarâtra, from out of these worlds the Khandoma days.
1	2	3	From out of the year (they fashioned) the tenth day, from out of Pragâpati the Mahâvrata, and from out of the world of heaven the Udayanîya Atirâtra:--such was the birth of the Year; and, verily, whosoever thus knows that birth of the Year becomes more (and more) glorious to (the end of) it, he becomes possessed of a (new) body, he becomes the Year, and, as the Year , he goes to the gods.
1	3	1	Now, when they are initiated they indeed offer sacrifice to the deities Agni and Vishnu: they become the deities Agni and Vishnu, and attain to fellowship and co-existence with Agni and Vishnu.
1	3	2	And when they perform the opening sacrifice they indeed offer sacrifice to the deity Aditi: they become the deity Aditi, and attain to fellowship and co-existence with Aditi.
1	3	3	And when they proceed with the buying (of Soma-plants) they indeed offer sacrifice to the deity Soma: they become the deity Soma, and attain to fellowship and co-existence with Soma.
1	3	4	And when they perform the guest-offering they indeed offer sacrifice to the deity Vishnu: they become the deity Vishnu, and attain to fellowship and co-existence with Vishnu.
1	3	5	And when they perform the Pravargya-offering  they indeed offer sacrifice to the deity Âditya: they become the deity Âditya, and attain to fellowship and co-existence with Âditya (the sun).
1	3	6	And when they enter upon the Upasads they indeed offer sacrifice to those very deities  who (receive oblations) at the Upasads: they become those deities, and attain to fellowship and co-existence with those deities.
1	3	7	And when they perform the animal sacrifice to Agni and Soma  they indeed offer sacrifice to the deities Agni and Soma: they become the deities Agni and Soma, and attain to fellowship and co-existence with Agni and Soma.
1	3	8	And when they perform the opening Atirâtra (of the sacrificial session) they indeed offer sacrifice to those deities, the Day and Night : they become those deities, the Day and Night, and attain to fellowship and co-existence with the Day and Night.
1	3	9	And when they enter upon the Katurvimsa day they indeed offer sacrifice to that deity, the Year : they become that deity, the Year, and attain to fellowship and co-existence with the Year.
1	3	10	And when they enter upon the Abhiplava-shadaha they indeed offer sacrifice to those deities, the Half-months and Months: they become those deities, the Half-months and Months, and attain to fellowship and co-existence with the Half-months and Months.
1	3	11	And when they enter upon the Prishthya-shadaha they indeed offer sacrifice to those deities, the Seasons: they become those deities, the Seasons, and attain to fellowship and co-existence with the Seasons.
1	3	12	And when they enter upon the Abhigit (day) they indeed offer sacrifice to the deity Agni: they become the deity Agni, and attain to fellowship and co-existence with Agni.
1	3	13	And when they enter upon the Svarasâman (days) they indeed offer sacrifice to that deity, the Waters: they become that deity, the Waters, and attain to fellowship and co-existence with the Waters.
1	3	14	And when they enter upon the Vishuvat (day) they indeed offer sacrifice to the deity Âditya they become the deity Âditya, and attain to fellowship and co-existence with Âditya. The Svarasâmans have been told.
1	3	15	And when they enter upon the Visvagit (day) they indeed offer sacrifice to the deity Indra: they become the deity Indra, and attain to fellowship and co-existence with Indra. The Prishthya and Abhiplava (shadahas) have been told.
1	3	16	And when they enter upon (the performance of) the Go and Âyus (stoma)  they indeed offer sacrifice to the deities Mitra and Varuna: theybecome the deities Mitra and Varuna, and attain to fellowship and co-existence with Mitra and Varuna.
1	3	17	And when they enter upon the Dasarâtra they indeed offer sacrifice to that deity the Visve Devâh: they become that deity, the Visve Devâh, and attain to fellowship and co-existence with the Visve Devâh.
1	3	18	And when they enter upon the Prishthya-shadaha of the Dasarâtra they indeed offer sacrifice to those deities, the Regions: they become those deities, the Regions, and attain to fellowship and co-existence with the Regions.
1	3	19	And when they enter upon the Khandomas they indeed offer sacrifice to those deities, these Worlds: they become those deities, these Worlds, and attain to fellowship and co-existence with these Worlds.
1	3	20	And when they enter upon the tenth day (of the Dasarâtra) they indeed offer sacrifice to that deity, the Year: they become that deity, the Year, and attain to fellowship and co-existence with the Year.
1	3	21	And when they enter upon the Mahâvrata they indeed offer sacrifice to the deity Pragâpati: they become the deity Pragâpati, and attain to fellowship and co-existence with Pragâpati.
1	3	22	And when they enter upon the concluding Atirâtra (of the sacrificial session), then, indeed, having gained the Year, they establish themselves in the world of heaven. And were any one to ask them, 'To what deity are ye offering sacrifice this day? what deity are ye? with what deity do ye dwell?' let them name of those (deities) the one to whom they may be nearest (in the performance of the Sattra). And,verily, such (sacrificers) are seated (sad) in the good  (place), for they are for ever seated among the good deities; and the others are mere partakers in the sacrificial session ; and if any one were, during a sacrificial session, to speak evil of such initiates as know this, let them say to him, 'We cut thee off from those deities;' and he becomes the worse, and they themselves become the better for it.
1	3	23	That same year contains three great rites (mahâvrata):--the great rite on the Katurvimsa day, the great rite on the Vishuvat day, and the great rite  on the Mahâvrata day itself. Now, those of old used, indeed, to enter upon (perform) that (year's session) with three great rites, and they became glorious, truth-speaking, and faithful to their vow; but if nowadays any (sattrins) were to perform it on this wise, they assuredly would crumble away even as a jar of unbaked clay would crumble away if water were poured into it. They (who do so) perform too much: that (object) of theirs is gained by truth, by toil, by fervid devotion, by faith, by sacrifice, and by oblations.
1	4	1	The Year, indeed, is Man;--the opening (prâyanîya) Atirâtra is his feet, for by means of theirfeet (men) go forward (prayanti): that part of them which is white is of the form of the day, and that which is black is (of the form) of the night; the nails are of the form of herbs and trees. The Katurvimsa day is the thighs, the Abhiplava the breast, and the Prishthya the back.
1	4	2	The Abhigit is this right arm, the Svarasâman days these three (openings of the) vital airs on the right side  the Vishuvat the head, and the (second period of) Svarasâman days these three vital airs on the left side.
1	4	3	The Visvagit is this left arm,--the Prishthya and Abhiplava have been told,--the Go and Âyus those downward vital airs; the Dasarâtra the limbs, the Mahâvrata the mouth; and the concluding (udayanîya) Atirâtra is the hands, for by means of the hands (men) move (reach) upwards (udyanti) that part of them which is white is of the form of the day, and that which is black is of that of the night; and the nails are of the form of the stars. Thus that year is established in respect of the body; and, verily, whosoever thus knows that year to be established in respect of the body, establishes himself by means of offspring and cattle in this, and by immortality in the other, world.
2	1	1	Verily, those who become initiated for (a sacrificial session of) a year cross an ocean: the Prâyanîya Atirâtra is a flight of steps , for it is by means of a flight of steps that one enters (the water); andwhen they enter on the Prâyanîya Atirâtra it is just as if they were entering the ocean by a flight of steps.
2	1	2	The Katurvimsa day is (in the form of) a foothold, a shallow place , such a one as (where the water reaches) either to the arm-pits or to the neck, whence, having rested, they enter  (the deep water). The Abhiplava is (a spot) suitable for swimming; and so is the Prishthya suitable for swimming.
2	1	3	The Abhigit is a foothold, a shallow place, such a one as (where the water reaches) either to the arm-pits, or to the neck, whence, having rested, they come out (of the water). The first Svarasâman is thigh-deep, the second knee-deep, the third knuckle-deep. The Vishuvat is a foothold (in the form of) an island. The first (Svarasâman) with reversed Sâmans is knuckle-deep, the second knee-deep, and the third thigh-deep.
2	1	4	The Visvagit is a foothold, a shallow place, such a one as (where the water reaches) either to the arm-pits or to the neck, whence, having rested, he enters (the deep water again). The Prishthya is suitable for swimming, and so is the Abhiplava, and so are the Go and Âyus, and so is the Dasarâtra.
2	1	5	The Mahâvrata is a foothold, a shallow place, such a one as (where the water reaches) either to the arm-pits or to the neck, whence, having rested,they step out (of the water). The Udayanîya (concluding) Atirâtra is a flight of steps, for it is by a flight of steps that people step out (of the water): thus, when they perform the Udayanîya Atirâtra, it is just as if, having entered the sea by a flight of steps, they were to step out of it, by a flight of steps.
2	1	6	Regarding this they say, 'How many Atirâtras are there in the year, how many Agnishtomas, how many Ukthyas, how many Shodasins, how many Shadahas?'--Two Atirâtras, a hundred and six Agnishtomas, and two hundred and forty Ukthyas,--thus in the case of those who perform the Svarasâmans as Ukthyas.
2	1	7	But in the case of those who perform them as Agnishtomas, a hundred and twelve Agnishtomas, two hundred and thirty-four Ukthyas, twelve Shodasins, and sixty Shadahas. This, then, is how the year is obtained.
2	1	8	There are twelve months in the year, and their vital energy and power are the Prishthas; and by performing the Prishthas month by month, they obtain, in monthly portions , that vital energy of the year.--'And how do they obtain the vital energy of the thirteenth (intercalary) month?' Well, subsequent to the Vishuvat day they perform the Visvagit Agnishtoma with all the Prishthas , and thus indeed they obtain the vital energy of the thirteenth month.
2	1	9	Now, concerning this, Svetaketu Âruneya,knowing this, once said, 'I am now going to get myself initiated for one year.' His father, looking at him, said, 'Knowest thou, long-lived one, the fording-footholds of the year?'--'I know them,' he replied, for, indeed, he said this as one knowing it.
2	2	1	Here, now, they say, 'Whereby are the Abhiplavas possessed of light (gyotis) on both sides ,and the Prishthya of light on one side only?' Well, the Abhiplavas are these worlds, and these worlds are indeed possessed of light on both sides--through the fire on this side, and through the sun on yonder side; and the Prishthya is the seasons, and the seasons are indeed possessed, of light on one side only: he who burns yonder (the sun) is their light.
2	2	2	Verily, those two wheels of the gods, established on the Prishthya , revolve crushing  the Sacrificer's evil; and, indeed, if during a sacrificial session any one speaks evil of such initiates as know this, those two wheels of the gods cut off his head: the (chariot-) seat is the Dasarâtra, and the two wheels are the Prishthya and Abhiplava.
2	2	3	Concerning this they say, 'Seeing that the two wheels (of a cart) are alike, and those stomas unlike, how are those stomas one after another performed alike for him?' Let him reply, 'Thereby, that there are six of the one, and six of the other.'
2	2	4	'Let him make the Prishthya and Abhiplava two warps ,' said Paiṅgya; 'let him make their Stotras and Sastras run together:' inasmuch as he makes them run together, these (channels of the) vital airs, though separate from one another, run together, with one and the same aim , into a common web; but were he not to make them run together, the Sacrificer would be liable to perish; and liable to perish, indeed, is one who is either blind or deaf.
2	2	5	The Agnishtomas amount to nine in a month ;--now, there are nine vital airs: it is the vital airs he thus lays into them (the Sacrificers); and thus they attain the full term of life, and so, indeed, they do not depart this world before the (full) term of life.
2	2	6	And the Ukthyas (amount) to twenty-one;--now, there are twelve months in the year, five seasons, and three worlds, that makes twenty, and he who burns yonder (the sun) is the twenty-first , --that consummation (he attains), and by that consummation he ascends month by month to the world of heaven, and gains, in monthly portions, the world of heaven, and the twenty-one-fold Stoma, and the Brihatî metre .
2	2	7	The Agnishtomas amount to thirty-four in a month --for the obtainment of all the gods; for there are thirty-three gods, and Pragâpati is the thirty-fourth. And there is one Ukthya with the Shodasin (stotra); for the Ukthya means food, and the Shodasin vital strength.
2	2	8	By means of that food and vital strength the gods obtained all their desires, and secured all their desires; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer); by means of that food and vital strength, obtain all his desires, and secure all his desires: with a view to that object he who is initiated for (a sacrificial session of) a year should therefore perform the Prishthya and Abhiplava (-shadahas).
2	2	9	Now, the Âdityas and the Aṅgiras, both of them sprung from Pragâpati, were contending together saying, 'We shall be the first to reach heaven,--we shall be the first!'
2	2	10	By means of four Stomas, four Prishthas , and light (simple) hymn-tunes, the Âdityas sailed across to the heavenly world; and inasmuch as they sailed (abhi-plu) to it, they (these six-days’ periods) are called Abhiplava.
2	2	11	By means of all the Stomas, all the Prishthas , and heavy (complicated) hymn-tunes, the Aṅgiras, coming after (the gods), as it were , touched (reached) the heavenly world; and inasmuch as they touched (spris) it, it (this six-days’ period) is called Prishthya .
2	2	12	It is a six-days’ Abhiplava, because it consists of six days; or a five-days’ Abhiplava, because it consists of five days, for the last day is the same as the first; or a four-days’ Abhiplava, for there are four Stomas (used) in it--the thrice-threefold (trivrit), the fifteen-versed, the seventeen-versed, and the twenty-one-versed one; or a three-days’ Abhiplava, for it is of three orders--Gyotis, Go, and Âyus ; or a two-days’ Abhiplava, for there are two Sâmans (used) in it--the Brihat and the Rathantara ; or a one-day's Abhiplava, for it is performed with the Stomas of a one-day's (Soma-sacrifice ). Twelve Stotras and twelve Sastras of the four Ukthyas are in excess --they make a seventh Agnishtoma, and thus the Agnishtomas amount to seven.
2	2	13	Now, Proti Kausâmbeya  Kausurubindi dwelt with Uddâlaka Âruni as a religious student. The teacher asked him, 'My son, how many days did thy father  consider that there are in the year?'
2	2	14	'Ten,' he replied.--'Ten, indeed,' he said; 'for the Virâg consists of ten syllables, and the sacrifice is of Virâg nature;--
2	2	15	But how many are there really?'--'Nine,' he replied.--'Nine, indeed,' he said; 'for there are nine vital airs, and by means of the vital airs the sacrifice is performed;--
2	2	16	But how many are there really?'--'Eight,' he replied.--'Eight, indeed,' he said; 'for the Gâyatrî consists of eight syllables, and the sacrifice is of Gâyatrî nature;--
2	2	17	But how many are there really?'--'Seven,' he replied.--'Seven, indeed,' he said; 'for there are seven metres (successively) increasing by four (syllables), and by means of the metres the sacrifice is performed;--
2	2	18	But how many are there really?'--'Six,' he replied.--'Six, indeed,' he said; 'six seasons make up a year, and the sacrifice is the year; and one and the same day are those two, the opening and concluding (Atirâtra );--
2	2	19	But how many are there really?'--'Five,' he replied.--'Five, indeed,' he said; 'the sacrifice is fivefold; the sacrificial animal is fivefold ; there are five seasons in the year, and the sacrifice is the year;and one and the same day are those two, the Katurvimsa and the Mahâvrata.;--
2	2	20	But how many are there really?'--'Four,' he replied.--'Four, indeed,' he said; 'animals are four-footed, and animals constitute a sacrifice; and one and the same day are those two, the Prishthya and Abhiplava;--
2	2	21	But how many are there really?'--'Three,' he replied.--'Three, indeed,' he said; 'there are three metres, three worlds; and the (Soma-) sacrifice consists of three services; and one and the same day are those two, the Abhigit and Visvagit;--
2	2	22	But how many are there really?'--'Two,' he replied.--'Two, indeed,' he said; 'for man is two-footed, and the sacrifice is man; and one and the same day are the Svarasâmans;--
2	2	23	But how many are there really?'--'One,' he replied.--'A day, indeed,' he said; 'the whole year is just that day after day:'--this is the mystic import of the year; and, verily, whosoever thus knows this mystic import  of the year grows more (and more) glorious up to (the end of) it; he becomes possessed of a (new) body, he becomes the year, and in the shape of the year he joins the gods.
2	3	1	That year, doubtless, amounts to a Brihatî--,there are two shadahas  of winning days  ; thetwo, Prishthya and Abhiplava ; the Go and Âyus, and the Dasarâtra (ten days)--that makes thirty-six; for the Brihatî consists of thirty-six syllables, and by means of the Brihatî the gods strove to reach heaven, and by the Brihatî they did gain heaven; and in like manner does this one, by means of the Brihatî, now strive to reach heaven, and thereby gain heaven; he who knows this secures for himself whatever wish there is in the Brihatî.
2	3	2	And as to the Katurvimsa day, it is the same as either the seventh or the ninth (day) of the Dasarâtra  From out of the Abhiplava the Prishthya is formed, from the Prishthya the Abhigit,from the Abhigit the Svarasâmans, from the Svarasâmans the Vishuvat, from the Vishuvat the Svarasâmans, from the Svarasâmans the Visvagit, from the Visvagit the Prishthya , from the Prishthya the Abhiplava, from the Abhiplava the Go and Âyus, and from the Go and Âyus the Dasarâtra.
2	3	3	And that Mahâvrata is a winning-day, for its Stoma is the Pañkavimsa, and a metre does not collapse from (excess or deficiency of) a syllable--neither from one nor from two (syllables); neither does a Stoma by (an excess of) one hymn-verse .
2	3	4	Prior to the Vishuvat they perform first the Abhiplava, and afterwards the Prishthya, for the Abhiplava represents the sons, and the Prishthya the father; whence in early life the sons subsist on (the resources of) their father. Subsequent to the Vishuvat they perform first the Prishthya, and afterwards the Abhiplava; whence in later life the father subsists on (the resources of) his sons; and, verily, the sons of him who thus knows this subsist on him in early life, and he subsists on his sons in later life.
2	3	5	Here, now, they ask, 'If he were to die after entering on the Katurvimsa day, how does he become one who has not merely (uttered) the Âgur-formula ?' Let him say, 'In that they then perform the Opening Atirâtra, thereby (he becomes such a one).'
2	3	6	As to this they ask, 'Seeing that there are the twelve months of the year, and that one day, to wit, the Vishuvat, is in excess, does this belong to those (months) that go before or to those that follow?' Let him say, 'Both to those that go before and to those that follow;' for the Vishuvat is the body (trunk) of the year, and the months are its limbs; and where the body is there are (or, that includes) also the limbs, and where the limbs are there is also the body; and neither is the body in excess of the limbs, nor are the limbs in excess of the body: and thus, indeed, that (day) belongs both to those (months) that go before and to those that follow.
2	3	7	But, indeed, that year is a great eagle: the six months which they perform prior to the Vishuvat are the one wing, and those which they perform subsequent thereto are the other; and the Vishuvat is the body; and, indeed, where the body is there are also the wings, and where the wings are there is also the body; for neither is the body in excess of the wings, nor are the wings in excess of the body: and thus, indeed, that (day) belongs both to those (months) that go before and to those that follow.
2	3	8	As to this they ask, 'Seeing that for six months prior to the Vishuvat they- perform Stomas tending upwards, and for six (months) reversed (Stomas), how are these latter performed so as to tend upwards?' Let him say, 'In that they perform that Dasarâtra as one with upward tending Stomas, thereby they do so.' Now, the Mahâvrata did not yield itself to the gods saying, 'How is it, ye have performed the Vishuvat with upward tending hymns, and me with reversed ones?'
2	3	9	The gods said, 'Try ye to find out that sacrificial performance which has upward tending Stomas, and whereby we may gain this.' They saw that Dasarâtra with upward tending Stomas after the manner of the year: what Prishthya-shadaha there is in it that is the seasons, the (three) Khandomas are these worlds, and the tenth day is the year. Thereby they gained this (Mahâvrata), and it yielded itself to them; and, verily, the Mahâvrata yields itself to him who so knows this.
2	3	10	And in this way, indeed, there is an ascent of days:--by means of the Opening Atirâtra they ascend the concluding Atirâtra, by means of the Katurvimsa the Mahâvrata, by means of an Abhiplava a subsequent Abhiplava, by means of a Prishthya a subsequent Prishthya, by means of the Abhigit the Visvagit, by means of the Svarasâmans the subsequent Svarasâmans--but that one day is not ascended, to wit, the Vishuvat: and, verily, he who thus knows this ascends to (the state of) one more glorious, and no one inferior to him ascends (to be equal) to him.
2	3	11	And in this way, indeed, there is a descent of days:--the Prâyanîya Atirâtra descends to the Katurvimsa day, the Katurvimsa day to the Abhiplava, the Abhiplava to the Prishthya, the Prishthya to the Abhigit, the Abhigit to the Svarasâmans, the Svarasâmans to the Vishuvat, the Vishuvat to the Svarasâmans, the Svarasâmans to the Visvagit, the Visvagit to the Prishthya, the Prishthya to the Abhiplava, the Abhiplava to the Go and Âyus, the Go and Âyus to the Dasarâtra, the Dasarâtra to the Mahâvrata, the Mahâvrata to the Udayanîya Atirâtra, the Udayanîya Atirâtra to the world of heaven, to the resting-place, to plenty.
2	3	12	Such, indeed, are the wilds and ravines of sacrifice, and they (take) hundreds upon hundreds of days’ carriage-drives; and if any venture into them without knowledge, then hunger or thirst, evil-doers and fiends harass them, even as fiends would harass foolish men wandering in a wild forest; but if those who know this do so, they pass from one duty to another, as from one stream into another, and from one safe place to another, and obtain well-being, the world of heaven.
2	3	13	As to this they say, 'How many onward, and how many backward days are there?' Well, those which are performed once each are onward days, and those which are performed repeatedly are backward days: let him at least consider these  as backward ones, for in accordance with the course of the Shadahas he himself moves.
2	4	1	The Year, indeed, is Man;--the Prâyanîya Atirâtra is his breath, for by means of the breath men go forward (prayanti); and the Ârambhanîya (opening) day  is speech, for by means of speech men undertake (ârabh) whatever they do undertake.
2	4	2	The Abhiplava-shadaha is this right hand . This (little finger) is the first day thereof,--this (upper joint )is its morning-service, this (middle joint) its midday-service, and this (lower joint) its evening-service: it is in place of the Gâyatrî, whence this (little finger) is the shortest of these (fingers).
2	4	3	This (third finger) is the second day,--this (upper joint) is its morning-service, this (middle joint) its midday-service, and this (lower joint) its evening-service: it is in place of the Trishtubh, whence this (third finger) is larger than this (little finger).
2	4	4	This (middle finger) is the third day,--this is its morning-service, this its midday-service, and this its evening-service: it is in place of the Gagatî, whence this is the largest of these (fingers).
2	4	5	This (fore-finger) is the fourth day,--this is its morning-service, this its midday-service, and this its evening-service: it is in place of the Virâg; for the Virâg is food, whence this (fore-finger) is the most food-eating  of these (fingers).
2	4	6	This (thumb) is the fifth day,--this is its morning-service, this its midday-service, and this its evening-service: it is in place of the Paṅkti, for the Paṅkti is broad , as it were, whence this (thumb) is the broadest of these (fingers).
2	4	7	This (right arm) is the sixth day,--this (forearm ) is its morning-service, this (upper arm) its midday-service, and this (shoulder-blade) its evening-service: it is in place of the Atikhandas, whence this (arm) is larger than those (fingers). That day is a Gâyatrî one, whence this shoulder-blade is the shortest: this Abhiplava-shadaha (extends) in this, in this, in this, and in this, direction ; and the Prishthya is the body (trunk).
2	4	8	Now, as to this, Paiṅgya, knowing this, said, The Abhiplavas leap about (plavante), as it were, and the Prishthya stands (sthâ) , as it were; forthis (man) leaps about, as it were, with his limbs, and he stands, as it were, with his body.'
2	4	9	The Trivrit (stoma) is its head, whence that (head) is threefold (trivrit)--skin, bone, and brain.
2	4	10	The Pañkadasa (fifteen-versed hymn-form) is the neck-joints,--for there are fourteen of these (joints) , and the vital force is the fifteenth; hence by means of that (neck), though being small, man bears a heavy burden: therefore the Pañkadasa is the neck.
2	4	11	The Saptadasa (seventeen-versed hymn-form) is the chest; for there are eight 'gatru ' on the oneside, and eight on the other, and the chest itself is the seventeenth: therefore the Saptadasa (stoma) is the chest.
2	4	12	The Ekavimsa (twenty-one-versed hymn-form) is the belly, for inside the belly there are twenty 'kuntâpa ,' and the belly is the twenty-first: therefore the Ekavimsa (stoma) is the belly.
2	4	13	The Trinava (thrice nine-versed hymn-form) is the two sides (pârsva);--there are thirteen ribs (parsu) on the one side, and thirteen on the other , and the sides make up the thrice ninth: therefore the Trinava (stoma) is the two sides.
2	4	14	The Trayastrimsa (thirty-three-versed hymn-form)is the spine; for there are thirty-two 'karûkara ' of that (spine), and the spine itself is the thirty-third: therefore the Trayastrimsa (stoma) is the spine.
2	4	15	The Abhigit is the same as this right ear; the first Svarasâman is this white part of the eye, the second the black part, and the third the pupil; the Vishuvat is the nose, the first backward Svarasâman is this pupil of the eye, the second the black, and the third the white part thereof.
2	4	16	The Visvagit is the same as this left ear; the Prishthya and Abhiplava have been told; the Go and Âyus are the two downward breathings which there are (in the body); the Dasarâtra the limbs, the Mahâvrata is the mouth; and the Udayanîya Atirâtra the up-breathing, for by means of the up-breathing men go upwards (ud-yanti): such is that year as established in the body; and, verily, whosoever thus knows that year as established in the body, establishes himself by offspring and cattle in this, and by immortality in the other, world.
3	1	1	'Seeing that all this threefold universe keeps passing into one another, O Bâlâki, how is it thatthese,--to wit, the sacrifice, Man, and Pragâpati,--do not exceed one another?
3	1	2	Seeing that the upward Stomas follow the sacrifice, fitting themselves by repetitions with Sâmans, how do they enter man, and how do they become united with the vital airs?
3	1	3	The Prâyanîya Atirâtra, the Katurvimsa day, the four Abhiplavas, and the Prishthya (shadaha):how do these enter man, and how do they become united with the vital airs?
3	1	4	Fitted out with the Abhigit, the Svarasâmans join the Vishuvat on both sides:--how do these enter man, and how do they become united with the vital airs?
3	1	5	Setting out with the Trivrit, fitted out with the (Pañkadasa and) Saptadasa, and ending with the Trayastrimsa; with (the series of stomas increasing) successively by four (syllables ):--how do these enter man, and how do they become united with the vital airs?'
3	1	6	The Trivrit is his head, the Pañkadasa his neck; and the chest, they say, corresponds to the Saptadasa; the Ekavimsa they make the belly, andthe two sides, by means of the Trinava, correspond to the ribs.
3	1	7	The Abhiplavas on both sides (of the Vishuvat) are his arms, the Prishthya is the back,--so say the wise; and his spine the Brâhmanas fashion in the year by means of the (series of stomas increasing) successively by four (syllables).
3	1	8	The Abhigit and Visvagit are his ears; and his eyes, they say, correspond to the Svarasâmans; the Vishuvat, they say, is the breath of the nostrils; and the Go and Âyus are those two downward breathings.
3	1	9	The Dasarâtra they call his limbs, and the Mahâvrata the Brâhmanas fashion (arrange) so as to be the mouth in the year ;--the Supreme Self has entered into that year endowed with all stomas and with all sâmans: having fashioned him alike with the body, the sage is seated free from pain  on the heights of the ruddy one (the sun).
3	2	1	The Year is Man :--'Man' is one unit, and 'year' is another, and these now are one and the same;--there are in the year the two, day and night, and in man there are these two breathings, and these now are one and the same;--there are three seasons in the year, and these three breathings in man, and these (two) now are one and the same;--'samvatsara (year)' consists of four syllables, and so does 'yagamâna (sacrificer),' and these (two) now are one and the same;--there are five seasons in the year, and these five breathings in man, and these (two) now are one and the same;--there are six seasons in the year, and these six breathings in man, and these (two) now are one and the same;--there are seven seasons in the year, and these seven breathings in man, and these (two) now are one and the same.
3	2	2	There are twelve months in the year, and these twelve breathings in man, and these (two) now are one and the same;--there are thirteen months in the (leap-) year, and these thirteen (channels of) breathings in man, the navel being the thirteenth, and these (two) now are one and the same;--there are twenty-four half-months in the year, and this man is twenty-four-fold, being possessed of twenty fingers and toes and four limbs; and. these (two) now are one and the same;--there are twenty-six half-months in the (leap-) year, and this man is twenty-six-fold, the two feet making up the twenty-six; and these (two) now are one and the same.
3	2	3	And there are three hundred and sixty nightsin the year, and three hundred and sixty bones in man, and these (two) now are one and the same;--there are three hundred and sixty days in the year, and three hundred and sixty parts of marrow in man, and these (two) now are one and the same.
3	2	4	And there are seven hundred and twenty days and nights in the year, and seven hundred and twenty bones and parts of marrow in man, and these (two) now are one and the same.
3	2	5	And there are ten thousand and eight hundred 'muhûrta' in the year; and fifteen times as many 'kshipras' as there are 'muhûrta'; and fifteen times as many 'etarhi' as there are 'kshipra;' and fifteen times as many 'idâni' as there are 'etarhi'; and fifteen times as many breathings as there are 'idâni'; and as many spirations as there are breathings ; and as many twinklings of the eye as there are spirations, and as many hair-pits as there are twinklings of the eye, and as many sweat-pores as there are hair-pits; and as many sweat-pores as there are so many drops it rains.
3	2	6	Concerning this, Vârkali, knowing this, once said, 'I know the raining cloud extending over the whole earth, and the drops of that rain.'
3	2	7	It is with reference thereto that this verse is told,--Whilst whirling round, be it standing, or sitting, or even sleeping, how often does man, otherwise than from toil, breathe and expel the air regularly  by day and night?
3	2	8	And in answer thereto this verse is told,-- Inasmuch as man is what is measured a hundred hundred and eight hundred, therefore they say:--so often does man regularly  breathe and expel the air by day and night.
3	3	1	The gods were once performing the initiation ceremony for a (sacrificial session) of a thousand years. When five hundred years had passed with them, everything here was worn out--to wit, Stomas, and Prishthas, and metres (texts).
3	3	2	The gods then perceived that unexhausted element of the sacrifice, and by means of that unexhausted element they obtained what success there was in the Veda; and, verily, for him who thus knows this, the Vedas are unexhausted, and the work of the officiating priests is pet-formed with the unexhausted threefold science.
3	3	3	Now, this is that unexhausted element of the sacrifice:--o-srâvaya, astu sraushat, yaga, ye yagâmahe, and vaushat . In these five utterances there are seventeen syllables:--o-srâvaya consists of four syllables, astu sraushat of four syllables, yaga of two syllables, ye yagâmahe of five syllables;
3	3	4	And the Vashat-call consists of two syllables. This is the seventeenfold Pragâpati, as established in the deity and in the body, and, verily, whosoever thus knows that seventeenfold Pragâpati, as established in the deity and in the body, establishes himself by offspring and cattle in this, and by immortality in the other, world.
3	3	5	The gods then spake, 'Find ye out that sacrificial performance which shall be a substitute for one of a thousand years; for what man is equal thereto that he could get through with (a performance of) a thousand years?'
3	3	6	They saw the Visvagit with all the Prishthas  to be an accelerated Soma-feast in lien of the Prishthya-shadaha, for there are those (same) Stomas, those Prishthas, and those metres.
3	3	7	They saw the Prishthya-shadaha to be an accelerated Soma-feast in lieu of the Dvâdasâha, for there are those (same) Stomas, those Prishthas, and those metres .
3	3	8	They saw the Dvâdasâha to be an accelerated Soma-feast in lieu of (a session of) a year , for there are those (same) Stomas, those Prishthas, and those metres.
3	3	9	They saw the (session of a) year to be an accelerated Soma-feast in lieu of the Tâpaskita , for there are those (same) Stomas, those Prishthas, and those metres.
3	3	10	They saw the Tâpaskita to be an accelerated Soma-feast in lieu of the thousand years’ performance, for there are those (same) Stomas, those Prishthas, and those metres.
3	3	11	He passes a year with the rites of initiation,a year with the Upasads, and a year with the pressings of Soma.
3	3	12	When he passes a year with the rites of initiation he thereby secures for himself the first part of the performance of a thousand years; and when he passes a year with the Upasads he thereby secures for himself the central part of the performance of a thousand years; and when he passes a year with the pressings he thereby secures for himself the last part of the performance of a thousand years.
3	3	13	Twelve months he passes with the rites of initiation, twelve with the Upasads, and twelve with the pressings,--that makes thirty-six. Now the Brihatî (metre) consists of thirty-six syllables, and by means of the Brihatî the gods strove to reach heaven, and by means of the Brihatî they indeed attained heaven; and in like manner does this one, by means of the Brihatî, now strive to reach heaven, and by means of the Brihatî he indeed attains heaven; and whatever object of desire there is in the Brihatî, that he thereby secures for himself.
3	3	14	But, indeed, there is that triad that is performed together,--the Agni (fire-altar), the Arkya, and the Mahad Uktham (great litany). When he passes a year with the rites of initiation, and a year with the Upasads, thereby the Agni and the Arka are secured by him; and when he passes a year with the pressings, thereby the Mahad Uktham is secured by him: this, then, to wit, the Tâpaskita, is the substitute for the performance of a thousand years, and this, to wit, the Tâpaskita, conduces to the procreation of creatures.
3	4	1	Pragâpati once upon a time spake unto Purusha Nârâyana, 'Offer sacrifice! offer sacrifice!' He spake, 'Verily, thou sayest to me, "Offer sacrifice! offer sacrifice!" and thrice have I offered sacrifice: by the morning-service the Vasus went forth, by the midday-service the Rudras, and by the evening-service the Âdityas; now I have but the offering-place , and on the offering-place I am sitting.'
3	4	2	He spake, 'Offer yet sacrifice! I will tell thee such a thing that thy hymns shall be strung as a pearl on a thread, or a thread through a pearl.'
3	4	3	And he spake thus unto him, ‘At the (chanting of the) Bahishpavamâna, at the morning-service, thou shalt hold on to the Udgâtri from behind, saying, "Thou art a falcon formed of the Gâyatrî metre,--I hold on to thee: bear me unto well-being!"
3	4	4	‘And at the midday Pavamâna thou shalt hold on to the Udgâtri from behind, saying, "Thou art an eagle formed of the Trishtubh metre,--I hold on to thee: bear me unto well-being! "
3	4	5	‘And at the Ârbhava-pavamâna, at the evening-service, thou shalt hold on to the Udgâtri from behind, saying, "Thou art a Ribhu formed of the Gagat metre,--I hold on to thee: bear me unto well-being!"
3	4	6	'And at the close of each pressing thou shalt mutter, "In me be light, in me might, in me glory, in me everything!"'
3	4	7	Now light, indeed, is this (terrestrial) world, might the air-world, glory the heavens, and what other worlds there are, they are everything (else).
3	4	8	And light, indeed, is Agni, might Vâyu (thewind), glory Âditya (the sun), and what other gods there are they are everything.
3	4	9	And light, indeed, is the Rig-veda, might the Yagur-vela, glory the Sâma-veda, and what other Vedas there are they are everything.
3	4	10	And light, indeed, is speech, might the breath, glory the eye, and what other vital airs there are they are everything.
3	4	11	Let him know this:--'All the worlds have I placed within mine own self, and mine own self have I placed within all the worlds; all the gods have I placed within mine own self, and mine own self have I placed within all the gods; all the Vedas have I placed within mine own self, and mine own self have I placed within all the Vedas; all the vital airs have I placed within mine own self, and mine own self have I placed within the vital airs.' For imperishable, indeed, are the worlds, imperishable the gods, imperishable the Vedas, imperishable the vital airs, imperishable is the All: and, verily, whosoever thus knows this, passes from the imperishable unto the imperishable, conquers recurrent death, and attains the full measure of life.
3	5	1	Of old, indeed, they were wont to seize this victim as one dedicated to Savitri, but now they seize it as one dedicated to Pragâpati, saying, 'Savitri, in truth, is the same as Pragâpati.' It is therefore after having thrown together the (sacrificial) fires that they ought to perform this (animal) sacrifice on the Grihapati's own fires, thinking, 'May we also have a share in this tail (of the. victim) wherewith they are now making offering together to the wives (of the gods).' They then perform the initiation ceremony whenever they choose.
3	5	2	Here now they say, 'They ought to have separate hearths; and if one of the initiates were to be taken ill let him stay aside offering the Agnihotra. If he gets well again, they bring (the fires) together and invite him to join them; but if he dies they burn him by his own (three) fires  without an (ordinary) fire for (burning) a dead body; and the other sacrificers sit (through the sacrificial session);--such at least is the performance in the case of one who keeps up his sacrificial fires; but, indeed, they have their hearths in common: the theological explication of this is the same as in regard to the preparatory ceremonial .'
3	5	3	They also say, 'Seeing that the performers of a year's session become initiated for a year, how does their Agnihotra come to be uninterrupted?' Let him reply, 'By the fast-milk.'
3	5	4	They also say, 'Seeing that the performers of a year's session become initiated for a year, how does their Full-moon oblation come to be uninterrupted?' Let him reply, 'By the ghee and the sacrificial cake.'
3	5	5	They also say, 'Seeing that the performers of a year's session become initiated for a year, how does their New-moon oblation come to be uninterrupted?' Let him reply, 'By the sour curds and the cake.'
3	5	6	They also say, 'Seeing that the performers of a year's session become initiated for a year, how does their offering to the Fathers come to be uninterrupted?' Let him reply,' By the Aupâsana (rites ).'
3	5	7	They also say, 'Seeing that the performers of a year's session become initiated for a year, how does their offering of firstfruits come to be uninterrupted?' Let him reply, 'By Soma's pap .'
3	5	8	They also say, 'Seeing that the performers of a year's session become initiated for a year, how do their seasonal offerings come to be uninterrupted?' Let him reply, 'By the Payasyâ .'
3	5	9	They also say, 'Seeing that the performers of a year's session become initiated for a year, how does their animal sacrifice come to be uninterrupted?' Let him reply, 'By the animal and the cake .'
3	5	10	They also say, 'Seeing that the performers of a year's session become initiated for a year, howdoes their Soma come to be uninterrupted?' Let him reply, 'By the Soma-pressings.'
3	5	11	It is thus that these sacrificial rites enter into the year; and, verily, whosoever thus knows this entering of the sacrificial rites into the year becomes a sharer in the heavenly world.
3	5	12	In the year there should be known to be uniformity:--one Atirâtra they perform before, and one after, the Vishuvat; fifty three Agnishtomas they perform before, and fifty-three after, the Vishuvat; one hundred and twenty Ukthya days they perform before, and one hundred and twenty after, the Vishuvat,--thus at least in the case of those who perform the Svarasâmans as Ukthyas.
3	5	13	And in the case of those who (perform them) as Agnishtomas, they perform fifty-six Agnishtomas before, and fifty-six after, the Vishuvat; one hundred and seventeen Ukthya days they perform before, and one hundred and seventeen after, the Vishuvat; six Shodasins they perform before, and six after, the Vishuvat; thirty Shadahas  they perform before, and thirty after, the Vishuvat:--such, then, is the uniformity of that (year), and, verily, he who thus knows this goes through a course of sacrificial performance which is uniform, and not ineffectual, neither defective nor redundant.
4	1	1	Verily, they who perform an Agnihotra enter upon a long sacrificial session:--the Agnihotra, indeed, is a sacrificial session ensuring death in old age , for people are set free from it either by old age or by death.
4	1	2	Here, now, they say, 'If either a team (yukta) were to drive through, or people were to walk to and fro, between the two fires of such a one performing an Agnihotra, and (being thus) a performer of a long session, what rite and what expiation would there be in that case?' He may, indeed, perform an expiation, and also offer an ishti; but let him disregard it, for he who lays down his two fires doubtless spreads himself all over these worlds.
4	1	3	His Gârhapatya is this (terrestrial) world, his Anvâhâryapakana (or southern fire) the air-world, and his Âhavanîya yonder (heavenly) world; and freely, indeed, birds, both combined (yukta) and single, pass to and fro in these worlds; and even if a whole crowd were to pass through between his fires, let him know that no harm and no hurt will come to him.
4	1	4	'But, surely, there are three unclean animals, a vicious boar, a vicious ram  and a dog: if anyone of these runs about between (the fires) whilst the Agnihotra-offering is put on (the fire), what rite and what expiation would there be in that case?' Well, some poke out the ashes from the Gârhapatya, and keep throwing it down from the Âhavanîya, with this verse , 'Here Vishnu strode ,' saying, 'Vishnu is the sacrifice: by the sacrifice we thus continue the sacrifice, and with ashes we bestrew its track.' But let him not do it in this way, for if, in that case, any one were to say of him, 'Surely this (priest) has scattered about  the Sacrificer's ashes: he will soon scatter his last ashes, the chief's household will be wailing,' then that would indeed be likely to come to pass.
4	1	5	Let him proceed in this way:--Having taken either a bowl of water, or a pot of water, let him go on pouring it out from in front of the Gârhapatya up to the Âhavanîya, with this verse, 'Here Vishnu strode;' for Vishnu being the sacrifice, he thus continues the sacrifice by the sacrifice; and whatever is injured or unpropitiated in the sacrifice, for all that the water is the means of propitiation, and by water, as a means of propitiation, he thus propitiates it. Such, then, is the rite performed in that case.
4	1	6	They also say, 'If any one's Agnihotra (milk) were to be spilled whilst he gets it milked, what rite and what expiation would there be in thatcase?' Having touched (the spilled milk) with the (formula of) expiation for spilling, and poured water on it, let him make offering with what (milk) is left. But if the bowl were to be turned upside down, or if it were to break, let him touch (the spilled milk) with the (formula of) expiation, and, having poured water on it, let him make offering with what other (milk) he can procure.
4	1	7	Now, in case there should be a spilling (of milk), let him touch it with, 'It hath been shed, it hath been implanted: birth hath ensued;' for when (seed) is shed then it is implanted; and when it is implanted then birth takes place. And, indeed, this (earth) is a womb, and the milk is seed: he thus implants seed in that womb, and forthwith that shed seed of him who so knows this is born forth. And, indeed, it rains from yonder sky, and herbs and trees are produced here on earth; and seed flows from man and animals, and therefrom everything here is generated: let him therefore know that abundant production has accrued unto him, that he will be multiplied in offspring and cattle, and that he will become more prosperous.
4	1	8	And in case there should be a breaking (of the vessel), let him pour out a bowlful or potful of water, and, indeed, whatever is injured or unpropitiated in the sacrifice, for all that water is the means of propitiation, and by water, as a means of propitiation, he thus propitiates it. He does so with these utterances, 'Bhûr bhuvah svar (earth, air, sky);' for these utterances are all-expiatory :he thus makes expiation with all this (universe). Having collected the potsherds let him throw them to where the ashes have been removed. This, then, is the rite performed in that case.
4	1	9	They also say, 'If any one's Agnihotra-cow were to lie down whilst being milked, what rite and what expiation would there be in that case?' Well, some make her get up by means of the Yagus-formula, 'The divine Aditi hath risen,'--Aditi, doubtless, is this (earth):--thus saying, 'It is this (earth) we thus raise for him;'--'life hath she bestowed upon the lord of sacrifice,' thereby saying,--'It is life we thus bestow upon this (Sacrificer);--'giving unto Indra his share,' thereby saying, 'It is Indra's power we thus bestow upon him;'--'and unto Mitra and Varuna,'--Mitra and Varuna, doubtless, are the in-breathing and the up-breathing:--thus saying, 'It is the in and up-breathing we thus bestow upon him.' At this offering he should present that (cow) to a Brâhmana whom he does not intend to visit --(thus they enjoin) saying, 'It was, indeed, after perceiving the Sacrificer's suffering and evil that she lay down: we thus fasten the suffering and evil on this (Brâhmana) .'
4	1	10	But on this point Yâgñavalkya said, 'Surely, the cow turns from them as from faithless ones, and they smite the offering with trouble; let him rather do it in this way:--Let him make her get up by pushing her with a staff.' And, indeed, as in the case of one driving about here, Ibis horse, or his mule, or his ox yoked (to the car) might become weary, and, by its being urged forward by means of a staff or a goad, he completes the way he wishes to accomplish, even so does he, by that (cow) being urged forward by means of a staff or a goad, attain that heavenly world which he desires to reach.
4	1	11	And Âruni, indeed, said, 'His Agnihotra-cow, assuredly, is the sky, her calf is that blowing (wind), and the Agnihotra-vessel is this (earth). And, verily, the Agnihotra-cow of him who knows this does not perish, for how could yonder (sky) perish? Neither does the calf of the Agnihotra-cow of him who knows this perish, for how could that (wind) perish? Nor does the Agnihotra-vessel of him who knows this break to pieces, for how could this (earth) break to pieces? The rain-cloud showers down blessings: let him therefore think, "Unable to bear my glory and greatness, she (the Agnihotra-cow) has lain down: I shall become more glorious." Let him keep her for himself : he thereby takes glory (prosperity) to himself,'--thus spake Âruni. This, then, is the rite performed in that case.
4	1	12	They also say, 'If any one's Agnihotra-cow were to low whilst he gets it milked, what rite andwhat expiation would there be in that case?' Let him pluck a bunch of grass and make her eat thereof. This is the rite performed in that case.
4	2	1	They also say, 'If any one's Agnihotra-cow were to milk blood, what rite and what expiation would there be in that case?' Let him say 'Disperse!' and having made a stirring-spoon, let him order the Anvâhârya-pakana fire to be enclosed; and having boiled that (blood) thereon, let him silently offer it in an undefined (indistinct) way , for Pragâpati is undefined, and the Agnihotra is sacred to Pragâpati; and the undefined also means everything: he thus makes atonement with everything. At this offering he should give that (cow) to a Brâhmana whom he does not intend to visit; for, indeed, she who milks blood milks it after perceiving the Sacrificer's suffering and evil: he thus fastens that suffering and evil upon this (Brâhmana). Let him then make offering with what other milk he can procure: by that which is not unsound he thus throws out what is unsound in the sacrifice. This, then, is the rite performed in that case.
4	2	2	They also say, 'If any one's Agnihotra-milk were to become impure  whilst being milked, what rite and what expiation would there be in that case?' Now some think that it should be offered (arguing that) it is ready (for offering), and it would be improper if it were not offered; and that the gods have no loathing for anything. But the gods have indeed loathings:--let him rather proceed in the following way. Having shifted some hot cinders from the Gârhapatya, let him silently pour that (milk) on these hot cinders. He then pours water thereon, and thus secures (âp) it by means of the water (âp). Let him then make offering with what other (milk) he can procure. This, then, is the rite performed in that case.
4	2	3	They also say, 'If any one's Agnihotra-milk were to become impure after he has had it milked, what rite and what expiation would there be in that case?' Let him shift back the coals which were shifted away (from the fire) and on which he was going to put (the Agnihotra-milk); and let him then pour it silently on these hot cinders. He then pours water thereon, and secures it by means of the water. Let him then make offering with what other (milk) he can procure.
4	2	4	They also say, 'If any one's Agnihotra-milk were to become impure after being put on the fire, what rite and what expiation would there be in that case?' Let him offer it silently on the coals which were shifted away (from the fire), and on which it had been placed: thus it is both offered and not offered; for inasmuch as he offers it on those (hot coals) it is offered, and inasmuch as he extinguishes it along with them it is not offered. He pours water thereon, and secures it by means of the water. Let him then make offering with what other (milk) he can procure.
4	2	5	They also say, 'If the Sacrificer were to diewhen the Agnihotra-milk has been put on the fire, what rite and what expiation would there be in that case?' Having enclosed it, let him pour it out: and such, indeed, they say, is the expiation (in that case) for every Haviryagña. This, then, is the rite performed in that case.
4	2	6	They also say, 'If any one's Agnihotra-milk were to be spilled after being ladled out into the offering-spoon, what rite and what expiation would there be in that case?' Let him touch it with the (formula of) atonement for spilling, and, having poured water thereon, let him make offering with what (milk) there is left. And if the spoon be turned upside down, or if it were to break, let him touch (the spilled milk) with the (formula of) atonement for spilling, and, having poured water thereon, let him make offering with what (milk) is left in the pot.
4	2	7	Now some go back (to the Gârhapatya) and make offering with what (milk) is left in the pot; but let him not do this, for, indeed, that Agnihotra is conducive to heaven, and if any one, in that case, were to say of him, 'Surely, this one has descended again from the heavenly world: this (offering) will be in no wise conducive to heaven for him,' then that would indeed be likely to come to pass.
4	2	8	Let him rather do it in this way:--let him sit down there and then, and let them ladle out and bring to him what (milk) there is left in the pot. Now some perplex him, saying, 'Surely, this (milk) is the remainder of an offering; surely, this is exhausted: offering should not be made thereof;' but let him give no heed to this; for, surely, when that (milk) is of unexhausted strength it is used forcurdling the offering-material : let them therefore ladle out and bring to him what (milk) there is left in the pot; and if there should not be any in it, let him put on the fire what other (milk) he can procure; and when he has made the light fall on it , and poured water to it, and taken it off (the fire),--then on that (former) occasion  he (the Adhvaryu) says, 'I will ladle out ;' but on the present occasion let them ladle it out in the way it is (there) ladled out and bring it to him; and let him by all means make offering therewith. This, then, is the rite performed in that case.
4	2	9	They also say, 'If any one's Agnihotra-milk were to become impure after it has been ladled into the offering-spoon, what rite and what expiation would there be in that case?' Now some think it should be offered, on the ground that it is ready (for offering), and it would be improper if it were not offered, for the gods have no loathing for anything. And some fill it to overflowing and let it flow off ; but let him not do this; for if, in that case, any one were to say of him, 'Surely, this (priest) has poured away the Agnihotra: this Sacrificer will be poured away,' then that would indeed be likely to come to pass. Let him rather do it in this way:--let him putfuel on the Âhavanîya, and, having shifted some hot cinders away from the Âhavanîya, let him silently pour it on these hot cinders. He then pours water on it, and secures it by means of the water; and let him then make offering with what other (milk) he can procure. This, then, is the rite performed in that case.
4	2	10	They also say, 'If it were to rain upon (uparishtât) any one's Agnihotra-milk when it has been ladled into the offering-spoon, what rite and what expiation would there be in that case?' Let him know, 'Light (or sap) has come to me from above (uparishtât); the gods have helped me: I shall become more glorious;' and let him by all means make offering therewith. This, then, is the rite performed in that case.
4	3	1	They also say, 'If the fire were to go out after the first libation has been offered, what rite and what expiation would there be in that case?' Having thrown down (on the fire-place) any log of wood he may find lying near by , let him offer thereon, saying, 'In every (piece of) wood there is a fire,' for, indeed, there is a fire in every (piece of) wood. But if his heart should at all misgive him, he may offer upon gold; for gold, doubtless, is Agni's seed; and the father is the same as the son, and the son is the same as the father: he may therefore offer upon gold. This, then, is the rite performed in that case.
4	3	2	They also say, 'If, after being taken out (from the Gârhapatya), the Âhavanîya were to go outbefore the Agnihotra (has been offered), what rite and what expiation would there be in that case?' Let him take it out (again) from the Gârhapatya (and bring it) forward, and, having laid it down (on the Âhavanîya hearth), let him offer the Agnihotra thereon. And were it to go out again and again, after being taken out even a hundred times, let him take it out (again) from the Gârhapatya, and, having laid it down, let him offer the Agnihotra thereon. This, then, is the rite performed in that case.
4	3	3	They also say, 'If the Gârhapatya were to go out, what rite and what expiation would there be in that case?' Well, some churn it out from a firebrand, saying, 'Whereby man's (body) is destroyed in the end, it is therefrom he desires the expiation of this (mishap).' Let him, however, not do this; but let them proceed by taking either a firebrand, or a piece from a firebrand;--let him do it in this way:--having taken a coal from a firebrand, let him crumble it on the two churning-sticks, for (in this way) he obtains both that desire which is contained in the (fire) churned out of a firebrand, and that which is contained in (the fire churned out from) the churning-sticks. This, then, is the rite performed in that case.
4	3	4	They also say, 'If they take out fire for any one and put it with (the burning Âhavanîya) fire, what rite and what expiation would there be in that case?' When uniting, these two (fires), if unappeased, would indeed be liable to burn up the Sacrificer's family and cattle: let him therefore utter upon them the text , 'Unite ye two, and get ye on together, loving, radiant, well disposed, dwelling together for food and drink!--Together have I broughtyour minds, together your rites, together your thoughts: O Agni Purîshya, be thou the overlord, and bestow thou food and drink upon our Sacrificer!' He thereby bespeaks peace on the part of those two for the safety of the Sacrificer's family and cattle.
4	3	5	But if his heart should at all misgive him, let him prepare a cake on eight potsherds to Agni Agnimat (the fire possessed of a fire). The course of procedure thereof (is as follows):--he should recite seventeen kindling-verses; the two butter-portions relate to the slaying of Vritra ; the samyâgyâs  are two Virâg verses; and the invitatory and offering formulas (of the chief oblation) are as follows:--, Agni is kindled by Agni, he, the sage, the youthful house-lord, the tongue-mouthed bearer of oblations;' and the yâgyâ, 'For thou, O Agni, art kindled by Agni, priest, as thou art, by a priest, friend by friend.' He thereby bespeaks peace on the part of those two, for the safety of the Sacrificer's family and cattle. This, then, is the rite performed in that case.
4	3	6	They also say, 'If any one's Gârhapatya were to go out when the Âhavanîya has not gone out, what rite and what expiation would there be in that case?' Now, some take (a new fire) out from that same (Âhavanîya hearth, and carry it) forwards ,saying, 'The fires are the vital airs: it is the vital airs we thus take up for him.' But let him not do this, for if, in that case, any one were to say of him, 'Surely this one has obstructed the forward vital airs : this Sacrificer will die,' then that would indeed be likely to come to pass.
4	3	7	And some, indeed, take (the Âhavanîya) back (to the Gârhapatya ), saying, 'These two are the out-breathing and the up-breathing.' But let him not do this; for conducive to heaven, indeed, is the Agnihotra; and if, in that case, any one were to say of him, 'Surely, this one has descended again from the heavenly world: this (offering) will be in no wise conducive to heaven for him,' then that would indeed be likely to come to pass.
4	3	8	And some, indeed, churn out another Gârhapatya; but let him not do this, for if, in that case, any one were to say of him, 'Surely, this one has raised a spiteful enemy from out of the fire : speedily a spiteful enemy will be raised to him; he (the Sacrificer) will weep  for him who is dearest to him,' then that would indeed be likely to come to pass.
4	3	9	And some, again, extinguish (the Âhavanîya fire) and churn out another;--let him not yield to a desire for this; (for if, in that case, any one were tosay of him ), 'He has caused to be extinguished even what was left him: no heir will remain to him,' then that would indeed be likely to come to pass.
4	3	10	Let him rather proceed thus:--having lifted the two fires on the two churning-sticks , let him betake himself northwards, and, having churned out (the fire), let him remain there offering; for in this way he passes no censure on any one, and towards night offering is made by him at his new resting-place.
4	4	1	And, in the morning, having taken out the ashes, and smeared (the fire-places) with cow-dung, he lifts the two fires on the churning-sticks, and returns (to the offering-ground). Having then churned out the Gârhapatya, taken out the Âhavanîya, and brought the Anvâhârya-pakana (to the southern hearth), he should prepare a cake on eight potsherds to Agni Pathikrit (the path-maker). The course of procedure thereof (is as follows):--he should recite those same seventeen kindling-verses; the two butter-portions relate to the slaying of Vritra ; the samyâgyâs are two Virâg verses ; and the invitatory and offering formulas are as follows:--, 'For thou, most wise Agni, divine disposer, readily knowest the ways and paths at sacrifices;' and the yâgyâ , 'We have entered upon the path of the gods to carry on what we can do: the wise Agni shall sacrifice,he shall be the priest, he shall order the sacrifices and their seasons;' for Agni is the path-maker, the guide of paths: he, verily, guides him upon the path of sacrifice. This, then, is the rite performed in that case.
4	4	2	They also say, 'If any one's fires were to come in contact with each other, what rite and what expiation would there be in that case?' If this burning (fire) were to come (to the other) from behind, he may know that light has come to him from beyond; that the gods have helped him, and that he will become more glorious. But if his heart should at all misgive him, let him prepare a cake on eight potsherds for Agni Viviki (the discerning). The course of procedure thereof (is as follows):--he should recite those same seventeen kindling-verses; the two butter-portions relate to the slaying of Vritra; the samyâgyâs are two Virâg verses; and the invitatory and offering formulas are as follows:--, 'Thy brilliant, wind-sped flames, bright Agni, spread in every direction: the divine ninefold destroyers overpower the woods, boldly crushing them;' and the yâgyâ , 'The tribes of men glorify thee, Agni, the discerning knower of offerings, and most liberal dispenser of treasures; thee, O wealthy one, dwelling in secret, yet visible to all, loud-sounding offerer of sacrifice, glorying in ghee!' And if any one should desire to rid himself of his spiteful enemy, let him, with that object in view, perform this offering, and he verily will rid himself of him. This; then, is the rite performed in that case.
4	4	3	If, however, this burning (fire) were to come from this side, he may know that he will overcome his spiteful enemy; that he will become more glorious. But if his heart should at all misgive him, let him prepare a cake on eight potsherds for Agni Samvarga (the despoiler). The course of procedure thereof (is as follows):--he should recite those same seventeen kindling-verses; the two butter-portions relate to the slaying of Vritra, the samyâgyâs are two Virâg verses; and the invitatory and offering formulas are as follows:--, 'From the far region cross thou over to the near: protect thou that wherein I am!' and the yâgyâ , 'Desert us not in this great strife, like as the bearer of a load: win thou the spoil (sam vargam gaya), win riches thou!' And if any one desire to despoil his spiteful enemy, let him, with that object in view, perform this offering, and he verily will despoil him. This, then, is the rite performed in that case.
4	4	4	They also say, 'If the lightning were to burn any one's (sacrificial fire), what rite and what expiation would there be in that case?' Let him know that light has come to him from above; that the gods have helped him, and that he will become more glorious. But if his heart should at all misgive him, let him prepare a cake on eight pot sherds for Agni Apsumat (abiding in the waters). The course of procedure thereof (is as follows):he should recite those same seventeen kindling-verses; the two butter-portions relate to the slaying of Vritra; the samyâgyâs are two Virâg verses; and the invitatory and offering formulas are as follows: --, 'In the waters, O Agni, is thy seat; as such thou clingest to plants: being in (their) womb, thou art born again;' and the yâgyâ , 'Thou art the child of the herbs, the child of the trees, the. child of all that is, O Agni, thou art the child of the waters;'--he thereby bespeaks peace on the part of those two (fires) for the safety of the Sacrificer's family and cattle. This, then, is the rite performed in that case.
4	4	5	They also say, 'If any one's fires were to come in contact with impure (profane) fires, what rite and what expiation would there be in that case?' Let him prepare a cake on eight potsherds for Agni Suki (the bright),--the course of procedure thereof (is as follows):--he should recite those same seventeen kindling-verses; the two butter-portions relate to the slaying of Vritra; the samyâgyâs are two Virâg verses; and the invitatory and offering formulas are as follows:--, 'Agni of brightest work, the bright priest, the bright sage, brightly he shineth with offering fed;' and the yâgyâ , 'Up rise thy flames, the bright, the pure, the shining, thy lights, O Agni;'--he thereby bespeaks peace to those two (kinds of fires) for the safety of the Sacrificer's family and cattle. This, then, is the rite performed in that case.
4	4	6	They also say, 'If the sun were to set on any one's Âhavanîya not yet having been taken out, what rite and what expiation would there be in that case?' Verily, those rays (of the sun) are the All-gods: they go from him, and that (Agnihotra) failshim, because the gods go from him; and after that failure--whether he know it or know it not--those two (fires) say, 'He (the sun) has set on his unlifted (fire).' In such a case let him proceed thus:--having fastened a piece of yellow gold to a plant of darbha grass, let him order it to be taken towards the back (west): thus it is made of the form of him who shines yonder; and that (sun) being the day, it is made of the form of the day. And darbha plants are a means of purification : he thus purifies it thereby. Having then kindled some firewood, let him order it to be taken forward (to the Âhavanîya hearth). A Brâhmana descended from a Rishi should take it out, for a Brâhmana descended from a Rishi represents all the deities: it is thus with the help of all the deities that he causes it (the fire) to succeed. Having laid it down, he returns, and having placed ghee on the Gârhapatya, taken it off, purified it and looked down on it , he takes ghee by four ladlings, and, having seized a log, he hastens up to the front; and, having put the log on the Âhavanîya, he bends his right knee, and offers with, 'To the All-gods, hail!' Even as one would call (back) to him a Brâhmana staying at one's dwelling, when he goes away offended, by (presenting him with) a cow longing for the bull, so he thereby calls to him the All-gods; and they indeed acknowledge, andturn to, him. This, then, is the rite performed in that case.
4	4	7	They also say, 'If the sun were to rise over any one's Âhavanîya not having been taken out, what rite and what expiation would there be in that case?' Verily, those rays are the All-gods; and, having dwelt there, they now go from him, and that (Agnihotra) fails him, because the gods go from him; and after that failure--whether he know it or know it not--those two (fires) say, 'He (the sun) has risen on his unlifted (fire)' In such a case let him proceed thus:--having fastened a piece of white gold (silver) to a plant of darbha grass, let him order it to be taken towards the front: thus it is made of the form of the moon; and, the moon being the night, it is made of the form of the night. And darbha plants are a means of purification: he thus purifies it thereby. Having then kindled some firewood, let him order it to be taken after (the piece of silver). A Brâhmana descended from a Rishi should take it out, for a Brâhmana descended from a Rishi represents all the deities: it is thus with the help of all the deities that he causes it (the fire) to succeed. Having laid it down, he returns, and, having placed ghee on the Gârhapatya, taken it off, purified it and looked down upon it, he takes ghee in the same way as it was taken before, and, having seized a log, he hastens up to the front; and, having put the log on the Âhavanîya, he bends his right knee and offers with, 'To the All-gods, hail!' The import is the same as before; and, verily, no hurt and no harm of any kind befalls where that expiation is made. This, then, is the rite performed in that case.
5	1	1	They also say, 'If that performer of a long sacrificial session--to wit, he who (regularly) offers the Agnihotra--were to die whilst staying abroad, are they to sacrifice for him or not?' Now, some indeed think that (his Agnihotra) should be offered till they get home ; but let him not do so, for that (fire) does not submit thereto that they should offer to it, as for the burning of a dead body: it is rather to sacrifice and oblations that it submits, and, unable to endure it, it stays by him with impatience.
5	1	2	And some, indeed, say, 'They (the fires) should lie in the very same condition, kept up (with fuel) but without offering being made on them;' but let him not do so, for that (fire) does not submit thereto that they should kindle it as for the burning of a dead body: it is rather to sacrifice and oblations that it submits, and, unable to endure it, it stays by him with impatience.
5	1	3	And some, indeed, having lifted the two fireson the churning-sticks, lay them down, and churn it (the new fire) out on his being brought (home); but let him not do so, for that (fire) does not submit thereto that they should churn it out as for the burning of a dead body: it is rather to sacrifice and oblations that it submits, and, unable to endure it, it stays by him with impatience.
5	1	4	Let him rather proceed thus:--let him hid them seek for a cow suckling an adopted calf, and let him make offering with milk from her; for tainted is that milk which comes from a cow suckling an adopted calf, and tainted is the Agnihotra of one who is dead: by thus removing the tainted by the tainted, he becomes more glorious.
5	1	5	Concerning this there also is a simile:--if two smashed cars were to (be made to) unite there would be at least one (fit) for driving.
5	1	6	The procedure of this same Agnihotra (is as follows):--He causes her to be milked whilst eastward invested ; for, sacrificially invested, one gets (the Agnihotra-cow) milked for the gods, but in the case of the Fathers it is done thus.
5	1	7	He does not put (the milk) on the (burning) coals ; for were he to put it on coals he would be doing (what is done) for the gods: having shifted some hot cinders from the Gârhapatya towards the right (south) side, he puts it thereon, and thus makes it to be sacred to the Fathers.
5	1	8	He does not cause the light (of a burning straw) to fall upon it, nor does he pour water to it; for were he to make the light fall on it, and to pour water to it, he would be doing-(what is done) for the gods. He does not take it off thrice, setting it down each time ; for were he take it off thrice, setting it down each time, he would be doing (what is done) for the gods: only once he takes it off drawing it downwards , and thus makes it to be sacred to the Fathers.
5	1	9	He does not say, 'I will ladle out !' nor does he ladle out (the milk) four times; for were he to say 'I will ladle out!' and were he to ladle out four times, he would be doing (what is done) for the gods: only once he silently turns it upside down (into the spoon), and thus makes it to be sacred to the Fathers.
5	1	10	He does not take it (to the Âhavanîya) whilst holding a kindling-stick over (the handle of the spoon ); for were he to take it (there) whilst holding a kindling-stick over it, he would be doing (what is done) for the gods: he takes it whilst holding (a billet) underneath, and thus makes it to be sacred to the Fathers.
5	1	11	He does not pass along the north side of the Gârhapatya , for were he to pass along the northside of the Gârhapatya he would be doing (what is done) for the gods: he passes along the south side of the Gârhapatya, and thus makes it to be sacred to the Fathers.
5	1	12	And that sacrificial grass which (ordinarily) is lying with its tops towards the north he lays so as to have its tops towards the south, and thus makes (the offering) to be sacred to the Fathers. And having put a kindling-stick on the Âhavanîya, and bent his left knee, he silently turns (the ladle) once upside down (pouring the milk into the fire) and thus makes it to be sacred to the Fathers. He neither shakes (the spoon) upwards , nor wipes it, nor does he eat (the milk left in the spoon), nor does he throw it out: he thus makes it to be sacred to the Fathers.
5	1	13	They also say, 'If that performer of a long sacrificial session--to wit, he who (regularly) offers the Agnihotra--were to die whilst staying abroad, how would they supply him with his fires?' Well, some, having burnt him, bring (the bones) home and make the fires smell him as he is brought; but let him not do this, for this would be as if he were to seek to cause the seed implanted in one womb to be born forth from another womb. Having brought home the bones, let him throw them on a black antelope skin, and arrange them in accordance with man's form, and having covered them with wool and sprinkled with ghee, let him by burning unite himwith his fires: he thus causes him to be born from his own (maternal) womb.
5	1	14	And some, indeed, burn him in (ordinary) fire (procured) in the village; but let him not do this, for such fire is a promiscuous eater, an eater of raw flesh: it would be capable of devouring him completely, together with his sons and his cattle.
5	1	15	And some, indeed, burn him in a forest-fire; but let him not do this; for such fire is unappeased: it would be capable of burning him up together with his sons and his cattle.
5	1	16	And some, indeed, burn him in a firebrand; but let him not do this; for such fire belongs to Rudra: it would be capable of destroying him together with his sons and his cattle.
5	1	17	And some, indeed, build up a funeral pile in the midst of the (three) fires, and, by burning him, unite him with his fires, thinking, 'There,--to wit, in the midst of his fires,--assuredly is the Sacrificer's abode.' But let him not do this; for if in that case any one were to say of him, 'Verily, this one has caused a cutting up in the middle of the village: the cutting up of him will speedily come about : he will weep for his dearest;' then that would indeed be likely to come to pass.
5	2	1	Now, Nâka Maudgalya once said, 'If he believe the Sacrificer to be about to die, let him takeup the two fires in the churning-sticks, and, having churned out (a new fire), let him continue offering (the Agnihotra) at whatever place may have commended itself to him for the immolation . And if the Sacrificer should then depart this world,--
5	2	2	Let him build a pile for him  in the midst of his fires, and, by burning him, unite him with his fires.' But let him not do this; for, verily, that (fire) does not submit thereto that they should make offering to it as for the burning of a dead body: it is rather to sacrifice and oblations that it submits, and, unable to endure it, it stays by him with impatience.
5	2	3	He should rather proceed thus:--let him bid them seek three pots, and, having put therein either (dried) cowdung or straw , let him place them separately on the (three) fires; and let them then burn him by means of the fires produced from that blaze: in this way he is indeed burned by (these) fires, though not visibly, so to speak.
5	2	4	Wherefore, also, it has been said by the Rishi , 'The Agni who was born from Agni, from the pain of the earth or be it of the sky; whereby Visvakarman begatliving beings, him, O Agni, may thy wrath spare!' As the verse, so its explanation.
5	2	5	Now, in the first place, he cleanses him of all foul matter, and causes the foul matter to settle on this (earth); for this (earth) is indeed foul matter: he thus consigns foul matter to foul matter. For, indeed, from that intestine of his, filled with foul matter, when it is burnt, a jackal is produced: (hence he removes it), 'lest a jackal should be produced.' But let him not do this, or his family will be liable to starve. Having washed him out inside, he anoints him with ghee, and thus makes it (the body) sacrificially pure.
5	2	6	He then inserts seven chips of gold in the seven seats of his vital airs; for gold is light and immortality: he thus bestows light and immortality on him.
5	2	7	Having then built a pile for him in the midst of his fires, and spread out a black antelope skin with the hairy side upwards, and the neck-part towards the east, he lays him down thereon with the face looking upwards, and puts the guhû-spoon filled with ghee on his right, and the upabhrit on his left hand, the dhruvâ on the breast, the Agnihotra-ladle on the mouth, two dipping-spoons on the nostrils, two prâsitra-haranas  on the ears, the cup used for carrying forward the lustral water on the head, two winnowing-baskets at the sides, on the belly the vessel used for holding the cuttings (of the idâ), filled with clotted ghee, the wedge (yoke-pin) beside the male organ, two mallets beside the testicles, and behind them the mortar and pestle,the other sacrificial vessels between the thighs; and the wooden sword on the right hand.
5	2	8	Thus supplied with the sacrificial weapons (implements), that Sacrificer passes on to that place which has been won by him in heaven, even as if one who fears spoliation were to escape it; and, verily, those fires (which are) to be enkindled (will) lovingly touch him, even as sons lovingly touch their father when he comes home after staying abroad, and make everything ready for him .
5	2	9	If the Gârhapatya were to reach him first, one may know that the permanent fire has reached him first: that he will permanently establish himself, and that those behind him will permanently establish themselves in this world.
5	2	10	And if the Âhavanîya were to do so, one may know that the foremost fire has reached him first: that he has been foremost in conquering the (other) world, and that those behind him will be foremost in this world.
5	2	11	And if the Anvâhâryapakana were to do so, one may know that the food-eating fire has reached him first: that he will eat food, and that those behind him will eat food (be prosperous) in this world.
5	2	12	And if they all (were to reach him) at the same time, one may know that he has conquered a blessed world. Such, then, are the distinctions in this respect.
5	2	13	This, then, is that offering of the Sacrificer's body which he performs at the end: front out of that place which has been won by him in heaven he arises immortal in the form of an oblation.
5	2	14	Whatever stone and earthen (vessels of the deceased) there are they may be given to a Brâhmana ; but, verily, he who accepts them is regarded as a remover of corpses. Let them rather throw these (vessels) into the water, for the waters are the foundation of all this (universe): he thus establishes him firmly on the waters.
5	2	15	Either a son (of the deceased), or a brother, or some other Brâhmana then performs that offering , with , 'From out of him thou (O Agni) art born: from out of thee let this N.N. be born again into the heavenly world, hail! They then go away without looking back. and touch water.
6	1	1	Verily, Pragâpati, the sacrifice, is King Soma; and these deities to whom he offers, and these oblations which he offers, are forms of him.
6	1	2	If any part of the sacrifice were to fail, let him make an oblation with regard to that same deity for whom he may have intended (that part),--on the Âhavanîya, if it is during the initiation and the Upasads; on the Âgnîdhra, if it is at the Soma-pressing;--for whatever joint of the sacrifice fails, that breaks; and whichever then is the deity in that (part of the sacrifice) through that deity he heals the sacrifice, through that one he makes the sacrifice complete again .
6	1	3	If, however, the sacrifice, resolved upon in his mind, were not to incline to him , let him perform an oblation with, 'To Parameshthin hail!' for Parameshthin (the most high) he (Soma ) then is: he repels evil, and the sacrifice inclines to him.
6	1	4	And if the sacrifice, bespoken by his speech  were not to incline to him, let him perform an oblation with, 'To Pragâpati hail!' for Pragâpati (the lord of creatures) he then is: he repels evil, and the sacrifice inclines to him.
6	1	5	And if any one's (people), having gone in quest of the King (Soma), do not come back bringing (Soma-plants), let him perform an oblation with, 'To the plant hail!' for the plant he then is: he repels evil, and the sacrifice inclines to him.

6	1	30	And if (his Soma) were to meet with any mishap when he has returned , let him perform an oblation with, 'To Vâta hail!' for Vâta (the wind) he then is: he repels evil, and the sacrifice inclines to him.
6	1	31	And if, after being looked at, (his Soma) were to meet with any mishap, let him perform an oblation with, 'To Nrikakshas hail!' for Nrikakshas (man-viewing) he then is: he repels evil, and the sacrifice inclines to him.

6	1	35	And if (his Soma) were to meet with any mishap whilst being taken down (to the water), let him perform an oblation with, 'To the Sea hail!' for a sea he then is: he repels evil, and the sacrifice inclines to him.
6	1	36	And if (his Soma) were to meet with any mishap when immersed, let him perform an oblation with, 'To the Flood hail!' for a flood he then is: he repels evil, and the sacrifice inclines to him.
6	1	37	These, then, are the thirty-three oblations he performs; for there are thirty-three gods, and Pragâpati is the thirty-fourth: with the help of all the gods he thus heals the sacrifice, and with the help of all the gods he makes it complete again.
6	1	38	The Brahman (superintending priest) himself should perform them, and no other than the Brahman; for the Brahman sits on the right (south)side of the sacrifice, and protects the sacrifice on the right side. If, however, the Brahman should not know (these formulas and oblations), any one who knows them may perform them; but (let him do so) after applying for leave to the Brahman, and with his permission. Now as to the meaning of these (formulas). Vasishtha knew the Virâg : Indra coveted it.
6	1	39	He spake, 'Rishi, thou knowest the Virâg: teach me it!' He replied, 'What would therefrom accrue to me?'--'I would teach thee the expiation for the whole sacrifice, I would show thee its form.'--He replied, 'Well, but tell me, if thou wert to teach me the expiation for the whole sacrifice, what would become of him to whom thou wouldst show its form?'--'Verily, he would depart from this world to the heaven of the living.'
6	1	40	The Rishi then taught Indra that Virâg;--but the Virâg, they say, is this (earth), whence he who possesses most thereof is the most powerful.
6	1	41	And Indra then taught the Rishi this expiation from the Agnihotra up to the Great Litany. And formerly, indeed, the Vasishthas alone knew these utterances, whence formerly only one of the Vasishtha family became Brahman; but since nowadays anybody (may) study them, anybody (may) now become Brahman . And, indeed, he who thus knows these utterances is worthy to become Brahman, or may reply, when addressed as 'Brahman !'
7	1	1	Indra slew Tvashtri's son, Visvarûpa. Seeing his son slain, Tvashtri exorcized him (Indra), andbrought Soma juice suitable for witchery , and withheld from Indra. Indra by force drank off his Soma-juice, thereby committing a desecration of the sacrifice. He went asunder in every direction, and his energy, or vital power , flowed away from every limb.
7	1	2	From his eyes his fiery spirit flowed, and became that grey (smoke-coloured) animal, the he-goat; and what (flowed) from his eyelashes became wheat, and what (flowed) from his tears became the kuvala-fruit .
7	1	3	From his nostrils his vital power flowed, and became that animal, the ram; and what (flowed) from the phlegm became the Indra-grain, and what moisture there was that became the badara-fruit .
7	1	4	From his mouth his strength flowed, it became that animal, the bull; and what foam there was became barley, and what moisture there was became the karkandhu-fruit .
7	1	5	From his ear his glory flowed, and became the one-hoofed animals, the horse, mule, and ass.
7	1	6	From the breasts his bright (vital) sap flowed, and became milk, the light of cattle; from the heart in his breast his courage flowed, and became the talon-slaying eagle, the king of birds.
7	1	7	From his navel his life-breath flowed, and became lead,--not iron, nor silver; from his seed his form flowed, and became gold; from his generative organ his essence flowed, and became parisrut (raw fiery liquor); from his hips his fire flowed, and became surd (matured liquor), the essence of food.
7	1	8	From his urine his vigour flowed, and became the wolf, the impetuous rush of wild beasts; from the contents of his intestines his fury flowed, and became the tiger, the king of wild beasts; from his blood his might flowed, and became the lion, the ruler of wild beasts.
7	1	9	From his hair his thought flowed, and became millet; from his skin his honour flowed, and became the asvattha tree (ficus religiosa); from his flesh his force flowed, and became the udumbara tree (ficus glomerata); from his bones his sweet drink flowed,and became the nyagrodha tree (ficus indica); from his marrow his drink, the Soma juice, flowed, and became rice: in this way his energies, or vital powers, went from him.
7	1	10	Now at that time he (Indra) had to do with Namuki, the Asura. Namuki bethought him, 'He has been undone once for all: I will seize upon his energy, his vital power, his Soma-drink, his food,' By (taking) that Surâ-liquor of his he seized upon his energy, or vital power, his Soma-drink, his food. He lay there dissolved. The gods gathered around him, and said, 'Verily, he was the best of us; evil has befallen him: let us heal him!'
7	1	11	They said to the two Asvins, 'Ye are Brahman physicians: heal ye this one!' They replied, 'Let there be a guerdon for us!' They spake, 'That he-goat there shall be your guerdon.' They said, 'So be it!' and hence the smoke-coloured (he-goat) is sacred to the two Asvins.
7	1	12	They (the gods) said to Sarasvatî, 'Verily, thou art healing medicine: heal thou this one!' She replied, 'Let there be a guerdon for me!' They spake, 'That ram there shall be thy guerdon!' She said, 'So be it!' and therefore the ram is sacred to Sarasvatî.
7	1	13	They then spake, 'Verily, there is even now as much in him (Indra) as that -bull: that one shall belong to him himself.' They said, 'So be it!' and therefore the bull is sacred to Indra.
7	1	14	The two Asvins and Sarasvatî, having taken the energy, or vital power, from Namuki, restored them to hire (Indra), and saved him from evil, 'Truly, we have saved him from evil so as to be well-saved (sutrâta),' they thought, and this becamethe Sautrâmanî: and this is the (saving) nature of the Sautrâmanî--it saves the self from death, and repels evil for whosoever thus knows that (saving) nature of the Sautrâmanî. There are (for this sacrifice) thirty-three Dakshinâs (presents to priests), for thirty-three were the gods who healed him: whence they say, 'Dakshinâs are healing medicine.'
7	2	1	Verily, his fiery spirit, his energy, or vital power, depart from him whom Soma purges either upwards or downwards.
7	2	2	As to this they say, 'Truly, the Soma-juice is the Brâhmana's food; and, indeed, it is not owing to Soma when a Brâhmana vomits Soma; and he who vomits Soma is one who, whilst being fit to (gain) prosperity, does not gain prosperity, and who, whilst being fit to (gain) cattle, does not gain cattle , for Soma is cattle.'
7	2	3	Let him seize for sacrifice that grey (he-goat) of the Asvins, the ram of Sarasvatî, and the bull of Indra; for the Asvins are the physicians of the gods, and it is by them that he heals this (Sacrificer); and Sarasvatî is healing medicine, and it is with her help that he prepares medicine for him; and Indra is energy (indriya), or vital power, and it is with his help that he bestows energy, or vital power, on this (Sacrificer).
7	2	4	The two Asvins, indeed, are the eyesight,fiery spirit; and inasmuch as there is (a victim) sacred to the Asvins, he (the priest) bestows eyesight, fiery spirit, on this (Sacrificer). And the ear also (he thereby bestows on him), for one and the same are the eye and the ear.
7	2	5	Sarasvatî is the breath, vital power; and inasmuch as there is (a victim) sacred to Sarasvatî, he bestows breath, vital power, on this (Sacrificer). And the off-breathing also (he thereby bestows on him), for one and the same are the breath (of the mouth) and the of breathing.
7	2	6	Indra is speech, strength; and inasmuch as there is (a victim) sacred to Indra, he bestows speech, strength, on this (Sacrificer); and mind also, for one and the same are speech and mind.
7	2	7	'He-goats are sacred to the Asvins, ewes to Sarasvatî, and cows (and bulls) to Indra,' they say: if these animals are sacrificed, he, by means of those deities, gains those (three) animals.
7	2	8	There is a mare with a foal : the one-hoofed (animal),glory, he thereby secures (for the Sacrificer ). There are hairs of wild beasts , for the purpose of securing the wild beasts;--there are hairs of wolf: vigour, the impetuous rush of wild beasts, he thereby secures;--there are hairs of tiger: courage, the sway of wild beasts, he thereby secures;--there are hairsof lion: might, the rule of wild beasts, he thereby secures.
7	2	9	There are grains of rice and grains of millet, grains of wheat and kuvala jujubes, Indra-grain and badara jujubes, grains of barley and karkandhu jujubes, malted rice and barley : both cultivated and wild-grain food he thereby secures; and by means of both kinds of food he duly lays energy and vital power into his own self.
7	2	10	With lead he buys  the malted rice, with (sheep's) wool the malted barley, with thread the (fried) rice-grain,--that lead is a form of both iron and gold, and the Sautrâmanî is both an ishti-offering and an animal sacrifice, so that he thereby secures both of these.
7	2	11	With wool and thread  he buys,--this, to wit, wool and thread, is women's work; and work, indeed, means energy, or vital power, and this latter is extinct in women: he thus secures (for the Sacrificer) that energy, or vital power, which is extinct in women.
7	2	12	Here now, other Adhvaryus buy the malted rice with lead from a eunuch, saying, 'That is that ; for the eunuch is neither woman nor man, and the Sautrâmanî is neither an ishti-offering nor an animal sacrifice.' But let him not do so, for the Sautrâmanî is both an ishti and an animal sacrifice, and the eunuch is something unsuccessful among men: they who do this thus place failure into the very mouth (opening) of the sacrifice. Let him rather buy them from a vendor of Soma, for the Sautrâmanî is Soma: he thus puts a form of Soma into the very mouth of the sacrifice so as to secure the sacrifice.
7	2	13	There is a pot (kumbhî) perforated with a hundred holes , for in many ways did that (Soma) flow out of (Indra); and a hundred-sized also, indeed, is the sacrifice: it is the sacrifice he thereby secures. There is a bowl (rata ): it is the real (or good) thing (sat) he thereby secures. There is a dish (kapya) for him to secure food. There is a filter, for they cleanse him, (the Sacrificer, by this offering). There is a tail (-whisk) for turning away evil. There is gold for him to secure form (or colour); it weighs a hundred (grains), for man has a life of a hundred (years) and a hundred energies: life, and energy, vital power, he thus lays into his own self.
7	2	14	There is an asvattha (ficus religiosa) vessel: honour he thereby secures. There is an udumbara (ficus glomerata) one: force he thereby secures. There is a nyagrodha (ficus indica) one: sweet drink he thereby secures. There are (earthen) pots (sthâlî): the food of the earth he thereby secures.
7	2	15	There are supernumerary  (vessels) of palâsawood: the palâsa (butea frondosa) is the Brahman (holy writ, holiness, the priesthood): it is by the Brahman that he gains the heavenly world. There are two feathers of a talon-slaying (bird) : courage, the sway of birds, he thereby secures. There are thirty-six of these (objects), for the Brihatî consists of thirty-six syllables, and cattle are related to the Brihatî: by means of the Brihatî he thus secures cattle for him.
7	2	16	As to this they say, 'The victims have one set of deities, and the cakes another set of deities: this is an improper performance ; how does it become right and proper?' To Indra belongs the last of the victims, and to Indra the first of the cakes; and Indra, indeed, is energy (indriya), or vital power: through (Indra's) energy he thus confers on him energy, or vital power; and through (Indra's) energy he secures energy, or vital power.
7	2	17	There is a cake to Savitri for him to become impelled by Savitri; and one to Varuna, for it is Varuna that seizes him who is seized by evil: through Varuna he thus delivers him from Varuna's power;--it is the final (cake): he thus delivers him finally from Varuna's noose.
7	2	18	Indra's (cake) is one on eleven potsherds, in order that he may secure (Indra's) energy, or vitalpower; for the Trishtubh consists of eleven syllables, and the Trishtubh is energy, or vital power.
7	2	19	Savitri's (cake) is one on twelve potsherds, for there are twelve months in the year, and the year means constantly existing food: from the year he thus secures for hire food.
7	2	20	Varuna's (cake) is one on ten potsherds, for the Virâg consists of ten syllables, and Varuna is Virâg (the widely ruling), the lord of food: through Varuna he thus secures food for him. In the middle (of the sacrifice) they proceed with (the offering of) these cakes, for the centre means their (mother's) womb: he thus causes them to be produced from their own (mother's) womb.
7	2	21	A mare with a foal is the sacrificial fee, for such a (mare) produces both the horse and the mule, and the Sautrâmanî is both an ishti-offering and an animal sacrifice: thus it is so in order that he may secure both of these.
7	3	1	By means of the Surâ-liquor Namuki, the Asura, carried off Indra's (source of) strength, the essence of food, the Soma-drink. He (Indra) hasted up to the Asvins and Sarasvatî, crying, 'I have sworn to Namuki, saying, "I will slay thee neither by day nor by night, neither with staff nor with bow, neither with the palm of my hand nor with the fist, neither with the dry nor with the moist!" and yet has he taken these things from me: seek ye to bring me back these things!'
7	3	2	They spake, 'Let us have a share therein, and we will bring them back to thee.'--'These things (shall be) in common to us,' he said, 'bring them back, then!'
7	3	3	The Asvins and Sarasvatî then poured out foam of water (to serve) as a thunderbolt, saying, 'It is neither dry nor moist;' and, when the night was clearing up, and the sun had not yet risen, Indra, thinking, 'It is neither by day nor by night,' therewith struck off the head of Namuki, the Asura.
7	3	4	Wherefore it has been said by the Rishi , 'With foam of water, Indra, didst thou sever the head of Namuki, when thou wert subduing all thine enemies.' Now, Namuki is evil: having thus, indeed, slain that evil, his hateful enemy, Indra wrested from him his energy, or vital power. Let him who has an enemy perform the Sautrâmanî: he thereby slays that evil, his hateful enemy, and wrests from him his energy, or vital power. In his (Namuki's) severed head there was the Soma juice mixed with blood. They loathed it. They perceived that (means of) drinking separately (one of) the two liquids,--'King Soma, the drink of immortality, is pressed ;'--and having thereby made that (Soma) palatable, they took it in (as food).
7	3	5	With , 'Thee, the sweet (liquor I mix) with the sweet (Soma),' he compounds (the ingredients for the preparation of) the Surâ-liquor , and makes it palatable;--'the strongwith the strong,' he thereby bestows energy on him (the Sacrificer);--'the immortal with the immortal,' he thereby bestows life on him 'the honeyed with the honeyed,' he thereby bestows flavour to it (the liquor);--'I mix with the Soma,' he thereby makes it (the Surâ-liquor) a form of Soma.
7	3	6	'Thou art Soma: get thee matured for the Asvins! get thee matured for Sarasvatî! get thee matured for Indra Sutrâman!' for these were the deities who first prepared that sacrifice, and with their help he now prepares it; and, moreover, he thereby provides these deities with their share. He distils it with a view to (its being like) the Soma-pressing. For three nights it remains standing, for the Soma remains standing for three nights after it has been bought: he thus makes it a form of Soma.
7	3	7	There are two Vedis  (altar-grounds),--'Two worlds in truth there are,' they say, 'the world of the gods, and the world of the Fathers.' One (of the Vedis) is in the north, and the other in the south, for the world of the gods is in the north, and the world of the Fathers in the south; by the northern one he secures the world of the gods, by the southern one the world of the Fathers.
7	3	8	There are both milk and Surâ-liquor; for milk is Soma, and the Surâ-liquor food: through the milk he secures the Soma-drink, and through the Surâ-liquor food. And milk is the nobility (chieftaincy), and Surâ-liquor the peasantry (clan); the milk he purifies after purifying the Surâ-liquor: he thus produces the nobility from out of the peasantry, for the nobility is produced from out of the peasantry.
7	3	9	With , 'Purified by Vâyu'spurifier is the backward-flowing, exceeding swift Soma,' he purifies (the liquor ) in the case of one purged by Soma: in a suitable manner he thus purifies him (the Sacrificer);--'Indra's faithful companion:' whatever energy, or vital power, had passed away from him with that (Soma), that he now restores to him.
7	3	10	With, 'Purified by Vâyu's purifier is the forward-flowing, exceeding swift Soma,' he purifies (the liquor) in the case of one who has vomited Soma: in a suitable manner he thus purifies him (the Sacrificer);--'Indra's faithful companion:' whatever energy, or vital power, had passed away from him with that (Soma), that he now restores to him.
7	3	11	With , 'She purifieth thy liquor,' he, for prosperity, purifies (the Surâ) in the case of one wishing for prosperity;--'thy Soma, she, the daughter of Sûrya:' the daughter of Sûrya (the sun) assuredly is Faith, and by faith that (liquor) becomes Soma juice, and by faith he makes it to be Soma-juice;--'with the perpetual tail,' for with a tail-whisk that (liquor) is purified.
7	3	12	With , 'The Brahmanand Kshatra he purifieth,' he purifies the milk : he thus produces the Kshatra from out of the Brahman, for from out of the priesthood the nobility is produced;--'the fiery spirit and energy;' fiery spirit and energy, vital power, he thus bestows on him;--'with the Surâ the Soma,' for with the Surâ-liquor is Soma;--'the juice, is distilled,' for from the distilled the juice is obtained;--'for joy,' to joy (intoxication), indeed, the Soma juice contributes, and to joy also does the Surâ-liquor: he thus secures both the joy of the Soma, and the joy of the Surâ;--'with the pure juice, O god, satiate the deities!' that is, 'with the pure juice satisfy thou the deities;'--'with sap bestow thou food on the Sacrificer,' sap and food he thereby bestows on the Sacrificer. The cups of milk are taken first, then the cups of Surâ-liquor: he thereby makes the peasantry obedient to the nobility.
7	3	13	With , 'Yea, even as the owners of barley cut their barley . . .,' (the Adhvaryu) fills (three) cups of milk,--barley-stalks are Soma-stems, and milk is Soma juice: by means of Soma he thus makes it Soma-juice. With a single (verse) he fills them: singly and solely on the Sacrificer he thus bestows prosperity, for milk is prosperity.
7	3	14	With , 'Separately, indeed, a seat, acceptable to the gods, hath been prepared for you two,' he fills the (three) cupsof Surâ-liquor; for separate, indeed, are the Soma-juice and the Surâ-liquor; and 'acceptable to the gods' he says, because these two are indeed acceptable to the gods; and 'separately a seat hath been prepared' he says, because there are two altar-grounds;--'do not ye mingle in the highest heaven!' he thereby keeps him (the Sacrificer) from evil;--'the potent Surâ-liquor thou art,' he thereby makes Surâ to be Surâ;--'and this is Soma,' he thereby makes Soma to be Soma;--'entering thine own seat, injure me not!' he thereby turns it (the Surâ-liquor) away to its own seat for his own safety. With a single (verse) he fills them: singly and solely on the Sacrificer he thus bestows fame, for the Surâ-liquor is fame.
7	3	15	Verily, the cups of milk are the nobility (chieftaincy), and the cups of Surâ-liquor are the peasantry (clan): thus, were he to draw (the cups) without interlinking them, he would detach the peasantry from the nobility, and the nobility from the peasantry, and would cause confusion between the higher and lower, and a failure of the sacrifice. He draws them so as to be interlinked , and thereby combines the peasantry with the nobility, and the nobility with the peasantry, for the prevention of confusion between the higher and lower, and for the success of the sacrifice.
7	3	16	And the cups of milk are the vital airs, and the cups of Surâ-liquor the body: thus, were heto draw (the cups) without interlinking them, he would detach the body from the vital airs, and the vital airs from the body, and the Sacrificer would be liable to perish. He draws them so as to be interlinked, and thereby combines the body with the vital airs, and the vital airs with the body; and, indeed, he also lays vital power (or life) into him: whence he who has performed the Sautrâmanî, and even he who thus knows this, attains the full (measure of) life.
7	3	17	And the cups of milk are Soma, and the cups of Surâ-liquor food: thus, in that both cups of milk and cups of Surâ-liquor are taken, he indeed secures for himself both the Soma-drink and food.
7	3	18	And the cups of milk are cattle, and the cups of Surâ-liquor food: thus, in that both cups of milk and cups of Surâ-liquor are taken, he indeed secures for himself both cattle and food.
7	3	19	And the cups of milk are domestic animals, and the cups of Surâ-liquor wild animals: thus, in that both cups of milk and cups of Surâ-liquor are taken, he indeed secures for himself both domestic and wild animals. And he mixes the cups of milk with both cultivated and wild-growing (fruit), whereby both cultivated and wild-growing food is secured to the domestic animals.
7	3	20	As to this they say, 'In that there are those wild beasts, this is a form of that cruel deity; and if he were to mix the cups of milk with hairs of those beasts, he would thrust the cattle into the mouth of Rudra, and the Sacrificer would be without cattle let him not mix them, or cattle would not be secured by him, for Rudra is the ruler of animals.' The cups of Surâ-liquor alone he mixes with hairs of thosebeasts: he thus puts into the Surâ what belongs to Rudra, whence by drinking Surâ-liquor one becomes of violent (raudra) mind; and on the wild beasts alone he thus directs Rudra's shaft so as to insure safety to the domestic animals; and cattle are secured by him and he does not thrust the cattle into the mouth of Rudra.
7	3	21	'That dysentery which spareth both the tiger and the wolf, the winged eagle and the lion, may it spare this (Sacrificer) trouble!--Whereas, as a child, joyfully sucking, I chafed my mother, so now, O Agni, I become freed from my debt: unharmed by me are my parents.'
7	3	22	With two eagle-feathers, the Adhvaryu and Pratiprasthâtri purify the Sacrificer, turned towards the cast behind the altar-ground , both upwards and downwards,--this is a form of the in-breathing and the upward breathing: the in-breathing and the upward breathing he thereby secures; for both upwards and downwards this breath passes along the body. With , 'Uniting ye are: unite me with happiness !' he touches the cups of milk: with prosperity and fame he thereby endows him. With, 'Disuniting ye are: disunite me from evil!' he touches the cups of Surâ-liquor: he thereby keeps him from evil.
8	1	1	Now, when Indra's energies, or vital powers, departed from him, the gods restored them by means of this very sacrifice. Both cups of milk and cups of Surâ-liquor are filled: they thereby restore to him his energies, or vital powers. On the northern fire they offer (from) the cups of milk, and thereby provide him  with the bright liquor, with the Soma-drink.
8	1	2	He (the Adhvaryu) offers (of the three cups of milk) with , 'By their devotions the buffalos quicken the sacrifice,'--the buffalos, doubtless, are the officiating priests, and devotion is sacrifice: through the priests he causes the sacrifice to prosper, and through the sacrifice the sacrificer ;--'the barhis-seated one, supplied with Surâ and goodly heroes,' supplied with Surâ, indeed, is this barhis-seated sacrifice, to wit, the Sautrâmanî: by means of the barhis (the sacred grass on the Vedi), and the sacrifice, he causes him to prosper;--'they who bestow Soma,'--they thus bestow the Soma-drink upon him;--'with the deities in heaven,'--they thus place him with the deities in heaven;--'may we enjoy ourselves,'--the Soma-juice, indeed, conducesto joy, and so does the Surâ-liquor: both the joy of Soma and the joy of Surâ he thus secures;--'worshipping Indra with good hymns of praise!'--for the hymn of praise is food for the gods, and the sacrifice also is food: by sacrifice, by food, he thus makes him successful. Having sacrificed, they drink (of the milk), and thereby increase what is prosperous with him.
8	1	3	He drinks  with , 'The (Soma) which the Asvins (brought away) from Namuki, the Asura,'--for the two Asvins indeed brought away that (Soma juice) from Namuki;--'and Sarasvatî distilled for the sake of Indra's strength,'--for Sarasvatî indeed distilled it for the sake of Indra's strength;--'that clear, sweet draught,'--for clear and sweet indeed is that draught, Soma;--'King Soma I now drink,'--it is thus king Soma that comes to be drunk by him. The cups of Surâ-liquor they offer (from) on the southern fire , and thereby keep him (the Sacrificer) from evil .
8	1	4	He (the Pratiprasthâtri) offers (libations from the cups of Surâ-liquor ), with , 'What essence there is of thine, gathered from the plants,' for this Surâ-liquor, indeed, is the essenceof both the waters and the plants: by the essence of both the waters and the plants he thus causes him to prosper;--'the strength of the Soma-juice together with the Surâ-liquor,'--he thereby secures what strength there is in the Soma-juice and in the Surâ-liquor;--'by that exhilarating drink quicken thou the Sacrificer,'--that is, 'by that exhilarating drink gladden thou the Sacrificer;'--'Sarasvatî, the Asvins, Indra, and Agni,'--by deities he (the priest) thus causes the sacrifice to prosper, and by deities and sacrifice the Sacrificer. Having made the offering, they drink (the liquor), and thereby cause to prosper what is unprosperous with him.
8	1	5	He drinks, with , 'Whatever is mingled herewith of the juicy Soma,'--he thereby secures for him the essence (juice) of the effused (extracted) and the infused  (Soma);--'which Indra drank with eagerness,'--for Indra, indeed, drank it with eagerness;--'that (essence) thereof (I drink) with propitious mind,'--for unpropitious, as it were, to a Brâhmana is that drink, the Surâ-liquor: having thus made it propitious, he takes it to himself;--'King Soma I drink,'--it is thus king Soma that comes to be drunk by him.
8	1	6	Here, now, other Adhvaryus hire some Râganya or Vaisya with the view that he shall drink that (liquor); but let him not do this; for, indeed, this Soma-drink falls to the share of the fathers and grandfathers of whoever drinks (the liquor ) onthis occasion. Having shifted three coals of the southern fire to outside the enclosing-stones , he may there offer (of the liquor) with these (three) utterances :--
8	1	7	'To the Svadhâ-loving Fathers be Svadhâ, adoration!' he thereby places the Fathers with the Svadhâ in the world of the Fathers.--'To the Svadhâ-loving grandfathers he Svadhâ, adoration!' he thereby places the grandfathers with the Svadhâ in the world of the grandfathers.--'To the Svadhâ-loving great-grandfathers be Svadhâ, adoration!' he thereby places the great-grandfathers with the Svadhâ in the world of the great-grandfathers.
8	1	8	Having fetched water, he pours it (into the cups) with, 'The Fathers have drunk:' he thereby bestows food on them;--'the Fathers have enjoyed themselves:' he thereby causes them to enjoy themselves;--'the Fathers have become satisfied:' he thereby satisfies them;--'may the Fathers cleanse themselves!' he thereby purifies all of them from the first downwards, for the Sautrâmanî is a means of purification .
8	1	9	By three implements of purification he purifies,--three in number are these worlds: by means of these worlds he thus purifies him.
8	1	10	With 'pâvamânî  (verses)' they purify; for pâvamânîs are a means of purification: by a means of purification they thus purify him.
8	1	11	With three (verses) they purify each time,--there are three vital airs, the in-breathing, the up-breathing, and the through-breathing: it is by means of these that they purify him.
8	1	12	With nine (verses) they purify,--there are nine vital airs: by means of the vital airs they purify him, and when purified they establish him again in the vital airs.
8	1	13	They purify by means of a (goat's hair and sheep's wool) strainer,--such a strainer doubtless is a form (symbol) of goats and sheep: by means of goats and sheep they thus purify him.
8	1	14	They purify by means of a tail-whisk,--such a tail-whisk doubtless is a form of kine and horses: with kine and horses they thus purify him.
8	1	15	They purify by means of gold,--that (metal), to wit, gold, doubtless is a form of the gods: by means of a form of the gods they thus purify him.
8	1	16	They purify him by means of Surâ-liquor, for the Surâ is purified: they thus purify him by that which is purified; and even as the liquor, whilst being purified, is cleared of impure matter , so is that Sacrificer thereby freed from all evil who, knowing this, performs the Sautrâmanî, or who even knows this.
8	1	17	Here, now, they ask, 'Is the Sautrâmanî to be performed, or is it not to be performed, seeing that (in any case) they continuously repel from him all evil?' As to this Revottaras Sthapati Pâtava Kâkra once said, 'Even after making the surrender, one ought certainly to perform the sacrifice; for the Sacrificer is the body of the sacrifice, and the officiating priests are its limbs; and wherever the body is pure there the limbs also are pure; both of them, indeed, purify him, and both of them repel the evil from him: therefore even after making the surrender (of one's own self) one ought certainly to sacrifice.'
8	1	18	But, indeed, those who perform at the southern fire, go down to the world of the Fathers. He offers an oblation of ghee: ghee being (material of) sacrifice, it is by sacrifice that they establish themselves in the sacrifice.
8	1	19	He (the Sacrificer) offers, with , 'The Fathers who, one in form and one in mind, live in Yama's realm,--may their world,the Svadhâ, adoration, and sacrifice prosper among the gods!' he thereby commits the Fathers to Yama, and he also conquers the world of the Fathers. Having, all of them, invested themselves sacrificially , they betake themselves to the northern fire, for the northern fire  is this (terrestrial) world : they thus establish themselves in this world. He offers an oblation of ghee: ghee being sacrifice, it is from out of the sacrifice that they establish themselves in the sacrifice.
8	1	20	He (the Sacrificer) offers, with , 'Mine own (people) who are one in form and one in mind, living among the living,--may their fortune prosper with me, in this world, for a hundred years!' he thereby secures the good fortune of his own people, and he also confers long life on them. Whilst they hold on to each other, he (the Adhvaryu) offers milk, for milk is vital air and food: in the vital air, in food, they thus finally establish themselves.
8	1	21	He offers, with , 'Two paths for mortals have I heard of, (that of the Fathers and that of the gods ),'--'two pathsindeed there are,' they say, 'those of the gods and of the Fathers,'--'thereon all that liveth here passeth,' for thereon, indeed, everything living here passes;--'what there is between the father and the mother,'--the father, doubtless, is yonder (sky), and the mother is this (earth): by means of these two he leads the Fathers to the world of heaven. He (the Sacrificer) alone drinks what is left from the offering : to himself alone he thus takes prosperity, for milk is prosperity.
8	1	22	He drinks it, with , 'May this oblation be productive for me,'--for productive indeed it is, whether it be milk or Soma;--'possessed of ten heroes,'--the ten heroes, doubtless, are the vital airs: vital airs he thus takes to himself;--'possessed of all the troops,'--all the troops, doubtless, are the limbs: it is limbs he thus takes to himself;--'for well-being: breath-winning,'--the breath of life he thus wins;--'race-winning,'--a race (offspring) he thus wins;--'cattle-winning,'--cattle he thus wins;--'place-winning'--for it is for a place (in heaven) that he sacrifices: it is that he gains;--'safety-winning,'--the (place of) safety, doubtless, is the heavenly world: in the heavenly world he thus finally establishes himself;--'May Agni raise for me abundant offspring,and bestow ye upon us food, milk, and seed!' it is to those (priests) who offer for him that he thus says, 'Bestow ye all this upon me!' By means of gold they cleanse themselves ; for gold is immortal life: in immortal life they thus finally establish themselves.
8	2	1	Pragâpati created the (Soma-)sacrifice. He took it and performed it. When he had performed it, he felt like one emptied out. He saw this sacrificial performance, the Sautrâmanî, and performed it, and then he was again replenished; and, indeed, he who performs the Soma-sacrifice is, as it were, emptied out, for his wealth, his prosperity is, as it were, taken from him.
8	2	2	Having performed a Soma-sacrifice one ought to perform the Sautrâmanî: as a cow that has been milked would replenish again, even so, indeed, does he replenish himself,--he replenishes himself by offspring and cattle; and, verily, he who, knowing this, performs the Sautrâmanî, or he who (even) knows this, establishes himself in this world, and wins the heavenly world.
8	2	3	As to this Suplan Sârñgaya asked Pratîdarsa Aibhâvata , 'Seeing that neither does onebecome initiated, nor are Soma-shoots  thrown down (to be pressed), how then does the Sautrâmanî become a Soma-sacrifice?'
8	2	4	He replied, 'The observance of the fast, assuredly, is the head of the sacrifice, and the initiation its body. And the truth, doubtless, is of the form of the fast-observance, and faith of that of the initiation. And mind is of the form of the Sacrificer, and speech of that of the sacrifice.'
8	2	5	Thus, when he enters upon the fast-observance, he thereby restores the head to the body of the sacrifice, and he puts truth into faith, and the Sacrificer into the sacrifice.
8	2	6	Therefore at this sacrifice (the Sautrâmanî) the fast-observance  is the initiation. Now, the fast-observance is a male, and the initiation a female; and the truth is a male, and faith a female; and the mind is a male, and speech a female; and the Sacrificer is the male to his wife, whence wherever there is a husband there is a wife: and at the very outset of the sacrifice he thus sets up couples with a view to production.
8	2	7	'And, indeed, those (materials) are the Soma-shoots at this sacrifice,' they say, 'to wit, the malted rice, the malted barley, and the fried rice.'
8	2	8	The malted rice , indeed, is of the form of themorning-pressing, for the morning-pressing is this (terrestrial) world, and the latter relates to the Asvins, and Âsvina milk he pours (into the Surâ-liquor) the first night: he thus provides him (the Sacrificer ) with the morning-pressing--with its own world, with its own deity, with its own form .
8	2	9	And the malted barley is of the form of the midday-pressing, for the midday-pressing is the air, and the latter relates to Sarasvatî , and the Sârasvata milk he pours (into the Surâ) the second night: he thus provides him with the midday-pressing--with its own world, with its own deity, with its own form.
8	2	10	And the fried rice is of the form of the evening-pressing, for the evening-pressing is the sky, and the latter relates to Indra, and Aindra milk he pours (into the Surâ) the third night: he thus provides him with the evening-pressing--with its own world, with its own deity, with its own form.
8	2	11	The milk of one (cow) he pours (into the Surâ) the first night, the milk of two the secondnight, and the milk of three the third night: he thus provides him with the pressings, in accordance with their forms, and in accordance with their deities.
8	2	12	With , 'Hereof pour ye to the juice,' he pours in (the milk) for the sake of (conformity with) the Soma-pressing;--'(to) the Soma who is the supreme offering,'--for this, to wit, Soma, is indeed the supreme offering (-material): he thus makes it  to be the supreme offering;--'the manly one who hath rushed into the waters,' for both with water and between it is he (Soma) indeed pressed out;--'I have pressed out Soma by stones,' for by means of stones Soma is indeed pressed out: it is thus by means of stones he presses it out for the sake of (conformity with) the Soma-pressing.
8	2	13	As to this they say, ‘That Sautrâmanî, surely, is of the form of both effused (extracted) and infused  (Soma);--to wit, that essence of both water and plants, the milk, is of the form of the effused (Soma); and that essence of food, the liquor, is of the form of infused (Soma): by both (kinds of) pressings he thus expresses it, by both pressings he secures it.
8	2	14	As to this they say, 'Seeing that the Soma-juice is pressed out by stones, how as to the Sautrâmanî?' Let him reply, 'By the directions  and the Âprî-verses;' for the directions (praisha) are in the Brihatî (metre), and the pressing-stones are of bârhata nature: by means of stones the Soma-juice is indeed pressed out, and by means of stones he now presses it out for the sake of (conformity with) the Soma-pressing.
8	2	15	All (the praishas) contain (the word) 'payas' (milk), for in the form of milk Soma is (here) pressed ; they all contain (the word) 'Soma,' for the sake of (conformity with) the Soma-pressing; they all contain (the word) 'parisrut' (spirituous liquor), for in the form of spirituous liquor Soma is (here) pressed; they all contain (the word) 'ghrita' (ghee), for this--to wit, ghee--doubtless is manifestly a form of the sacrifice: he thus makes it to be manifestly a form of the sacrifice; they all contain (the word) 'madhu' (honey), for this--to wit, honey--is manifestly a form of Soma: he thus makes it to be manifestly a form of Soma.
8	2	16	They all refer to the Asvins , for the sake of healing-power ; they all refer to Sarasvatî, for the obtainment of food; they all refer to Indra, for the obtainment of energy, or vital power.
8	2	17	And, again, as to why they all refer to the Asvins, all of them to Sarasvatî, and all of them to Indra,--these, indeed, were the deities who firstprepared this sacrifice (the Sautrâmanî); with the help of these deities he thus prepares it; and, besides, he also provides these deities with a share.
8	2	18	The invitatory and offering formulas are made continuous , and relate to the same deities,--for the sake of continuity and uninterruptedness of the race (offspring). All of them relate to the Asvins, all of them to Sarasvatî, and all of them to Indra: the significance of this is the same as before.
8	2	19	The Âprî-formulas  are anushtubh verses; for the Anushtubh is speech, and with speech Soma is pressed: he thus presses it with speech, for the sake of (conformity with) the Soma-sacrifice. All of them relate to the Asvins, all of them to Sarasvatî, and all of them to Indra: the significance of this is the same as before.
8	2	20	The anupraishas  (after-directions) are in thegâgata metre; for the Gagatî is this (earth), and by means of her Soma is pressed: by means of her he thus presses it for the sake of (conformity with) the Soma-pressing. All of them relate to the Asvins, all of them to Sarasvatî, and all of them to Indra: the significance of this is the same as before.
8	2	21	This Sautrâmanî, then, is manifestly a Soma-sacrifice; and were the Sacrificer alone to drink (the liquor), it would be either an ishti-offering, or an animal sacrifice; but, for the sake of conformity of the liquor) to the Soma, all the priests drink thereof, for all the priests drink of the Soma-juice.
8	2	22	The Adhvaryus  drink (the contents of) the Âsvina (cup), for the Asvins are the Adhvaryus of the gods: they thus consume each his own share in his own abode.
8	2	23	The Hotri, Brahman, and Maitrâvaruna (drink that) of the Sârasvata (cup), for the Hotri is the voice of the sacrifice, the Brahman its heart, and the Maitrâvaruna its mind: they thus consume each his own share in his own abode.
8	2	24	The Sacrificer drinks (that of) the Aindra (cup), for this sacrifice, the Sautrâmanî, belongs to Indra, and even now he who sacrifices has his abode along with Indra: he thus consumes his own share in his own abode.
8	2	25	The Âsvina cup, indeed, is the eye, the Sârasvata one the vital air, and the Aindra onespeech. From the Âsvina (cup) he pours (the remains) into the Sârasvata one, whereby he combines his eye with the vital airs; from the Sârasvata cup) into the Aindra one, whereby he combines his vital airs with his speech, and also establishes his vital airs in (the channel of) speech, whence all the vital airs are established on speech.
8	2	26	Three (men) drink the Âsvina (cup), to wit, the Adhvaryu, Pratiprasthâtri, and Agnîdh; for this eye is threefold--the white, the black, and the pupil: he thus bestows on him the eye in accordance with its form.
8	2	27	Three (drink) the Sârasvata (cup), the Hotri, Brahman, and Maitrâvaruna; for threefold divided is this vital air--the in (and out)-breathing, the up-breathing, and the through-breathing: he thus bestows on him the vital air in accordance with its form.
8	2	28	Singly the Sacrificer drinks the Aindra (cup), for single is that distinction of the vital airs, speech: singly and solely to himself does he take that distinction, speech; whence he who has performed the Sautrâmanî becomes singly and solely the most distinguished among his own people, and so does even he who knows this.
8	2	29	The officiating priests (ritvig), doubtless, are the seasons (ritu), and the draughts (of liquor) are the months;--six priests drink, for there are six seasons: by means of the priests he thus secures the seasons.
8	2	30	There are twelve draughts , and twelvemonths: by means of the draughts he thus secures the months. The priests drink again and again by turns, whence the seasons and months succeed one another by turns.
8	2	31	The thirteenth draught the Sacrificer takes, for, indeed, that thirteenth month is manifestly the year itself: it is this he secures by obtaining (that draught). And, indeed, the Sautrâmanî is the same as the year, and by means of this he wins everything, and secures everything for himself.
8	2	32	There are three victims, for three in number are these worlds: it is these worlds he thereby secures,--to wit, this (terrestrial) world by that of the Asvins, the air by that of Sarasvatî, and the sky by that of Indra: he thus wins and secures these worlds for himself in accordance with their (peculiar) form and deity.
8	2	33	There are three sacrificial cakes, for there are three seasons: it is the seasons he thereby secures,--to wit, the summer by that of Indra, the rainy season by that of Savitri, and the winter by that of Varuna: he thus wins and secures the seasons for himself in accordance with their (peculiar) form and deity.
8	2	34	There are six cups (of milk and liquor), for there are six seasons: it is the seasons he thereby secures,--to wit, the spring and summer by the two Âsvina (cups), the rainy season and autumn by the two Sârasvata ones, and the winter and dewy season by the two Aindra ones: he thus wins and secures the seasons for himself in accordance with their form and deity.
8	2	35	The invitatory and offering formulas are made continuous, and relate to the same deities--for the sake of the continuity and uninterruptedness of the seasons. They are all of them invitatory-formulas and all offering-formulas , whence all the seasons pass onwards, and all of them return. All (the formulas) are first, all of them intermediate, and all of them last, whence all the seasons are first, all of them intermediate, and all of them last. All the cups have two (formulas, an) invitatory and (an) offering-formula,--this is of the form of day and night: it is the day and the night he thus secures for himself; whence both the seasons and the months are established on day and night.
8	2	36	The Sautrâmanî, truly, is the same as the year, and the same as the moon; and the Sacrificer is manifestly the sun: his vedi (altar-ground) is this earth, his uttara-vedi the air, his barhis the sky, his officiating priests the quarters, his fuel the trees, his ghee the waters, his oblations the plants, his fire Agni himself, his samsthâ (the particular form of sacrifice) the year--and, indeed, everything here, whatever there is, is the year; whence he who has performed the Sautrâmanî wins everything, and secures everything for himself.
8	3	1	Tvashtri, seeing his son slain, brought Soma suitable for witchery, and withheld from Indra. Indra, committing a desecration of the sacrifice, by main force drank off his (Tvashtri's) Soma juice. He went asunder in every direction,--from his mouth and vital airs his excellence and fame passedaway, and entered the cattle, whence cattle are one's fame: and famous, indeed, is he who, knowing this, is consecrated  by the Sautrâmanî.
8	3	2	The two Asvins and Sarasvatî then prepared for him this sacrifice, the Sautrâmanî, for the purpose of healing him, and thereby consecrated him: thereby he became the highest of gods, and so does he who is consecrated by that (offering) become the highest among his own people.
8	3	3	He consecrates him on a black antelope skin; for the black antelope skin is the sacrifice : it is at the sacrifice he thus consecrates him; on the hairy side (of the skin), for the hair is the metres: it is on the metres (or sacred writ) he thus consecrates him.
8	3	4	On a throne-seat he consecrates him, for imperial dignity is seated (established) on a throne-seat: by means of imperial dignity he thus causes him to attain imperial dignity.
8	3	5	It is made of udumbara wood, for the udumbara (ficus glomerata) is strength: for the sake of strength he thus is consecrated. It is knee-high, for knee-high is this (terrestrial) world, and it is for (the rule of) this world that the Kshatriya is consecrated; and the ruler (kshatra) indeed he becomes who is consecrated by the Sautrâmanî: therefore it is knee-high, and of unlimited size horizontally (in width and depth),--
8	3	6	For the throne-seat means royal dignity, and of unlimited prosperity is royal dignity. It is covered with plaited reed-work, for reed-grass is meet for sacrifice. Two of its feet stand on thenorthern, and two on the southern altar-ground , for the northern vedi is this (terrestrial) world, and the southern one the world of the Fathers: he thus consecrates him for both worlds.
8	3	7	Concerning this, Gaurîviti Sâktya, knowing this, once said, 'Like rulers , assuredly, we shall be in yonder world!' Perhaps  it was Rishabha Yâgñatura, king of the Svikna, who had told him so.
8	3	8	He places the throne-seat, with , 'Thou art the womb of the Kshatra, thou art the navel of the Kshatra!' for it indeed is the womb and navel of the Kshatra (ruling power).
8	3	9	He then spreads the black antelope skin thereon, with, 'May it not injure thee! do notinjure me!' for the black antelope skin is the sacrifice: (thus it is spread) for the safety of the sacrifice and his own self.
8	3	10	He then mounts it, with a verse to Varuna , for Varuna is the king of the gods: by means of his own deity he thus consecrates him ,--'He hath sat down, the upholder of the sacred law, Varuna, in the home-steads, for supreme rule, he the wise!'
8	3	11	He then throws down a gold and a silver plate (beneath his feet, the silver one beneath the left foot) with, 'Protect (me) from death!' (the gold one beneath the right foot  with,) 'Protect (me) from lightning!' The Virâg, doubtless, is the rain, and of this there are these two terrible forms, lightning and hail; of these the gold plate is of the form of lightning, and the silver one of that of hail: against these two deities he affords protection to him, whence he who has performed the Sautrâmanî has no fear of these two deities, as he also who thus knows this.
8	3	12	He consecrates him by sprinkling him with the fat gravy of the sacrificial animals, for the gravy of the animals means excellence: with that excellence, the essence of cattle, he thus sprinkles him. But that gravy is also the highest kind of food: with the highest kind of food he thus sprinkles him.
8	3	13	There are hoof-cups (of gravy), for on hoofs cattle support themselves: he thus causes him to obtain a support. There are thirty-three (such)cupfuls, for thirty-three in number are all the deities: by means of all the deities he thus consecrates him. He offers them with gagatî verses, for animals are of gâgata (movable) nature: by means of the Gagatî he thus secures cattle for him. With sixteen verses  he offers, for animals are of sixteen parts: he thus bestows excellence (or prosperity) on him part by part.
8	3	14	'With lead the wise, with wool and thread  the sages weave the web, the sacrifice: the Asvins, Savitri, Sarasvatî, and Varuna healed the form of Indra .' Each time he has offered two (cupfuls) together, he pours the residue into a bowl (sata): he thereby establishes the days and nights, the half-months, the months, and the seasons in the year, and hence these days and nights, half-months, months, and seasons are established (contained) in the year.
8	3	15	The bowl is made of reed, for the reed has its birth-place in the waters, and the waters are all the deities: by means of all the deities he thus consecrates him.
8	3	16	A rubbing down (of the Sacrificer) with all manner of sweet-smelling substances takes place (before sprinkling him with fat), for such a rubbing down with all manner of sweet-smelling substances means supreme fragrance: with fragrance he thus consecrates (anoints) him.
8	3	17	He sprinkles him (with the fat gravy) in front while (himself) looking towards the back (west), forfrom the front food is visibly eaten. On. every side (he sprinkles him) whilst moving round: he thus bestows food on him from all quarters, whence food is secured from all quarters by him who has performed the Sautrâmanî, or even by him who thus knows this.
8	3	18	With a formula to the Asvins he sprinkles him first , then with one to Sarasvatî, then with one to Indra: it is by means of these deities he thus consecrates him. Now, some consecrate him by means both of these deities and those utterances, 'bhûh bhuvah, svar,' 'for,' say they, 'these utterances ("earth, air, heaven") mean all this (universe) it is by means of all this (universe) we thus consecrate him.' Let him, however, not do so, but let him only consecrate him by means of those deities, for those deities, indeed, are all this (universe).
8	3	19	He consecrates him prior to the Svishtakrit (offering), for the Svishtakrit is the Kshatra: he thus consecrates him by means of the Kshatra (or, by a Kshatriya). And he consecrates him between (the oblation to) the Lord of the Forest  and the Svishtakrit, for the lord of the forest (or the tree) is Soma, and the Svishtakrit (maker of good offering) is Agni: he thus consecrates him after encompassing him by Agni and Soma; whence both those who know, and those who do not, say, 'A Kshatriya is the consecrator of a Kshatriya .'
8	3	20	They then lift him up  knee-high, then navel-high, then as high as the mouth; for the Vâgapeya doubtless is the same as the consecration, and the Sautrâmanî is a consecration; and even as there, at the Vâgapeya, he (the Sacrificer) mounts the sacrificial stake , like that is this rite.
8	3	21	As to this they say, 'But, surely, he who is consecrated by the Sautrâmanî moves away from this world.' Well, he descends again upon the black antelope skin, and, the black antelope skin being the sacrifice, he thus finally establishes himself on the sacrifice.
8	3	22	'Firmly  I establish myself in the Kshatra (lordship), in royal sway,'--in lordship and royal sway he thus establishes himself so as not to lose lordship and royal sway;--'firmly in horses I establishmyself, and in kine,'--in the midst of horses and kine he thus establishes himself so as not to lose horses and kine;--'firmly in the limbs I establish myself, and in the body,'--in the limbs and in the body he thus establishes himself so as not to lose his limbs and his body;--'firmly in the vital airs I establish myself, and in prosperity,'--in the vital airs and in prosperity he thus establishes himself so as not to lose the vital airs and prosperity;--'firmly in heaven and on earth I establish myself, and in the sacrifice,'--he thus establishes himself in these two, heaven and earth, within which is all this (universe).
8	3	23	He  then sings a Sâman (hymn-tune), for the Sâman means lordship (kshatra): with lordship he thus consecrates him; or the Sâman means imperial sway: by means of imperial sway he thus causes him to attain imperial sway. And, indeed, the Sâman is the essence of all the Vedas: he thus consecrates him with the essence of all the Vedas.
8	3	24	He sings it on a brihatî verse , for established on the Brihatî, as his excellence and foundation,that sun shines : he thus establishes him on the Brihatî, as his excellence and foundation.
8	3	25	He sings it on a brihatî verse relating to Indra, for this sacrifice, the Sautrâmanî, belongs to Indra, and even now he who sacrifices has Indra for his support: he thus consecrates him on his own support (or resting-place).
8	3	26	And as to why (these hymns) are called 'bracers ;' it is because by means of these Sâmans the gods braced Indra up to energy, or vital power: in like manner do the officiating priests, by means of these Sâmans, brace the Sacrificer up to energy, or vital power. 'Samsravase, visravase, satyasravase, sravase '--these are the Sâmans: they proclaimhim in these worlds. There are four finales, for there are four quarters: they thus establish him in all the quarters. All (the priests) join in the finale: with one mind they thus bestow excellence upon him.
8	3	27	As to this they say, 'Seeing that this Sâman is sung, wherein then does the recitation (uktha) of this Sâman consist, and what is its foundation; for unsuccessful is what is chanted unless it be followed by a recitation?'
8	3	28	'Thrice eleven are the gods;' this, indeed, is the recitation  belonging to that Sâman, this its foundation.
8	3	29	Or he (the Adhvaryu) takes a thirty-third cupful (of gravy), with , 'Thriceeleven are the gods,'--for there are indeed thrice eleven gods;--'three-and-thirty, bountiful,'--for there are thirty-three gods; 'with Brihaspati for their Purohita,'--Brihaspati is the Brahman (n.): he thus means to say, 'With the Brahman for their Purohita (family-priest);'--'at the impulse (sava) of the god Savitri,'--that is, 'impelled by the god Savitri;'--'may the gods protect me through the gods!' for the gods indeed consecrate him through the gods.
8	3	30	'The first with the second,'--for the first (gods, on earth) consecrate him along with the second ones (in the air);--'the second with the third,'--for the second ones consecrate him along with the third ones (in the sky);--'the third with  the truth,'--for the third ones consecrate him with the truth;--'the truth with the sacrifice,'--for the truth consecrates him with the sacrifice;--'the sacrifice with sacrificial texts,'--for the sacrifice consecrates him with sacrificial texts;--'sacrificial texts with hymn-tunes,'--for sacrificial texts (yagus) consecrate him along with hymn-tunes 'hymn-tunes with hymn-verses,'--for hymn-tunes consecrate him along with hymn-verses (rik):--'hymn-verses with invitatory verses,'--for hymn-verses consecrate him along with invitatory verses;--'invitatory verses with offering-verses,'--for invitatory verses consecrate him along with offering-verses;--'offering-verses with Vashat-calls,'--for offering-verses consecrate himalong with Vashat-calls;--'Vashat-calls with oblations,'--for Vashat-calls consecrate him along with oblations;--'May the oblations render successful my wishes! bhûh! svâhâ!'--having thus consecrated him by means of those deities from first to last, he thus, by means of oblations, renders all his wishes successful. Having then solicited an invitation from the officiating priests, he (the Sacrificer) drinks  (the remains of the cup of vasâ), for the officiating priests are the seasons: it is thus in the seasons that he solicits art invitation.
8	3	31	He drinks it, with , 'My hair is endeavour , my skin submission and approach , my flesh inclination, my bone wealth, and my marrow submission,'--for he who is consecrated by the Sautrâmanî enters the worlds and among the deities; he now has himself, invited amongst them , and thus he arises (in the other world) complete, with a whole body, and with (all) limbs.
9	1	1	Verily, from this sacrifice the man  is bornand whatever food a man consumes in this world, that (food), in return, consumes him in yonder world. Now this sacrifice is performed by means of spirituous liquor, and spirituous liquor (parisrut) is not to be consumed by a Brâhmana: he thus is born from that which is not (to be) consumed, and the food does not, in return, consume him in yonder world. Therefore this (sacrifice), the Sautrâmanî, is a Brâhmana's sacrifice .
9	1	2	The malted rice is the same as his (the man's) hair, the malted barley his skin, the fried rice his flesh, the filtering-cloth his bones, the mash his marrow, the raw liquor (parisrut) his life-sap (serum), the seasoning (and fermentative substances) his blood, the milk his seed, the mature liquor (surâ) his urine, and the impure matter the contents of the stomach.
9	1	3	Indra's cake is his heart, that of Savitri his liver, that of Varuna his lung, the asvattha and udumbara vessels his kidneys, the nyagrodha one his bile, the pan (sthâlî) his intestines , the supernumerary (vessels) his bowels , the two eagle feathers  the milt, the throne-seat his navel, the pot his rectum, the (pan) perforated with a hundred holes, the male organ,--and inasmuch as that (pan) is much perforated, therefore that organ is much divided,--the bowl (sata) is his mouth, the strainerhis tongue, the dish (kapya) his anus, the tail (whisk) his bladder,
9	1	4	And the sacrificial animal of the Asvins is his limbs, that of Sarasvatî his trunk, Indra's bull his form,--whence they say that man's form (wealth) is kine,--the gold (plate) is his vital strength; it is of the weight of a hundred (grains), whence mark has a life of a hundred (years).
9	1	5	The two cups of the Asvins are his eyes, and the ground wheat and kuvala (jujubes) his eyelashes; the two cups of Sarasvatî are his nostrils, and the ground Indra-grain and badara (jujubes) the hair in his nostrils; the two cups of Indra are his ears, and the ground barley and karkandhu (jujubes) the hair of his ears and his eyebrows.
9	1	6	And the hairs of wolf are the hair on his abdomen and that below; and the hairs of tiger are the hair on his chest and that of his armpits; and the hairs of lion are the hair of his head and his beard.
9	1	7	There are three sacrificial animals, for this body of man consists of three parts: it is the body he thereby wins (in heaven) for him;--what is below the navel (he wins) by that of the Asvins, what is above the navel and below the head by that of Sarasvatî, and the head itself by that of Indra: both as to its (bodily) form and as to its deities he thus delivers his own self from death, and makes it immortal.
9	1	8	There are three sacrificial cakes, for this life of man consists of three parts: it is life he thereby wins for him;--the early life (he wins) by that of Indra, the middle (part of) life by that of Savitri, and the last (part of) life by that of Varuna: both as to its (bodily) form and as to its deities he thus delivers his life from death, and makes it immortal.
9	1	9	There are six cups (of milk and liquor), for there are these six (channels of) vital airs in the head: it is the vital airs he thereby wins for him;--his eyes (he wins) by the two (cups) of the Asvins, his nostrils by those of Sarasvatî, and his ears by those of Indra: both as to its (bodily) form and as to its deities he thus delivers his own self from death, and makes it immortal.
9	1	10	The invitatory and offering-formulas are made continuous , and relate to the same deities--for the continuity and uninterruptedness of the vital airs. They are all of them invitatory formulas and all offering-formulas, whence all the vital airs pass onwards and all of them backwards. All (the formulas) are first, all of them intermediate, and all of them last, whence all the vital airs are first, all of them intermediate, and all of them last. All the cups have two (formulas, an) invitatory and (an) offering-formula,--this is of the form of the in (and out)-breathing and the up-breathing: it is the in-breathing and the up-breathing he thus secures for himself, and therefore all the vital airs are established on the in-breathing and the up-breathing.
9	1	11	Verily the Sautrâmanî is this body (of man): the Sacrificer is the mind, (that is) speech manifestly; the vedi (altar-ground) is the trunk, the uttara-vedi (high-altar) offspring, the barhis (grass-covering) cattle, the officiating priests the limbs, the fuel the hones, the ghee the marrow, the fire the mouth, the oblation is food, and the concluding rite is life, whence he who has performed the Sautrâmanî attains life.
9	1	12	And, verily, these two men that seem to be in the eyes, they belong to the Asvins, and the black (in the eye) belongs to Sarasvatî, and the white to Indra; and in that, when the victim of the Asvins is being (offered), he makes offering to these deities in common, thereby he puts those (parts of the body) together and takes them to himself.
9	1	13	Indra, assuredly, is the mind, Sarasvatî speech, and the two Asvins are the ears. Now, whatever one thinks in his mind of that he speaks with his speech, and what he speaks with his speech that one hears with one's ears: thus, in that, when the victim of Sarasvatî is being (offered), he makes offering to these deities together, thereby he puts these (parts of the body) together and takes them to himself.
9	1	14	Indra, assuredly, is the breath, Sarasvatî the tongue, and the two Asvins the nostrils; and inasmuch as through (the channel of) the breath (prâna) one introduces (prâ-nî) food into himself that is the reason of its being (called) 'prâna.' By means of the tongue one distinguishes the essence (taste) of food, and the nostrils, indeed, are the path of the breath; and in that, when the victim of Indra. is being (offered), he makes offering to these deities in common, thereby he puts those (parts of the body) together and takes them to himself.
9	1	15	Indra, assuredly, is the heart, Savitri the liver, and Varuna the lung; and in that, when Indra's cake is being (offered), he makes offering to these deities in common, thereby he puts those (parts of the body) together and takes them to himself.
9	1	16	Savitri, assuredly, is the breath, Varuna thethrough-breathing, and Indra the generative organ; and whatever food one eats by means of (the channel of) the breath through that he breathes with his through-breathing, and by means of the generative organ he sheds the essence of food as seed; and in that, when Savitri's cake is being (offered), he makes offering to these deities in common, thereby he puts those (parts of the body) together and takes them to himself.
9	1	17	Varuna, assuredly, is the womb, Indra the seed, and Savitri the generator of the seed; and in that, when Varuna's cake is being (offered), he makes offering to these deities in common, thereby he puts those (parts of the body) together and takes them to himself. And whosoever thus knows this comes into being along with these deities, and is born again (so as to be) along with these deities; he increases in offspring and cattle; he becomes firmly established in this world, and wins the heavenly world, whosoever, knowing this, performs the Sautrâmanî, or whosoever thus knows this.
9	2	1	Having performed the sacrifice they betake themselves to the purificatory bath; for after a Soma-sacrifice they do betake themselves to the purificatory bath, and the Sautrâmanî is the same as the Soma (sacrifice).
9	2	2	'Whatever contumelyagainst the gods, O divine gods, we have committed, from that sin may Agni deliver me; may he deliver me from all trouble!'--he thereby delivers him from the sin committed against the gods.--'Whether by day, whether by night we have committed sins, from that sin may Vâyu deliver me; may he deliver me from all trouble!'--he thereby delivers him from whatever sin he commits by day and night.---'Whether waking, whether in sleep we have committed sins, from that sin may Sûrya deliver me; may he deliver me from all trouble!'--what is awake is men, and what is asleep is the Fathers: he thus delivers him from guilt against men and Fathers.
9	2	3	'Whatever sin we have committed in the village, in the forest'--for either in the village or in the forest sin is committed: therefrom he delivers him;--'whatever in the assembly'--from the sin of the assembly he thereby delivers him;--'whatever in our organs of sense'--from the sin against the gods he thereby delivers him;--'whatever against the Sûdra or the Arya, whatever against the right of any one, thereof thou art the expiation,'--from all that sin he thereby delivers him.
9	2	4	'That we swear by the Inviolable Waters , by Varuna, therefrom deliver us, O Varuna!'--he thereby delivers him from sin against Varuna. 'O laving bath, laving thou glidest along,'--the bath, indeed, is that whirlpool (now produced) in the water, and that indeed is either Varuna's son or brother: it is him he thereby praises;--'with the help of the gods have I expiated  the sin committed against gods,'--he thereby expiates the sin committed against gods;--'with the help of mortals that committed against mortals,'--he thereby expiates the sin committed against mortals;--'preserve me, O God, from injury from the fiercely-howling (demon)!' whereby he means to say, 'Protect me against all inflictions!'
9	2	5	'In the ocean, in the waters, is thy heart,'--for the ocean is the waters, and water is sap: with that sap he thus supplies him;--'may the plants and waters unite with thee!'--he thereby supplies him with both kinds of sap, that which is in plants, and that which is in water--He goes two steps northward from out (of the water); for as much as the step is the briskness in man: with what briskness there is in him he thus leaves evil behind him.
9	2	6	With, 'May the waters and plants be friendly unto us!' he takes water in his joined hands; for water is a thunderbolt: he thus makes a covenant with the thunderbolt;--and with, 'May they he unfriendly unto him who hateth us, and whom we hate!' let him sprinkle it in whatever direction he who is hateful to him may be, and he thereby discomfits him.
9	2	7	With , 'As one set free (is liberated) from the stake, as he who sweateth (is cleansed) from filth by bathing, as the ghee is purified by the strainer, so may the waters cleanse me from sin!' he causes his garment to float away: even as one would pluck out a reed from its sheath, so he plucks him from out all evil. He bathes, and (thereby) drives the darkness (of sin) from himself.
9	2	8	'From out of the gloom have we risen,'--gloom is evil: it is gloom, evil, he thus keeps away;--'beholding the higher light ,'--this (terrestrial) world is higher than the water: it is on this world he thus establishes himself;--'God Sûrya, with the gods, the highest light,'--Sûrya, the highest light (gyotis), is the heavenly world: it is in the heavenly world he thus finally establishes himself. He walks along without looking back, and approaches the Âhavanîya,--
9	2	9	With , 'Along the waters have I gone this day,'--the essence of the waters he thereby secures for himself;---'with their essence have we united,'--the essence of the waters he thus takes to himself;--'rich in sap, O Agni, have I come: do thou unite (supply) me with splendour, with offspring, and with wealth!' he thereby invokes a blessing.
9	2	10	With , 'A kindler thou art:may we prosper !' he takes a kindling-stick, for a kindler of Agni (the fire) the kindling-stick indeed is. With, 'Enkindling thou art, fire thou art: lay thou fire into me!' he puts the kindling-stick on the Âhavanîya: he thereby kindles the fire, and, thus kindled, it kindles him with fire (energy) .
9	2	11	Being about to offer a pap to Aditi , he prepares it: Aditi being this (earth), he who offers Aditi's (pap) performs the sacrifice on this (earth), and by offering firmly establishes himself thereon. The sacrificial fee is a milch cow (with calf): the milch cow being this (earth), he milks out from the latter all his desires. The calf he gives away at the former (pap-offering to Aditi ), and the mother-cow at the latter; for when a calf sucks the mother-cow, the latter gives milk when she is given away, and from her, when given away, he thus milks all his desires.
9	2	12	As to this they say, 'Surely, he who goes down to the water for the purificatory bath falls away from this world!' Well, when he has come out from the bath, he offers a dish of curds to Mitra and Varuna; now Mitra is this (terrestrial) world, Varuna yonder world, and the dish of curds is what there is here between (those two): thus, when he offers the dish of curds to Mitra and Varuna, he establishes himself in these worlds. And Mitra, indeed, is the in-breathing, Varuna the off-breathing, and the dish of curds the food: thus when he offers the dish of curds to Mitra and Varuna, he finally establishes himself in the vital air, in food.
9	3	1	Now, Dushtarîtu Paumsâyana had been expelled from the kingdom which had come down to him through ten generations; and the Sriñgayas also expelled Revottaras Pâtava Kâkra Sthapati.
9	3	2	He said to Dushtarîtu Paumsâyana, 'I will perform the Sautrâmanî for thee, and will comer upon thee that dominion over the Sriñgayas.'--'So be it!' he replied. So he performed it for him.
9	3	3	Now Balhika Prâtipîya, the Kauravya king, heard (people say) this--'There is that Dushtarîtu Paumsâyana who has been expelled from the kingdom which has come down to him through ten generations: for him that Kâkra Sthapati wants to perform the Sautrâmanî and to confer upon him the dominion over the Sriñgayas.'
9	3	4	He said, 'I will just tell him that if he wants to confer dominion upon him, he will indeed exclude him from dominion.' He came to him at that particular time (of the sacrifice) when the cups (of milk and liquor) are drawn.
9	3	5	He said, 'Sthapati Kâkra, they say, Surâ-liquor must not be offered in the Âhavanîya-fire, nor anywhere else than in the Âhavanîya: if thou offerest Surâ-liquor in the Âhavanîya thou wilt cause social confusion and a repetition in the sacrifice , and if anywhere else than in the Âhavanîya thou wilt exclude him (the king) from dominion, and wilt neither place him in dominion, nor confer dominion upon him.'
9	3	6	He replied, 'I shall not offer Surâ-liquor in the Âhavanîya nor anywhere else than in the Âhavanîya thus I shall not cause social confusion nor a repetition in the sacrifice, and shall not exclude him from dominion; I shall place him in dominion, and shall confer dominion upon him.'
9	3	7	He said, 'How, then, wilt thou do it?' He then told him this:--At first, indeed, that Yagña (sacrifice, m.), the Sautrâmanî, was with the Asuras. He went forth towards the gods. He came to the waters, and the waters welcomed him, whence people welcome a better man when he comes to them. They said to him, 'We pray thee, come, reverend sir!'
9	3	8	He said, 'Nay, I am afraid: lead ye me forward!'--'Whereof art thou afraid, reverend sir?' they asked.--'Of the Asuras,' he said.--'Be it, then!' they said. The waters led him forward, whence he who is the protector leads forward him who is afraid; and inasmuch as the waters led him forward (pra-nî) therefore the waters (themselves) are 'led forward:' this is the reason why they are (called) Pranîtâh ; and, verily, firmly established is he who thus knows that nature of the Pranîtâh.
9	3	9	Now, the fore-offerings had been performed, but the fire had not been carried round  (the oblations), when the Asuras came after him. By means of the circumambient fire the gods shut out their hostile rivals, the Asuras, from Yagña (the sacrifice); and in like manner does this one now, by means of the circumambient fire, shut out his spiteful enemy from the sacrifice.
9	3	10	Verily, that Âhavanîya is the womb (seat) of the gods, and those two fires  on either side thereof are its immortal wings: thus, when they perform the sacrifice on the Âhavanîya, they indeed perform the sacrifice for the gods in the womb of the gods; and, verily, the continued sacrifice inclines to him, and the sacrifice is not cut off from him who thus knows this, or for whom, knowing this, this sacrificial rite is performed.
9	3	11	On the northern fire they offer (libations from) the cups of milk, on the northern fire they cook the sacrificial animals: the sacrificial animals, whilst being mortal, he thus places in the immortal womb, and them that are mortal he causes to be born (again) from out of the immortal womb; and, verily, whosoever thus knows this, or he for whom, knowing this, this sacrificial rite is performed, wards off the recurring death of his cattle, and the sacrifice is not cut off from him.
9	3	12	On the southern fire they offer (libations from) the cups of Surâ-liquor, near the southern firethey purify (the liquor) with triple strainers: the Fathers, whilst being mortal, he thus places in the immortal womb, and them that are mortal he causes to be born (again) from out of the immortal womb; and, verily, whosoever thus knows this, or he for whom, knowing this, this sacrificial rite is performed, wards off the recurring death of the Fathers, and the sacrifice is not cut off from him.
9	3	13	Now, inasmuch as these two fires are taken from the Âhavanîya, they are Âhavanîyas (offering-fires), and inasmuch as they do not again reach the Âhavanîya, they are not Âhavanîyas: he thereby obtains both kinds of oblations, that -which is (offered) on the Âhavanîya, and that which is (offered) on what is not an Âhavanîya--both what is offered and what is not offered.He (Balhika Prâtipîya) then went home, and said, 'It is not so (as we had thought): that kingdom of the Sriñgayas now belongs to Dushtarîtu;--in. such and such a manner has that Kâkra Sthapati this day performed at the sacrifice.'
9	3	14	On the northern fire they thus perform the rites of the sacrificial animals, the (animal) cakes, and the cups of milk, and what other (rite) there is: it is the gods, in the world of the gods, he thereby gratifies, and, thus gratified, they gratify him, and he wins the world of the gods.
9	3	15	In the southern fire they offer (libations from) the cups of Surâ-liquor, near the southern fire they purify (the liquor) with triple strainers: it is the Fathers, in the world of the Fathers, he thereby gratifies, and, thus gratified, they gratify him, and he wins the world of the Fathers.
9	3	16	Verily, the Sautrâmanî is the same as thebody, whence it is (clearly) defined, for defined is the body. And (Indra) Vayodhas (the bestower of strength), is the world, whence he is undefined , for undefined is the world. The Sautrâmanî is the body (trunk), and the Aindra (victim) and (the one to) Vayodhas  are the two arms; and inasmuch as there are those two animal offerings on both sides (of the Sautrâmanî), therefore these two arms are on both sides of the body. And as the sacrificial animal, so the sacrificial stake; and inasmuch as there are those two stakes on both sides of the stake of the Sautrâmanî (bull of Indra), therefore these two arms are on both sides of the body .
