1	1	1	In the first place that Agni (the Fire-altar), the year, is built ; thereafter the Great Litany (mahad uktham) is recited . When Pragâpati became relaxed, the vital fluid flowed upwards .
1	1	2	Now, that Pragâpati who became relaxed is the year; and those joints of his which became relaxed are the days and nights.
1	1	3	And that Pragâpati who became relaxed is this very Fire-altar which here is built; and those joints of his, the days and nights, which became relaxed are no other than the bricks;--thus, when he lays down these (in the layers of the altar), he thereby restores to him those joints of his, the days and nights, which had become relaxed: and thusit is even in this (building of the altar) that this Yagus is built up  and secured (for Pragâpati).
1	1	4	And that vital fluid (essence) of his which flowed upwards (became) the Great Litany: it is in quest of that vital fluid that (the priests) go by means of the Rik and Sâman. And when the Yagus marches in front in this (quest) , it is in order to fetch something that that (Veda) goes--even as (one might say), 'That one thing there is mine, I will fetch it,' so does that Yagus go in front (or forward). That (vital fluid) they obtain in the course of a year .
1	1	5	The Adhvaryu takes (draws) it by means of the Graha (Soma-cup); and inasmuch as he thereby takes (grab) it, it is (called) Graha . The Udgâtri puts the vital fluid into it by means of the (sâman of the) Great Rite (mahâvrata ); but, indeed, the (sâman of the) Great Rite is (equivalent to) all these (other) sâmans (hymn-tunes): it is thus by means of all the hymn-tunes that he puts the vital fluid therein. The Hotri puts the vital fluid therein by means of the Great Litany; but, indeed, the Great Litany is the same as all these rik (hymn-verses) : it is thus by means of all the hymn-verses that he puts the vital fluid into it (the Soma-cup).
1	1	6	When those (Udgâtris) chant (the stotra), and when he (the Hotri) recites (the sastra) afterwards, then he (the Adhvaryu) offers that (vital fluid, in the form of Soma) unto him (Agni-Pragâpati) at the Vashat-call; and thus this vital fluid enters him. For, indeed, they do not see it to be the Great Rite that lies there being praised, nor the Great Litany, but it is Agni alone they see; for Agni is the self (body), and thus those two, the Rik and the Sâman, enter him in the form of the vital fluid; and thus they both enter (join) the Yagus.
1	1	7	Now, that Agni (fire-altar) consists of pairs--the first layer and the second, and the third and fourth; and of the fifth layer the fire which is placed on the built (altar) is the mate. And, indeed, this body consists of pairs.
1	1	8	The thumbs (and great toes, 'aṅgushtha,' m.) are males, and the fingers and toes ('aṅguli,' f.) females; the ears ('karna' m.) are males, and the eyebrows ('bhrû,' f.) females; the lips ('oshtha,' m.) are males, and the nostrils ('nâsikâ,' f.) females; the teeth ('danta,' m.) are males, and the tongue ('gihvâ,' f.) is a female: indeed the whole (body) consists of pairs, and with this body, consisting of pairs, that (vital fluid) enters this Agni (the fire-altar), consisting of pairs .
1	1	9	This, then, is the entering therein;--even thus, indeed, he (Agni) consists of pairs ; but in thisway also he consists of pairs:--the fire-altar here built up is no other than this speech, for with speech it is built up; and the fire which is placed on the built (altar) is the breath; and the breath ('prâna,' m.) is the male, the mate, of speech ('vâk,' f.). And, indeed, this body is speech; and the breath which is in the body is its mate: with this mated body that (vital fluid) thus enters into the mated Agni.
1	1	10	This also is the entering therein;--there is indeed no fear of him (Agni) being without offspring to whosoever thus knows these two, the body and Agni, to be a pair; but, indeed, this body is food, as is said by the Rishi , 'The Dakshinâ winneth food which is our own self (breath).'
1	1	11	Now, this food, when eaten, becomes of two kinds,--that part of it which is immortal (remains) above the navel: by the upward vital airs it moves upwards and enters the air; but that part of it which is mortal tends to move away: it passes beyond the navel, and, having become twofold, enters this (earth), as urine and faeces. Now that which enters this (earth) enters the fire-altar  built here; and that which enters the air enters that fire which is placed on the built (altar). This also is the entering therein.
1	2	1	Pragâpati was desirous of gaining these worlds. He saw this bird-like body, the Fire-altar: hefashioned it, and thereby gained this (terrestrial) world. He saw a second bird-like body, the (chant of the) Great Rite : he fashioned it, and thereby gained the air. He saw a third bird-like body, the Great Litany : he fashioned it, and thereby gained the sky.
1	2	2	This built Fire-altar, doubtless, is this (terrestrial) world, the Great Rite the air, and the Great Litany the sky: all these, the Fire-altar, the Great Rite, and the Great Litany, one ought therefore to undertake together, for these worlds were created together; and as to why the Fire-altar is built first, it is because of these worlds this (terrestrial) one was created first. Thus with regard to the deity.
1	2	3	Now with regard to the body. The Fire-altar is the mind, the (chant of the) Great Rite the breath, and the Great Litany speech: all these one ought therefore to undertake together, for mind, breath, and speech belong together; as to why the Fire-altar is built first, it is because the mind is prior to the breathings.
1	2	4	The Fire-altar, indeed, is the body (trunk), the Great Rite the breath, and the Great Litany speech: all these one ought therefore to undertake together, for body, breath, and speech belong together; and as to why the Fire-altar is built first, it is because of him who is produced the trunk is produced first.
1	2	5	The Fire-altar, indeed, is the head, the Great Rite the breath, and the Great Litany the body:one ought therefore to undertake all these together, for head, breath, and body belong together; and as to why the Fire-altar is built first, it is because of him who is born the head is born first; and hence, whenever all these are undertaken together the Great Litany, indeed, is accounted the highest (âtamâm) , for the Great Litany is the body (or self, âtman).
1	2	6	As to this they say, 'If all these are difficult to obtain together, what (means of) obtaining them is there?'--In the Gyotishtoma (form of the) Agnishtoma : let him perform offering with the Gyotishtoma Agnishtoma.
1	2	7	In this Gyotishtoma Agnishtoma the Bahishpavamâna (stotra) is (in) the Trivrit (stoma)--that is the head of the rite; the two other Pavamânas are (in) the Pañkadasa and Saptadasa (stomas)--they are the two wings; the Hotri's Âgya (stotra) is (in) the Pañkadasa, the Prishtha (stotra in) the Saptadasa, and the Yagñâyagñiya (stotra in) the Ekavimsa (stoma)--they are the tail.
1	2	8	Now these two, the Pañkadasa and Saptadasa, have thirty-two hymn-verses: twenty-five of these are the twenty-five-fold body ; and the seven which remain over are the Parimâd (sâmans), for these are the cattle (or animals), (for) cattle are sporting all around us (pari-mâd )--thus much, then, is the Great Rite: thereby he obtains the Great Rite even in this (Agnishtoma).
1	2	9	And the Hotri recites seven metres--each subsequent one-versed (metre) increasing by four (syllables)--with the Virâg as an eighth: these (eight) consist of three eighties and forty-five syllables. Now by the eighties thereof the eighties (of the mahad uktham)  are obtained, for the Great Litany is counted (or recited) by eighties (of triplets); and of the forty-five (syllables which remain) twenty-five are this twenty-five-fold body ; and where the body is there, indeed, are (included) the head, and the wings and tail; and the twenty (syllables which remain) are the insertion ;--thus much, then, is the Great Litany: thereby he obtains the Great Litany even in this (Agnishtoma). All these (three) are indeed obtained in the Gyotishtoma Agnishtoma: let him, therefore, perform offering with the Gyotishtoma Agnishtoma.
1	3	1	Pragâpati created living beings. From the out- (and in-) breathings he created the gods, and from the downward breathings the mortal beings; andabove the (mortal) beings he created Death as their consumer.
1	3	2	Now, one half of that Pragâpati was mortal, and the other half immortal: with that part of him which was mortal he was afraid of death; and, being afraid, he became twofold, clay and water, and entered this (earth).
1	3	3	Death spake unto the gods saying, 'What has become of him who has created us?'--'Being afraid of thee, he has entered this (earth),' they said. He spake, 'Let us search for him, let us gather him up for I shall not injure him.' The gods gathered him from out of this (earth): that part of him which was in the water, they gathered as water, and that which was in this (earth, they gathered) as clay. Having gathered together both clay and water, they made a brick, whence a brick consists of both clay and water.
1	3	4	And, indeed, these five forms (bodily parts) of him are mortal--the hair on the mouth, the skin, the flesh, the bone, and the marrow; and these are immortal--the mind, the voice, the vital air; the eye, and the ear.
1	3	5	Now, that Pragâpati is no other than the Fire-altar which is here built up, and what five mortal parts there were of him, they are these layers of earth; and those which were immortal they are these layers of bricks.
1	3	6	The gods spake, 'Let us make him immortal!' Having encompassed that mortal form by those immortal forms of his, they made it immortal--the layer of earth by means of two layers of bricks: in like manner the second, the third, and the fourth (layers of earth).
1	3	7	And having laid down the fifth layer (of bricks), he (the Adhvaryu) scatters earth on it; thereon he lays the Vikarnî and the Svayamâtrinnâ, scatters chips of gold, and places the fire: that is the seventh layer, and that (part) is immortal; and in this way, having encompassed that mortal form of his by those two immortal forms, they made it immortal,--the layer of earth by means of two layers of bricks. Thereby, then, Pragâpati became immortal; and in like manner does the Sacrificer become immortal by making that body (of the altar) immortal.
1	3	8	But the gods knew not whether they had made him complete, or not; whether they had made him too large, or left him defective. They saw this verse , 'The seat-hiding Agni, Indra, god Brahman, Brihaspati, and the wise All-gods may speed our sacrifice unto bliss!'
1	3	9	Of this (verse) one part is Agni's, one part Indra's, and one part the All-gods’;--with that part thereof which is Agni's they made up that part of him (Pragâpati) which is Agni's, and with Indra's (part) that which is Indra's, and with the All-gods’ (part) that which is the All-gods’: in this very (fire-altar) they thus made him up wholly and completely.
1	3	10	And when he stands by (the altar, worshipping it) with this (verse), he thereby secures (makes good) all that part of him (Pragâpati) which, whether he knows it or not, he either does in excess or insufficiently in this (fire-altar),--whatever has not been secured for him. The 'seat-hiding' (verse) is an Anushtubh, for the Anushtubh is speech, and the seat-hider is speech: it is by speech that hesecures for him what was not secured for him. 'Let him approach (the altar with this verse) when he has covered a layer with earth,' say some, 'for then that (layer) becomes whole and complete.'
1	4	1	Now, at the beginning, Pragâpati was (composed of) both these, the mortal and the immortal--his vital airs alone were immortal, his body mortal: by this sacrificial performance, and by this order of proceeding, he made his body uniformly undecaying and immortal. And in like manner is the Sacrificer (composed of) both the mortal and the immortal--his vital airs alone are immortal, his body mortal: by this sacrificial performance, and by this order of proceeding, he makes his body uniformly undecaying and immortal.
1	4	2	He lays down the first layer,--this, doubtless, is his out- (and in-) breathing , and it is an immortal (element), for the out-breathing is something immortal: this, then, is an immortal layer. He then scatters loose soil thereon,--this, doubtless, is his marrow, and it is a mortal (element), for the marrow is mortal: he establishes it on that immortal (element), and thereby this part of him becomes immortal.
1	4	3	He lays down the second layer,--this, doubtless, is his downward breathing, and it is an immortal (element), for the downward breathing is something immortal: this, then, is an immortal layer. He thus encompasses that mortal (element) on bothsides by an immortal one, and thereby that part of him becomes immortal. He then scatters loose soil thereon,--this, doubtless, is his bones, and it is a mortal (element), for the bone is mortal: he establishes it on that immortal (element), and thereby this part of him becomes immortal.
1	4	4	He lays down the third layer,--this, doubtless, is his through-breathing , and it is an immortal (element), for the through-breathing is something immortal: this, then, is an immortal layer. He thus encompasses that mortal (element) on both sides by an immortal one, and thereby that part of him becomes immortal. He then scatters loose soil thereon,--this, doubtless, is his sinews, and it is a mortal (element), for the sinew is mortal: he establishes it on that immortal (element), and thereby this part of him becomes immortal.
1	4	5	He lays down the fourth layer,--this, doubtless, is his upward breathing , and it is an immortal (element), for the upward breathing is something immortal: this, then, is an immortal layer. He thus encompasses that mortal (element) on both sides by an immortal one, and thereby that part of him becomes immortal. He then scatters loose soil thereon,--this, doubtless, is his flesh, and it is a mortal (element), for flesh is mortal: he establishes it on that immortal (element), and thereby this part of him becomes immortal.
1	4	6	He lays down the fifth layer,--this, doubtless,is his central (or pervading) breathing , and it is an immortal (element), for the central breathing is something immortal: this, then, is an immortal layer. He thus encompasses that mortal (element) on both sides by an immortal one, and thereby that part of him becomes immortal. He then scatters loose soil thereon,--this, doubtless, is his fat, and it is a mortal (element), for the fat is mortal: he establishes it on that immortal (element), and thereby this part of him becomes immortal.
1	4	7	He lays down the sixth layer,--this, doubtless, is his voice, and it is an immortal (element), for the voice is something immortal: this, then, is an immortal layer. He thus encompasses that mortal (element) on both sides by an immortal one, and thereby that part of him becomes immortal. He then scatters loose soil thereon,--this, doubtless, is his blood and his skin, and it is a mortal (element), for blood is mortal, and skin is mortal: he establishes it on that immortal (element), and thereby this part of him becomes immortal.
1	4	8	These, then, are six layers of bricks, and six layers of earth, that makes twelve,--the year (consists of) twelve months, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much did Pragâpati then make his body uniformly undecaying and immortal; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now make his body uniformly undecaying and immortal.
1	4	9	Having then laid down the Vikarnî and Svayamâtrinnâ, he scatters chips of gold, and placesthe fire thereon: Pragâpati then finally made a golden form for his body; and inasmuch as (he did so) finally, this was the final form of his body; whence people speak of 'the golden Pragâpati .' And in like manner does the Sacrificer now finally make a golden form for his body; and inasmuch as (he does so) finally, this is the final form of his body; and hence, whether they know this or not, people say that the Agnikit (he who has built an altar) is born in yonder world as one made of gold .
1	4	10	Now, on this point, Sândilya and Sâptarathavâhani, teacher and pupil, were once disputing with one another: 'This is his form,' said Sândilya; 'his hair,' said Sâptarathavâhani.
1	4	11	Sândilya said, 'Surely, there is a hairy form (as well as) a hairless form: his form it certainly is;' and this, indeed, is as Sândilya has said: when it (the altar) is completely built, Agni is led forward; and after he has been led forward, logs of wood  are offered as 'oblations.'
1	4	12	By means of (the channel of) the out- (and in-) breathing the gods eat food, and Agni (the sacrificial fire) is the out-breathing of the gods; whence it is in front (of the sacrificial ground) that offering is made to the gods, for by means of the (channel of the) out-breathing the gods eat food. By means of the down-breathing men eat food, whence foodis introduced into men (from the front) towards the back, for by their down-breathing men eat food.
1	4	13	Here, now, they say, 'He who has built an altar must not eat of any bird, for he who builds a fire-altar becomes of a bird's form; he would be apt to incur sickness: the Agnikit therefore must not eat of any bird.' Nevertheless, one who knows this may safely eat thereof; for he who builds an altar becomes of Agni's form, and, indeed, all food here belongs to Agni: whosoever knows this will know that all food belongs to him.
1	4	14	Here, now, they say, 'What is done here in (the building of) the altar, whereby the Sacrificer conquers recurring death?' Well, he who builds an altar becomes the deity Agni; and Agni (the fire), indeed, is the immortal (element);--the gods are splendour: he enters splendour; the gods are glory: he becomes glorious whosoever knows this.
1	5	1	This built fire-altar, in truth, (includes) all these sacrifices:--when he slaughters an animal victim, that is the Agnyâdheya (establishment of the sacred fires) ; when he collects (the materials for) the fire-pan, that constitutes the oblations of the Agnyâdheya; when he performs the initiation,that is the Agnihotra; and when the initiated puts two logs on (the fire) , these are the two oblations of the Agnihotra.
1	5	2	He puts them on in the evening and in the morning, for in the evening and in the morning the Agnihotra oblations are offered;--with one and the same formula, for with one and the same formula the two Agnihotra oblations are offered . Then the driving about (of the fire in the pan ), and the taking down (to the water) of the ashes, these two (constitute) the New and Full-moon offerings; and when he builds the Gârhapatya hearth , that is the Kâturmâsya (seasonal offerings); and what takes place from (the building of) the Gârhapatya up to the (sowing of) all-herb (seed , that constitutes) the ishtis , and what takes place after the all-herb (sowing) and prior to (the buildingof) the layers, that is the animal sacrifices ; and the Vishnu-strides  which are (performed) at these sacrifices are just these Vishnu-strides; and what muttering of formulas there is that is the Vâtsapra .
1	5	3	The first layer is the Soma-sacrifice; the second the Râgasûya as prior to the consecrations ; the third the Vâgapeya; the fourth the Asvamedha (horse-sacrifice); and the fifth the Agnisava . Then the sâmans he sings around the built (altar) are the Mahâvrata(-sâman); the Udgâtri's preliminary muttering (of the text of his chants) on that occasion is the Satarudriya; the 'shower of wealth' the Great Litany; and what takes place subsequent to (the singing of) the sâmans, and prior to the shower of wealth, that is the Hotri's preliminary muttering on that occasion; and what takes place after the shower of wealth is the Grihamedhas  (house-sacrifices). Such are all the sacrifices: these he secures by (building) the fire-altar.
1	5	4	Now, then, as to the powers (conferred by the performance) of sacrifices. Verily, he who (regularly) performs the Agnihotra eats food in the evening and in the morning (when he comes to be) in yonder world, for so much sustenance is there in that sacrifice. And he who performs the New and Full-moon sacrifice (eats food) every half-month; and he who performs the Seasonal sacrifice (does so) every four months; and be who performs the animal sacrifice (twice a year, eats food) every six months; and the Soma-sacrificer once a year; and the builder of the fire-altar at his pleasure eats food every hundred years, or abstains therefrom ; for a hundred years is as much as immortality , unending and everlasting: and, verily, for him who knows this, there shall thus be immortality, unending and everlasting; and whatever he as much as touches, as it were, with a reed, shall be for him immortal, unending and everlasting.
2	1	1	Pragâpati was desirous of going up to the world of heaven; but Pragâpati, indeed, is all the (sacrificial) animals --man, horse, bull, ram, andhe-goat:--by means of these forms he could not do so. He saw this bird-like body, the fire-altar, and constructed it. He attempted to fly up, without contracting and expanding (the wings), but could not do so. By contracting and expanding (the wings) he did fly up: whence even to this day birds can only fly up when they contract their wings and spread their feathers.
2	1	2	He measures it (the fire-altar) by finger-breadths; for the sacrifice being a man , it is by means of him that everything is measured here. Now these, to wit, the fingers, are his lowest measure: he thus secures for him (the sacrificial man ) that lowest measure of his, and therewith he thus measures him.
2	1	3	He measures by twenty-four finger-breadths ,--the  (verse) consists of twenty-four syllables, and Agni is of Gâyatra nature : as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus measures him.
2	1	4	He contracts  (the right wing) inside on bothsides  by just four finger-breadths, and expands  it outside on both sides  by four finger-breadths: he thus expands it by just as much as he contracts it; and thus, indeed, he neither exceeds (its proper size) nor does he make it too small. In the same way in regard to the tail, and in the same way in regard to the left wing.
2	1	5	He then makes two bending-limbs  in the wings, for there are two bending-limbs in a bird'swings. In one-third (of each wing he makes them), for the bending-limbs are in one-third of the bird's wings;--in the inner third , for the bending-limbs are in the inner third of a bird's wings. He expands (each of these limbs) in front  by just four finger-breadths, and contracts it behind by four finger-breadths; he thus expands it by just as much as he contracts it; and thus, indeed, he neither exceeds (its size), nor does he make it too small.
2	1	6	On that bending-limb he places one brick he thereby gives to it that single tube (tubular organ) which joins on to  (the body) from the bending-limb of the flying bird. Then here (on the left wing).
2	1	7	He then makes the wings crooked, for a bird's wings are crooked; he expands them behind by just four finger-breadths, and contracts them in front by four finger-breadths : he thus draws them out byjust as much as he draws them in; and thus, indeed, he neither exceeds (its size) nor does he make it too small.
2	1	8	He now gives to it (the altar) the highest form . This Agni had now been completely restored, and the gods conferred upon him this highest form; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) confer upon him this highest form: he makes a thousand bricks marked with straight lines, a thousand marked this way (from left to right), and a thousand marked that way (from right to left).
2	1	9	And when he has laid down the fifth layer, he measures out the altar in three parts, and on the central part he places the one thousand bricks marked with straight lines: he thereby gives to it those straight plumes of the bird pointing backwards (with their tops, and covering it) from head to tail.
2	1	10	On the right side he then lays down the one thousand (bricks) marked thus (from left to right): he thereby gives to it those curved plumes on the right side of the bird .
2	1	11	On the left side he then lays down the one thousand (bricks) marked thus (from right to left): he thereby gives to it those curved plumes on the left side of the bird. With a thousand (bricks he does it each time)--a thousand means everything:with everything (required) he thus confers that highest form upon him (Agni);--with three thousand--Agni is threefold: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus confers the highest form upon him.
2	2	1	Now the one person which they made out of those seven persons  became this Pragâpati. He produced living beings (or offspring), and having produced living beings he went upwards,--he went to that world where that (sun) now shines. And, indeed, there was then no other (victim) meet for sacrifice but that one (Pragâpati), and the gods set about offering him up in sacrifice.
2	2	2	Wherefore it is with reference to this that the Rishi has said , 'The gods offered up sacrifice by sacrifice,'--for by sacrifice they did offer up him (Pragâpati), the sacrifice;--'these were the first ordinances:'--for these laws were instituted first;--'these powers clung unto the firmament,'--the firmament is the world of heaven, and the powers are the gods: thus, 'Those gods who offered up that sacrifice shall cling to the world of heaven;'--
2	2	3	'Where first the perfect gods were,'--the perfect  gods, doubtless, are the vital airs, for it is they that perfected him in the beginning  when theywere desirous of becoming that (body of Pragâpati ); and even now, indeed, they do perfect (him).----'Thereafter this other became meet for sacrifice by the abundance of the immortal world,'--for thereafter, indeed, other things here--whatsoever is immortal--became fit for sacrifice.
2	2	4	'Savitri's well-winged eagle verily was first born, and he was according to his ordinance,'--the well-winged eagle, doubtless, is Pragâpati, and Savitri is that (sun): thus, 'In accordance with his (the sun's) law he indeed (comported himself).'
2	2	5	He indeed consists of seven persons, for that Person  consisted of seven persons;--to wit, the body of four, and the wings and tail of three, for of four the body of that Person consisted, and of three his wings and tail.
2	2	6	He measures it (the altar) by the man with upstretched arms ; for the sacrifice is a man, and by him everything here is measured; and that is his highest measure when he stands with up-stretched arms: he thus secures for him what is his highest measure, and therewith he then measures it. And what (space) there is over and above that when he is raised on the forepart of his foot, that he secures by the enclosing-stones; and hence heshould dig a line for the enclosing-stones outside (the altar-ground).
2	2	7	Two cubits he gives to the two wings: he thereby lays strength into the wings. And the wings are (the bird's) arms, and by means of the arms food is eaten: it is thus for the sake of food that he gives them that space; and when he gives two cubits to the two wings, it is because food is taken from the distance of a cubit.
2	2	8	To the tail he gives a span: he thus lays strength into the support, for the tail is the support. The span means the hand , and by means of the hand food is eaten: it is thus for the sake of food that he gives it that space; and when he gives a span to the tail, he thereby settles him (Agni) in (the midst of) food; and when he gives less (space) to this (part of the body), it is because he thereby settles him in (the midst of) food . But, indeed, so much does this (the bird's wing) measure, and so much this (the bird's tail), and hence when he thus measures them, it is for the sake of securing for him that (natural measure).
2	3	1	Now this Vedi (altar-ground, viz. the Mahâvedi of the Soma-sacrifice) is just that (right) measure for the Vedi of the sevenfold  (fire-altar). Having fixed upon (the place for) the sacrificial ground, he enters the Patnîsâla  by the front (east) door, and having thrown up (the ground) for the Gârhapatya, he sprinkles it with water. From the raised (site) of the Gârhapatya he strides seven steps eastward. From there he measures off a fathom  towards the east, and having, in the middle thereof, thrown up (the ground) for the Âhavanîya, he sprinkles it with water. From the front part of the fathom he strides three steps eastward: that is the end of the Vedi .
2	3	2	Now, there are here, including the fathom (as one), eleven steps  between the end of the Vedi and the (original) Gârhapatya;--the Trishtubh consistsof eleven syllables, and the Trishtubh is a thunderbolt, and the Trishtubh means strength: it is thus by the thunderbolt, and by strength, that the Sacrificer from the very first drives off the fiends, the Rakshas, from the mouth of the sacrifice.
2	3	3	This is the womb of the Vedi, for it was from that womb that the gods begat the Vedi. And that (space of a) fathom which was (marked off), is the womb of the Gârhapatya , for it was from that womb that the gods begat the Gârhapatya; and from the Gârhapatya the Âhavanîya.
2	3	4	From the (western) end of the Vedi he measures off the Vedi  thirty-six steps long eastward, thirty (steps) broad behind, and twenty-four (steps broad) in front,--that makes ninety. This, then, is the Vedi measuring ninety steps: thereon he lays out the sevenfold Fire-altar.
2	3	5	As to this they say, 'How does this sevenfold (Person, the fire-altar,) correspond to this Vedi (measuring ninety steps)?' Well, there are theseten vital airs in a man , four limbs, and the trunk as the fifteenth; in the same way in the second, and in the same way in the third (man),--in six men this makes ninety; and one man remains over. Now, (that seventh) man is fivefold--hair, skin, flesh, bone, and marrow (fat), and this Vedi also is fivefold--the four regions (quarters), and the body (of the altar) as the fifth : thus this sevenfold (altar) does indeed correspond to this Vedi.
2	3	6	Now, some, intending to construct higher forms (of altars), increase (the number of) these steps and this fathom accordingly, saying, 'We enlarge the womb in accordance therewith;'--but let him not do so; for the womb does not enlarge along with the child that has been born , but, indeed, only as long as the child is within the womb, does the womb enlarge, and so long, indeed, the growth of the (unborn) child here (lasts) .
2	3	7	Indeed, those who do it in that way, deprive this Father Pragâpati of his due proportions; and they will become the worse for sacrificing, for they deprive Father Pragâpati of his due proportions. As large as this Vedi  of the sevenfold (fire-altar) is, fourteen times as large he measures out the Vedi of the one hundred and one-fold (altar).
2	3	8	He now measures off a cord thirty-six steps  (yards) long, and folds it up into seven (equal) parts: of this he covers (the . space of) the three front (eastern) parts (with bricks), and leaves four (parts)  free.
2	3	9	He then measures (a cord) thirty steps long, and lays it sevenfold: of this he covers three parts (with bricks) behind, and leaves four (parts) free .
2	3	10	He then measures (a cord) twenty-four steps long, and lays it sevenfold: of this he covers three parts in front (with bricks), and leaves four (parts) free . This, then, is the measuring out of the Vedi.
2	3	11	Now as to the (other) forms of the fire-altar. Twenty-eight man's lengths long (from west to east) and twenty-eight man's lengths across is the body (of the altar), fourteen man's lengths the right, and fourteen the left wing, and fourteen the tail. Fourteen cubits (aratni) he covers (with bricks) on the right, and fourteen on the left wing, and fourteen spans (vitasti) on the tail. Such is the measure of (an altar of) ninety-eight man's lengths with the additional space (for wings and tail).
2	3	12	He now measures a cord of three man's lengths, and lays it sevenfold: of this he covers (the space of) four parts (with bricks) on the body (of the altar), and three parts on the wings and tail.
2	3	13	He then measures one three cubits long, and lays it sevenfold: of this he covers (the space of) three parts on the right, and three on the left wing, and leaves four (parts) free.
2	3	14	He then measures one a span long, and lays it sevenfold: of this he covers (the space of) three parts on the tail, and leaves four (parts) free. In this way does this one hundred and one-fold (Agni) correspond to this Vedi.
2	3	15	As to this they say, 'When thirteen man's lengths are over, how is it that these do not deviatefrom the right proportions (of the altar) ?' Well, what right proportions there were in the case of that seventh man's length , these same proportions (also apply) to all these (redundant man's lengths).
2	3	16	And they also say, 'When Pragâpati had formed the body he filled it up with these (redundant lengths) wherever there was anything defective in it; and therefore also it is rightly proportioned.
2	3	17	As to this some say, 'The first time they construct a simple (altar ), then the one higher by one (man's length), up to the one of unlimited size.' Let him not do so.
2	3	18	Sevenfold, indeed, Pragâpati was created in the beginning. He went on constructing (developing) his body, and stopped at the one hundred and one-fold one. He who constructs one lower than a sevenfold one cuts this Father Pragâpati in twain: he will be the worse for sacrificing as one would be by doing injury to his better. And he who constructs one exceeding the one hundred and one-fold one steps beyond this universe, for Pragâpati is this universe. Hence he should first construct the sevenfold (altar), then the next higher up to the one hundred and one-fold one, but he should not construct one exceeding the one hundred and one-foldone, and thus, indeed, he neither cuts this Father Pragâpati in twain, nor does he step beyond this universe.
2	4	1	Pragâpati, indeed, is the year, and Agni is all objects of desire. This Pragâpati, the year, desired, 'May I build up for myself a body so as to contain  Agni, all objects of desire.' He constructed a body one hundred and one-fold; and in constructing a body one hundred and one-fold, he built up for himself a body so as to contain Agni, all objects of desire, and himself became all objects of desire; there was not one object of desire outside of him: whence they say, 'The year (includes) all objects of desire;' for, indeed, outside the year there is no object of desire whatever.
2	4	2	And in like manner does the Sacrificer now, by constructing a body (of the altar) one hundred and one-fold, build for himself a body so as to contain Agni, all objects of desire: he becomes all objects of desire, and not one object of (his) desire is outside of him.
2	4	3	Now this year is the same as yonder sun; and he is this one hundred and one-fold (Agni);--his rays are a hundredfold, and he himself who shinesyonder, being the one hundred and first, is firmly established in this universe; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now establish himself in this universe by constructing for himself a body a hundred and one-fold.
2	4	4	And, indeed, the one hundred and one-fold passes into (becomes equal to) the sevenfold one; for yonder sun, whilst composed a hundred and one-fold, is established in the seven worlds of the gods, for, indeed, there are seven worlds of the gods,--the four quarters and these three worlds: these are the seven worlds of the gods, and in them that (sun) is established. And in like manner does the Sacrificer now establish himself in the seven worlds of the gods by constructing for himself a body a hundred and one-fold.
2	4	5	And, again, as to how the one hundred and one-fold (altar) passes into the sevenfold one:--yonder sun, composed of a hundred and one parts, is established in the seven seasons, in the seven stomas (hymn-forms), in the seven prishtha (-sâmans), in the seven metres, in the seven vital airs, and in the seven regions; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now establish himself in this universe (or, on everything here) by constructing for himself a body one hundred and one-fold.
2	4	6	And, again, as to how the one hundred and one-fold passes into the sevenfold one:--yonder sun, composed of a hundred and one parts, is established in the seven-syllabled Brahman, for the Brahman (holy writ or prayer) indeed consists of seven syllables,--'rik' is one syllable, 'yaguh' two, and 'sâma' two; and what other Brahman there is that is just the 'brahman' of two syllables--thisseven-syllabled Brahman is the universe : therein that (sun) is established; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now establish himself in the seven-syllabled Brahman by constructing for himself a body one hundred and one-fold.
2	4	7	Therefore, also, they lay down around (the altar) sets of seven (bricks) each time, and hence the one hundred and one-fold passes into the sevenfold one; and, indeed, the sevenfold one passes into the one hundred and one-fold.
2	4	8	Sevenfold, indeed, Pragâpati was created in the beginning. He saw this body composed of a hundred and one parts--fifty bricks in the Prânabhrits , and fifty sacrificial formulas, that makes a hundred, and the 'settling' and sûdadohas-formula are the two one hundred and first--these two are one and the same, for when he has 'settled' (a brick), he pronounces the sûdadohas-formula over it: by means of this one hundred and one-fold body he gained that conquest and obtained that success; and in like manner does the Sacrificer, by means of this one hundred and one-fold body, gain that conquest and obtain that success. And thus, indeed, the sevenfold (altar) passes into the one hundred and one-fold: that which is a hundred and one-fold is sevenfold, and that which is sevenfold is a hundred and one-fold. So much as to the forms (of altars).
2	5	1	Now as to the building itself. He builds between the two (performances of the) Upasads . For at that time the gods were afraid lest the fiends, the Rakshas, should destroy that (Agni's body) of theirs (built) there . They saw these strongholds, the Upasads, to wit, these worlds, for these worlds are indeed strongholds. They entered them, and having entered them, they completed that body in a place free from danger and devilry; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now, after entering these strongholds, complete this body in a place free from danger and devilry.
2	5	2	And, again, as to why he builds between the Upasads. At this time the gods were afraid lest the fiends, the Rakshas, should destroy that (Agni's body) of theirs (built) there. They saw these thunderbolts, the Upasads, for the Upasads indeed are thunderbolts: they entered them , and, having entered them, they completed that body in a place free from danger and devilry; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now, after entering those thunderbolts,complete this body (of Agni) in a place free from danger and devilry.
2	5	3	And the Upasads also are the fervour  in the sacrifice, for they are indeed fervour; and inasmuch as it is built (ki) in fervour (tapas) it is called 'Tâpaskita .' As long as they perform the Upasads so long (do they perform) the Pravargya : (if) it is for a year. that they perform the Upasads, it is for a year (they perform) the Pravargya.
2	5	4	The Upasads, indeed, are the days and nights, and the Pravargya is the sun: he thus establishes yonder sun on the days and nights, whence he is established on the days and nights.
2	5	5	And 'if there are twenty-four (Upasad-days ), there being twenty-four half moons--the Upasadsare the half-moons, and the Pravargya is the sun: he thus establishes yonder sun on the half-moons, whence he is established on the half-moons.
2	5	6	And if there are twelve (Upasad-days) --there being twelve months--the Upasads are the months, and the Pravargya is the sun: he thus establishes yonder sun on the months, whence he is established on the months.
2	5	7	And if there are six (Upasad-days)--there being six seasons--the Upasads are the seasons, and the Pravargya is the sun: he thus establishes yonder sun in the seasons, whence he is established in the seasons.
2	5	8	And if there are three (Upasad-days)--there being these three worlds--the Upasads are these three worlds, and the Pravargya is the sun: he thus establishes yonder sun in these worlds, whence he is established in these worlds.
2	5	9	Now, then, the inquiry as to the earth-layers of the altar-pile. One month (the building of) the first layer (of bricks takes), and one month the layer of earth ,--so long desire (lasts) in the spring season (of two months): he thus  builds for himself a body so as to obtain all of whatever desire there is in the spring season .
2	5	10	One month the second (layer of bricks takes), and one month the layer of earth,--so long desire (lasts) in the summer season: he thus builds for himself a body so as to obtain all of whatever desire there is in the summer season.
2	5	11	One month the third (layer of bricks takes), and one month the layer of earth,--so long desire (lasts) in the rainy season: he thus builds for himself a body so as to obtain all of whatever desire there is in the rainy reason.
2	5	12	One month the fourth (layer of bricks takes), and one month the layer of earth,--so long desire (lasts) in the autumn season: he thus builds for himself a body so as to obtain all of whatever desire there is in the autumn season.
2	5	13	And of the fifth layer (of bricks) he lays down the Asapatnâ and Virâg (bricks) on the first day, and of the Stomabhâgâs one each day: these he 'settles' together once, and pronounces once the sûdadohas-formula over them . For a month they silently apply the earth-layer for the Stomabhâgâs, for so long desire (lasts) in the winter season: thus he builds for himself a body so as to obtain all of whatever desire there is in the winter season.
2	5	14	One month the sixth (layer of bricks takes),and one month the layer of earth,--so long desire (lasts) in the dewy season: he thus builds for himself a body so as to obtain all of whatever desire there is in the dewy season. So long, indeed, desire (lasts) in the twelve months and the six seasons: he thus builds for himself a body so as to obtain all of whatever desire there is in the twelve months and the six seasons.
2	5	15	And in addition to these there are three days , to wit, the day on which he performs the Satarudriya offering, the day of preparation, and the day on which the Soma is pressed. When they perform the Upasad on these days, these (days) are the days and nights of that (thirteenth, or intercalary) month: and when (they perform) the Pravargya, he thereby establishes yonder sun also in that (seventh) season,--so long, indeed, desire (lasts) in the thirteen months and the seven seasons: he thus builds for himself a body so as to obtain all of whatever desire there is in thirteen months and seven seasons.
2	5	16	For a year Soma should be pressed,--the year is everything, and the one hundred and one-fold (altar) is everything: by means of everything he thus gains everything. Should he be unable (to press Soma) for a year, he should perform the Visvagit Atirâtra  with all the Prishthas , and at that (sacrifice) he should give away all his property ; for the Visvagit (all-conquering) Atirâtra with all the Prishthas means everything, and all one's property means everything, and the one hundred and one-fold (altar) means everything: by means of everything he thus gains everything.
2	6	1	The one hundred and one-fold Pragâpati, doubtless, is the year, and thereto belong days andnights, half-months, months, and seasons. The days and nights of a month are sixty, and in the month, doubtless, the days and nights of the year are obtained; and there are twenty-four half-months, thirteen months, and three seasons (of four months)--that makes a hundred parts, and the year itself is the one hundred and first part.
2	6	2	By the seasons it is sevenfold,--six seasons (of two months), and the year itself as the seventh part. And he who shines yonder is the light of that year: his rays are a hundredfold, and the (sun's) disk itself is the one hundred and first part.
2	6	3	By the regions it is sevenfold,--the rays which are in the eastern region are one part, and those in the southern are one, and those in the western are one, and those in the northern are one, and those in the upper (region) are one, and those in the lower (region) are one, and the disk itself is the seventh part.
2	6	4	Beyond this (year) lies the wish-granting world; but the wish-granting one is the immortal (element): it is thus the immortal that lies beyond this (year, temporal existence); and that same immortal (element) is that very light which shines yonder.
2	6	5	Now that same boon (the immortal light), bright with wealth, he, Savitri (the sun), distributes among the distributed creatures, and among plants and trees, too; and to some, indeed, he gives more of it, and to some less; and they to whom he gives more of it live longest, and they to whom he gives less live less long.
2	6	6	It is regarding this that it is said in the Rik , 'The distributer of wealth, the bright boon, we invoke, Savitri, the beholder of men.' And that is the full (measure of) life, for it is long, it is unending ; and when people here say, 'May thy life be long! mayest thou reach the full (extent of) life!' it is as much as to say, 'May that, world, may that (immortal light) be thine!'
2	6	7	It is Vâk (Speech) that, seeing it, speaks (thus). That same (immortal light), indeed, is to be obtained either by the one hundred and one-fold (altar), or by a life of a hundred years: whosoever builds a one hundred and one-fold (altar), or whosoever lives a hundred years, he, indeed, obtains that immortality. Therefore, whether they know it, or whether they do not, people say, 'The life of a hundred years makes for heaven.' Hence one ought not to yield to his own desire and pass away before (he has attained) the full extent of life, for (such shortening of one's life) does not make for the heavenly world ; and these are indeed the worlds, to wit, the days and nights, the half-moons, moons, and seasons, and the year.
2	6	8	Those who pass away in the years below twenty are consigned to the days and nights as their worlds; and those who (pass away) in the years above twenty and below forty, to the half-moons; and those who (pass away) in the (years) above forty and below sixty, to the months; and those who (pass away) in the (years) above sixty and beloweighty, to the seasons; and those who (pass away) in the (years) above eighty and below a hundred (are consigned) to the year; and he alone who lives a hundred years or more attains to that immortal (life).
2	6	9	Only by many sacrifices, indeed, is a single day, or a single night (of life) gained; and only he who builds the one hundred and one-fold (altar), or he who lives a hundred years, is certain of his attaining to that immortal (life). But he, indeed, builds a one hundred and one-fold (altar) who carries him (Ukhya Agni) for a year: hence one should only build (an altar for) such an (Agni) who has been carried for a year. Thus much as to the deity.
2	6	10	Now as to the sacrifice. When he measures out those one hundred and one men (man's lengths) with upstretched arms, that is a one hundred and one-fold (altar) in form, and a sevenfold one in respect of its layers: the layers contain six seasonal  (bricks) and the fire (or altar) itself is the seventh form.
2	6	11	And, indeed, it is a hundred and one-fold in respect of bricks,--the first fifty bricks and the last fifty  which are (laid down) make a hundred forms (parts); and the bricks which are laid down between (those two sets) are the one hundred and first form.
2	6	12	And, having the Yagus for its light, it is a hundred and one-fold in respect of the Yagus (formulas),--the first fifty and the last fifty which are (used) make a hundred forms; and the Yagus which are used between them are the one hundred and first form. In this way also the sevenfold one becomes a hundred and one-fold, and whosoever knows this obtains even by the sevenfold one whatever wish there is both in a life of a hundred years and in the one hundred and one-fold (altar).
2	6	13	In this way, indeed, all sacrifices  up to the Agnihotra are a hundred and one-fold by way of verses, formulas, words, syllables, rites, and hymn-tunes; and whosoever knows this obtains by every sacrifice whatever wish there is either in a life of a hundred years, or in the one hundred and one-fold (altar), or in the sevenfold one. Thus much as to the sacrifice.
2	6	14	Now as to the body. There are these four sets of five fingers and toes, the two--wrist and elbow ,--the arm, the shoulder-blade, and the collarbone,--that makes twenty-five; and in the same way (each of) these other limbs,--that makes a hundred parts, and the trunk itself is the one hundred and first part. As regards the sevenfold state this has been explained .
2	6	15	And, having the vital air for its light, it is a hundred and one-fold by the vital airs limb by limb, for there is vital air in each limb: whosoever knows this obtains, even by his knowledge, whatever wish there is in a life of a hundred years, or in the one hundred and one-fold (altar), or in the sevenfold one, or in all sacrifices; for he has obtained a body perfected by all the sacrifices.
2	6	16	Now, there are these three fivefold (objects), the year, the fire, and man: their five forms are food, drink, well-being , light, and immortality. Whatever food there is in the year, that is its food; whatever water, that is its drink; its well-being is the night, for in the night, as in well-being (contentment or goodness), all beings dwell together ; its light is the day, and its immortal element the sun. Thus much as to the deity.
2	6	17	Now as to the sacrifice. Whatever food is placed on the fire, that is its food, and whatever water, that is its water; its well-being is the enclosing-stones, for they are of the nature of nights ; its light the (bricks) with special formulas, for they are of the nature of days; and its immortalelement the fire, for that is of the nature of the sun. Thus much as to the sacrifice.
2	6	18	Now as to the body. Whatever food there is in man, that is his food; whatever water, that is his water; his well-being (safety, strength) is the bones, for they are of the nature of enclosing-stones; his light the marrow, for that is of the nature of the yagushmatî (bricks); his immortal element the breath, for that is of the nature of fire;--and, indeed, people say, 'The breath is fire, the breath is the immortal.'
2	6	19	Now, hunger ceases through food, thirst through drink, evil through well-being (goodness), darkness through light, and death through immortality; and, in truth, whosoever knows this from him all these pass away, and he conquers recurring death, and attains the whole (perfect) life. And let him hold this to be immortality in yonder world and life here below. Some, indeed, hold it to be breath, saying, 'The breath is fire, the breath is the immortal;' but let him not believe this, for something uncertain is breath. And regarding this it has also been said in the Yagus , 'That (bond) of thine I unloose, as from the middle of Âyus (life):' let him therefore hold it to be immortality in yonder world, and life here below, and thus, indeed, he attains the whole life.
3	1	1	The Gâyatrî is the breath (of Pragâpati, the altar), the Ushnih the eye, the Anushtubh the voice, the Brihatî the mind, the Paṅkti the ear; the Trishtubh is that generative breath; and the Gagatîthat downward breathing;--these are the seven metres increasing by four (syllables) each , which are produced in Agni (the fire-altar).
3	1	2	'The Gâyatrî is the breath,'--thus, whatever power, whatever vigour there is in the breath that is this one thousand; and to the breath, indeed, this vigour belongs; for were the breath of him who builds it to pass away, this fire-altar, assuredly, would not be built: by this its form that (altar) becomes built (so as to contain) a thousand Gâyatrîs.
3	1	3	'The Ushnih is the eye,'--thus, whatever power, whatever vigour there is in the eye that is this one thousand; and to the eye, indeed, this vigour belongs, for were the eye-sight of him who builds it to pass away, this fire-altar, assuredly, would not be built: by this its form that (altar) becomes built (so as to contain) a thousand Ushnihs.
3	1	4	'The Anushtubh is the voice,'--thus, whatever power, whatever vigour there is in the voice that is this one thousand; and to the voice, indeed, this vigour belongs, for were the voice of him who builds it to pass away, this fire-altar, assuredly, would not be built: by this its form that (altar) becomes built (so as to contain) a thousand Anushtubhs.
3	1	5	'The Brihatî is the mind,'--thus, whatever power, whatever vigour there is in the mind that is this one thousand; and to the mind, indeed, this vigour belongs, for were the mind of him who builds it to pass away, this fire altar, assuredly,would not be built: by this its form that (altar) becomes built (so as to contain) a thousand Brihatîs.
3	1	6	'The Paṅkti is the ear,'--thus, whatever power, whatever vigour there is in the ear that is this one thousand; and to the ear, indeed, this vigour belongs, for were the power of hearing of him who builds it to pass away, this fire-altar, assuredly, would not be built: by this its form that (altar) becomes built (so as to contain) a thousand Paṅktis.
3	1	7	'The Trishtubh is that generative (life-giving) breath,'--thus, whatever power, whatever vigour there is in that breath, that is this one thousand; and to that breath, indeed, this vigour belongs, for were that breath of him who builds it to become disordered, this fire-altar, assuredly, would not be built: by this its form that (altar) becomes built (so as to contain) a thousand Trishtubhs.
3	1	8	'And the Gagatî is that downward breathing,'--thus, whatever power, whatever vigour there is in that breathing, that is this one thousand; and to that breathing, indeed, this vigour belongs, for were that breathing of him who builds it to become disordered, this fire-altar, assuredly, would not be built: by this its form that (altar) becomes built (so as to include) a thousand Gagatîs.
3	1	9	Now, these seven metres which increase by four (syllables) successively, and are firmly established in one another, are those seven vital airs  in man, firmly established in one another: thus, byas much as the number of metres he utters has that (altar) of him who knows this, prayers uttered upon it in metre after metre, or hymns chanted, or sastras recited, or (bricks) laid down upon it.
3	2	1	As to this they say, 'What metre and what deity are the head of the fire-altar?' The metre Gâyatrî and the deity Agni are its head.
3	2	2	'What metre and what deity are its neck?' The metre Ushnih and the deity Savitri are its neck.
3	2	3	'What metre and what deity are its spine?' The metre Brihatî and the deity Brihaspati are its spine.
3	2	4	'What metre and what deity are its wings?' The metres Brihat and Rathantara and the deities Heaven and Earth are its wings.
3	2	5	'What metre and what deity are its waist?' The metre Trishtubh and the deity Indra are its waist.
3	2	6	'What metre and what deity are its hips?' The metre Gagatî and the deity Âditya (the sun) are its hips.
3	2	7	'What metre and what deity are the vital air whence the seed flows?' The metre Atikhandas and the deity Pragâpati.
3	2	8	'What metre and what deity are that downward vital air?' The metre Yagñâyagñiya and the deity Vaisvânara.
3	2	9	'What metre and what deity are the thighs?' The metre Anushtubh and that deity, the Visvedevâh, are the thighs.
3	2	10	'What metre and what deity are the knees?' The metre Paṅkti and that deity, the Maruts, are the knees.
3	2	11	'What metre and what deity are the feet?' The metre Dvipadâ and the deity Vishnu are the feet.
3	2	12	'What metre and what deity are the vital airs?' The metre Vikhandas and the deity Vâyu (the wind) are the vital airs.
3	2	13	'What metre and what deity are the defective and redundant parts?' The metre (of the verse) wanting a syllable (or syllables) and that deity, the waters, are the defective and redundant parts. This, then, is the knowledge of the body (of the altar), and suchlike is the deity that enters into this body; and, indeed, there is in this (sacrificial performance) no other prayer for the obtainment of heavenly bliss
3	3	1	Dhîra Sâtaparneya once on a time repaired to Mahâsâla  Gâbâla. He said to him, 'Knowing what , hast thou come to me?'--'Agni (the fire) I know.'--'What Agni knowest thou?'--'Speech.'--'What becomes of him who knows that Agni?'--'He becomes eloquent ,' he said, 'speech does not fail him.'
3	3	2	'Thou knowest Agni,' he said; 'knowing what (else) hast thou come to me?'--'Agni I know.'--'What Agni knowest thou?'--'The Eye.'--'What becomes of him who knows that Agni?'--'He becomes seeing,' he said; his eye does not fail him.'
3	3	3	'Thou knowest Agni,' he said; 'knowing what hast thou come to me?'--'Agni I know.'--'What Agni knowest thou?'--'The Mind.'--'What becomes of him who knows that Agni?'--'He becomes thoughtful,' he said; 'his mind does not fail him.'
3	3	4	'Thou knowest Agni,' he said; 'knowing what hast thou come to me?'--'Agni I know.'--'What Agni knowest thou?'--'The Ear.'--'What becomes of him who knows that Agni?'--'He becomes hearing,' he said; 'his ear does not fail him.'
3	3	5	'Thou knowest Agni,' he said; 'knowing what hast thou come to me?'--'Agni I know.'--'What Agni knowest thou?'--'The Agni who is everything here, him I know.'--On (hearing) this said, he stepped down to him and said, 'Teach me that Agni, sir!'
3	3	6	He said,--Verily, that Agni is the breath; for when man sleeps, speech passes into the breath, and so do the eye, the mind, and the ear; and when he awakes, they again issue from the breath. Thus much as to the body.
3	3	7	Now as to the deity. That speech verily is Agni himself; and that eye is yonder sun; and thatmind is that moon; and that ear is the quarters; and that breath is the wind that blows here.
3	3	8	Now, when that fire goes out, it is wafted up in the wind (air), whence people say of it, 'It has expired ,' for it is wafted up in the wind. And when the sun sets it enters the wind, and so does the moon; and the quarters are established in the wind, and from out of the wind they issue again. And when he who knows this passes away from this world, he passes into the fire by his speech, into the sun by his eye, into the moon by his mind, into the quarters by his ear, and into the wind by his breath; and being composed thereof, he becomes whichever of these deities he chooses, and is at rest.
3	4	1	Svetaketu Âruneya , once upon a time, was about to offer sacrifice. His father said to him, 'What priests hast thou chosen to officiate?' He said, 'This Vaisvâvasavya here is my Hotri.' He asked him, 'Knowest thou, Brâhmana Vaisvâvasavya,--
3	4	2	The four great (things)?'--'I know them, sir,' he said.--'Knowest thou the four great ones of the great?'--'I know them, sir,' he said.--'Knowest thou the four rites (vrata)?'--'I know them, sir,' he said.--'Knowest thou the four rites of rites?'--'I know them, sir,' he said.--'Knowest thou thefour relating to Ka ?'--'I know them, sir,' he said.--'Knowest thou the four deepest of those relating to Ka ?'--'I know them, sir,' he said.--'Knowest thou the four flames ?'--'I know them, sir,' he said.--'Knowest thou the four flames of flames?'--'I know them, sir,' he said.
3	4	3	'Knowest thou the Arka ?'--'Nay, but thou wilt teach us , sir!'--'Knowest thou the two Arka-leaves?'--'Nay, but thou wilt teach us, sir!'--'Knowest thou the two Arka-flowers?'--'Nay, but thou wilt teach us, sir!'--'Knowest thou the two pod-leaves  of the Arka?'--'Nay, but thou wilt teach us, sir!'--Knowest thou the two coops  of the Arka?'--'Nay, but thou wilt teach us, sir!'--'Knowest thou the Arka-grains?'--'Nay, but thou wilt teach us, sir!'--'Knowest thou the bulge  ofthe Arka?'--'Nay, but thou wilt teach us, sir!'--'Knowest thou the root of the Arka?'--'Nay, but thou wilt teach us, sir!'
3	4	4	Now, when he said, 'Knowest thou the four great (things)? Knowest thou the four great of the great?'--the great one is Agni (the fire), and the great (thing) of that great one are the plants and trees, for they are his food; and the great one is Vâyu (the wind), and the great (thing) of that great one are the waters, for they are his (the wind's) food; and the great one is Âditya (the sun), and the great (thing) of that great one is the moon, for that is his food; and the great one is Man, and the great (thing) of that great one is cattle, for they are his food:--these are the four great things, these the four great of the great;--these are the four rites, these the four rites of rites;--these are the four relating to Ka, these the four deepest relating to Ka;--these are the four flames, these the four flames of flames.
3	4	5	And when he said, 'Knowest thou the Arka?' he thereby meant man;--'Knowest thou the two Arka-leaves?' he thereby meant his ears;--'Knowest thou the two Arka-flowers?' he thereby meant his eyes;--'Knowest thou the pod-leaves of the Arka?' he thereby meant his nostrils;--'Knowest thou the two coops of the Arka?' he thereby meant his lips;--'Knowest thou the Arka-grains?' he thereby meant his teeth;--'Knowest thou the bulge of the Arka?' he thereby meant his tongue;--'Knowest thou the root of the Arka?'he thereby meant his food. Now that Arka, to wit, man, is Agni; and verily, whoso regards Agni as the Arka and the man, in his (altar-) body that Agni, the Arka, will be built up even through the knowledge that 'I here am Agni, the Arka.'
3	5	1	Now, the Yagus, indeed, is he who blows here, for even whilst passing along he (Vâyu, the wind) generates (vivifies) everything here, and after him passing along everything is generated: this is why the Yagus is no other than Vâyu.
3	5	2	And the course  (gûh) is this space, to wit, this air , for along this space it (the wind) courses; and the Yagus is both the wind and the air--the 'yat' and the 'gûh'--whence (the name) Yagus. And the 'yat' (that which goes) is this (Adhvaiyu) , for when he 'goes' on (performing), the Rik and Sâman carry that Yagus established on the Rik and Sâman. Hence the Adhvaryu performs his work with the very same Grahas (cups of Soma), (while) there are each time  different stotras (chants) and sastras (recitations): it is just as if, after driving with a first pair (of horses), one drives with a second pair.
3	5	3	Now Agni is in front  (puras), for placing Agni in front (of them) these creatures attend upon him; and the sun is motion (karana), for as soon as he rises everything here moves about. Such is the Yagus with the preparatory performance (puraskarana ) as regards the deities.
3	5	4	Now as regards the body. The Yagus is the breath, for whilst moving (yat) it generates (vivifies) everything here, and along with the moving breath birth takes place here: hence the Yagus is the breath.
3	5	5	And this course (gûh) is space--this space which is inside the body--for along this space it (the breath) courses; and the Yagus is both the breath and space,--the 'yat' and the 'gûh': hence 'yagus.' And the 'yat' (moving) is the breath, for the breath moves.
3	5	6	The Yagus, indeed, is food, for by food one is produced, and by food one moves. And food carries along that Yagus established on food, whence even different food is introduced into the same (channel of the) breath.
3	5	7	And the Mind is in front (puras), for the mind is the first of vital airs; and the eye is motion (karana), for it is in accordance with the eye that thisbody moves. Such is the Yagus with the preparatory performance, firmly established both as regards the deity and the body; and, indeed, whosoever thus knows this Yagus with the preparatory performance to be firmly established both as regards the deity and the body,--
3	5	8	He, indeed, reaches successfully the end of the sacrifice, unscathed and uninjured: he who knows this becomes the first, the leader (pura-etri), of his own people, an eater of food (i.e. prosperous), and a ruler.
3	5	9	And if any one strives to become a rival  among his own people to one who knows this, he does not satisfy his dependants; but, indeed, only he satisfies his dependants, who is faithful  to that one and who, along with him, strives to support his dependants.
3	5	10	And this is the greatest Brahman (n., mystic science), for than this there is no thing greater; and, he who knows this, being himself the greatest, becomes the highest among his own people.
3	5	11	This Brahman has nothing before it and nothing after it ; and whosoever thus knows this Brahman to have nothing before it and nothingafter it, than he there is no one higher among his equals in station; and ever higher will be the descendants that spring from him. Wherefore, if any one would be greater than he, let him reverentially approach the regions in front (to the eastward) of that one in this way, and he will do him no injury .
3	5	12	But, indeed, the mystic import (upanishad) is the essence of this Yagus; and thus, if, with ever so small a yagus-formula, the Adhvaryu draws a cup of Soma, that (essence) is equal to both the Stotra and the Sastra, and comes up to both the Stotra and the Sastra: hence, however small the essence (flavour) of food, it benefits (renders palatable) the whole food, and pervades the whole food.
3	5	13	Satiation (contentment), doubtless, is the successful issue thereof (to wit, of food, and the Yagus): hence when one is satiated by food he feels like one who has succeeded. And joy, the knowledge thereof (viz. of the essence, the mystic import), is its soul (self); and, assuredly, all the gods are of joyful soul; and this, the true knowledge, belongs to the gods alone,--and, indeed, whosoever knows this is not a man, but one of the gods.
3	5	14	And Priyavrata Rauhinâyana, knowing this (truth), once spake unto the blowing wind, 'Thy soul  is joy: blow thou either hither or thither!' and so, indeed, it now blows. Wherefore, if one desire to invoke any blessing from the gods, let him approach them with this, 'Your soul is joy,--my wish is such and such: let it be fulfilled unto me!' and whatever the wish he entertains, it will be fulfilled to him; for, assuredly, he who knows this attains this contentment, this successful issue, this joy, this soul.
3	5	15	This Yagus is silent , indistinct; for the Yagus is the breath, and the breath is of silent (secret) abode; and if any one were to say of that (Adhvaryu) who pronounces (the Yagus) distinctly, 'He has uttered distinctly the indistinct deity: his breath shall fail him!' then that would, indeed, come to pass.
3	5	16	And, assuredly, he who knows the indistinct (secret) manifestation of this (Yagus) becomes manifest in fame and glory. Silently the Adhvaryu draws the cup of Soma with the (muttered) Yagus, and, when drawn and deposited, it becomes manifest;--silently he builds the fire-altar with the Yagus, and, when built and completed, it becomes manifest;--silently he takes out (material for) the oblation with the Yagus, and, when cooked and ready (for offering), it becomes manifest: thus, whatever he performs silently, when performed and completed, it becomes manifest. And, assuredly, he who thus knows this secret manifestation of this (Yagus) becomes manifest in fame, and glory, and sanctity; and quickly, indeed, he becomes known: he becomes the Yagus itself, and by the Yagus people call him .
4	1	1	When the gods restored the relaxed Pragâpati, they poured him, as seed, into the fire-pan (ukhâ) as the womb, for the fire-pan is a womb In the course of a year they prepared for him this food, to wit, the fire-altar built here, and enclosed it in a body; and, being enclosed in a body, it became the body itself; whence food, when enclosed in a body, becomes the body itself.
4	1	2	In like manner does the Sacrificer now pour his own self (or body), as seed, into the fire-pan as the womb, for the fire-pan is a womb. In the course of a year he prepares for it (his self) this food, to wit, the fire-altar here built, and encloses it in a body, and, being enclosed in a body, it becomes the body itself; whence food, when enclosed in a body, becomes the body itself.
4	1	3	He places him (the Ukhya Agni, on the fire-altar) with 'Vaushat !' for 'vauk' is he (Agni),and 'shat (six)' is this six-layered food: having prepared it, he offers it to him as proportionate to this body, for food which is proportionate to the body satisfies, and does not injure it; but when there is too much, it does injure it, and when there is too little, it does not satisfy it.
4	1	4	Now that Arka  (flame) is this very fire which they bring here; and the Kya  is this his food, to wit, the fire-altar built here: that (combined) makes the Arkya  in respect of the Yagus. And the Great one (mahân) is this (Agni), and this vrata  (rite) is his food: that makes the Mahâvrata (sâman) in respect of the Sâman. And 'uk' is this (Agni), and 'tha' his food,--that (combined) makes the Uktha (sastra, recitation)  in respect of the Rik. Thus, whilst being only one, this is accounted threefold.
4	1	5	Now Indra and Agni were created as the Brahman (priesthood) and the Kshatra (nobility): the Brahman was Agni and the Kshatra Indra. When created, the two were separate. They spake, 'Whilst being thus, we shall be unable to produce creatures (people): let us both become one form!' The two became one form.
4	1	6	Now those two, Indra and Agni, are the same as these two, to wit, the gold plate and the (gold) man : Indra is the gold plate, and Agni the man. They are made of gold: gold means light, and Indra and Agni are the light; gold means immortal life, and Indra and Agni mean immortal life.
4	1	7	It is these two, Indra and Agni, that they build up. Whatever is of brick that is Agni: whence they bake that (part) by fire, and all that is baked by fire is Agni. And what filling of earth there is (in the altar) that. is Indra: whence they do not bake that (part) by fire, lest it should be Agni, and not Indra. Thus it is these two, Indra and Agni, that are built up.
4	1	8	And the two become that one form, to wit, the fire which is placed on the built (altar), and hence those two, by means of that form, produce creatures. Now Agni, indeed, is this single brick , and into this the whole Agni passes: this, indeed, is the perfection of bricks,--it is that one syllable (akshara) 'vauk,' it is this into which the whole Agni passes, and which is the perfection of syllables.
4	1	9	It is this that the Rishi saw when he said, 'I praise what hath been and what will be, the Great Brahman, the one Akshara,--the manifold Brahman, the one Akshara; for, indeed, all the gods, all beings pass into that Akshara (imperishableelement ): it is both the Brahman and the Kshatra; and the Brahman is Agni, and the Kshatra Indra; and the Visve Devâh (all the gods) are Indra and Agni. But the Visve Devâh (the All-gods) are also the peasantry: hence it is Priesthood, Nobility, and Peasantry.
4	1	10	And, indeed, Syâparna Sâyakâyana, knowing this, once said, 'If this my sacrificial performance were complete, my own race would become the kings (nobles), Brâhmanas, and peasants of the Salvas; but even by that much of my work which has been completed  my race will surpass the Salvas in both ways;'--for this (Agni, the fire-altar), indeed, is (social) eminence and fame, and an eater of food .
4	1	11	And regarding this, Sândilya, having instructed Vâmakakshâyana , said, 'Thou wilt become eminent, famous, and an eater of food (rich);' and, indeed, he who knows this becomes eminent, famous, and an eater of food.
4	1	12	And this Agni is no other than Pragâpati. The gods, having restored this Agni-Pragâpati, in the course of a year prepared this food for him, to wit, this Mahâvratîya cup of Soma.
4	1	13	The Adhvaryu draws it by means of a cup, and inasmuch as he draws (grah) it it is (called) a draught (graha, cup of Soma). The Udgâtri (chanter), by the Mahâvrata (sâman), puts flavour (vital sap) into it; and the Mahâvrata (sâman) being (composed of) all those (five) sâmans, he thus puts flavour into it by means of all sâmans (hymn-tunes). The Hotri puts flavour into it by means of the Great Recitation; and the Great Recitation being (composed of) all those Rik-verses: he thus puts flavour into it by all the Rik-verses.
4	1	14	And when they chant the hymn, and he (the Hotri) afterwards recites (the sastra) , he (the Adhvaryu) offers that (cup of Soma) to him (Agni-Pragâpati) as the Vashat-call is uttered. Now 'vauk' is this (Agni), and 'shat' this sixfold food : having prepared it, he offers it to him as proportionate to his body; for food which is proportionate to the body satisfies, and does not injure it; but when there is too much, it does injure it, and when there is too little, it does not satisfy it.
4	1	15	Now that Arka (flame) is this very fire-altarbuilt here; and the Kya is this his food, to wit, the Mahâvratîya-graha: that (combined) makes the Arkya in respect of the Yagus. And the Great one (mahân) is this (Agni), and this rite (vrata) is his food: that makes the Mahâvrata in respect of the Sâman. And 'uk' is this (Agni), and 'tha' his food: that makes the (Mahad) Uktha in respect of the Rik. Thus, whilst being only one, this is accounted threefold.
4	1	16	And this Agni is Pragâpati, the year : the Sâvitra (oblations) are one half thereof, and the Vaisva-karmana (oblations)  the (other) half; the Sâvitra are eight digits (kalâ ) thereof, and the Vaisvakarmana (the other) eight; and that which is performed between them is the seventeenfold Pragâpati. Now what a digit is to men that a syllable (akshara) is to the gods.
4	1	17	And 'loma (hair)' is two syllables, 'tvak  (skin)' two, 'asrik (blood)' two, 'medas (fat)' two, 'mâmsam (flesh)' two, 'snâva (sinew)' two, 'asthi (bone)' two, 'maggâ (marrow) ' two,--that makes sixteen digits; and the vital air which circulates therein, is the seventeenfold Pragâpati.
4	1	18	These sixteen digits convey the food to that vital air; and when they take to conveying no food to it, then it consumes them and departs (from the body): hence he who is hungry here, feels veryrestless, consumed as he is by his vital airs; and hence he who suffers from fever becomes very thin, for he is consumed by his vital airs.
4	1	19	Now for that seventeenfold Pragâpati they prepared this seventeenfold food, the Soma-sacrifice: those sixteen digits of his are these sixteen officiating priests,--one should not, therefore, take a seventeenth priest  lest one should do what is excessive;--and what vital sap there is here--the oblations that are offered--that is the seventeenfold food.
4	1	20	And when they chant the hymn, and when he (the Hotri) afterwards recites (the sastra), he (the Adhvaryu) offers to him that food as the Vashat-call is uttered. Now 'vauk' is this (Agni), and shat' this sixfold food: having prepared it, he offers it to him as proportionate to his body; for food which is proportionate to the body satisfies, and does not injure it; but when there is too much it does injure it, and when there is too little, it does not satisfy it.
4	1	21	Now that Arka (flame) is this very fire-altar built here; and the Kya is this his food, to wit, the Soma-sacrifice: that (combined) makes the Arkya in respect of the Yagus. And the Great one (mahân) is this (Agni), and this rite (vrata) is his food: that makes the Mahâvrata in respect of the Sâman. And 'uk' is this (Agni), and 'tha' his food: that makes the (Mahad) Uktha in respect of the Rik. Thus, whilst being only one, this is accounted threefold. With this food he went upwards; and he whowent upwards is yonder sun, and that food wherewith he went up is that moon.
4	1	22	He who shines yonder is indeed that Arka (flame), and that moon is his food, the Kya: that (combined) makes the Arkya in respect of the Yagus. And the Great one (mahân) is this (Agni), and this rite (vrata) is his food: that makes the Mahâvrata in respect of the Sâman. And 'uk' is this (Agni), and 'tha' his food: that makes the (Mahad) Uktha in respect of the Rik. Thus, whilst being only one, this is accounted threefold. Thus much as to the deity.
4	1	23	Now as to the body. The Arka (flame), doubtless, is the breath (vital air), and the Kya is its food: that makes the Arkya in respect of the Yagus. And the Great one (mahân) is this (Agni), and this rite (vrata) is his food: that makes the Mahâvrata in respect of the Sâman. And 'uk' is this (Agni), and 'tha' his food: that makes the (Mahad) Uktha in respect of the Rik. Thus, whilst being only one, this is accounted threefold. And, indeed, that (Agni) is that (sun) as to the deity, and this (breath) as to the body.
4	2	1	Verily, Pragâpati, the year, is Agni, and King Soma, the moon. He himself, indeed, proclaimed (taught) his own self to Yagñavakas Râgastambâyana, saying, 'As many lights as there are of mine, so many are my bricks.'
4	2	2	Now in this Pragâpati, the year, there are seven hundred and twenty days and nights, his lights, (being) those bricks; three hundred and sixtyenclosing-stones , and three hundred and sixty bricks with (special) formulas. This Pragâpati, the year, has created all existing things, both what breathes and the breathless, both gods and men. Having created all existing things, he felt like one emptied out, and was afraid of death.
4	2	3	He bethought himself, 'How can I get these beings back into my body? how can I put them back into my body? how can I be again the body of all these beings?'
4	2	4	He divided his body into two; there were three hundred and sixty bricks in the one, and as many in the other: he did trot succeed .
4	2	5	He made himself three bodies,--in each of them there were three eighties of bricks I he did not succeed.
4	2	6	He made himself four bodies of a hundred and eighty bricks each: he did not succeed.
4	2	7	He made himself five bodies,--in each of them there were a hundred and forty-four bricks: he did not succeed.
4	2	8	He made himself six bodies of a hundred and twenty bricks each: he did not succeed. He did not develop himself sevenfold .
4	2	9	He made himself eight bodies of ninety bricks each: he did not succeed.
4	2	10	He made himself nine bodies of eighty bricks each: he did not succeed.
4	2	11	He made himself ten bodies of seventy-two bricks each: he did not succeed. He did not develop elevenfold.
4	2	12	He made himself twelve bodies of sixty bricks each: he did not succeed. He did not develop either thirteenfold or fourteenfold.
4	2	13	He made himself fifteen bodies of forty-eight bricks each: he did not succeed.
4	2	14	He made himself sixteen bodies of forty-five bricks each: he did not succeed. He did not develop seventeenfold.
4	2	15	He made himself eighteen bodies of forty bricks each: he did not succeed. He did not develop nineteenfold.
4	2	16	He made himself twenty bodies of thirty-six bricks each: he did not succeed. He did not develop either twenty-one-fold, or twenty-two-fold, or twenty-three-fold.
4	2	17	He made himself twenty-four bodies of thirty bricks each. There he stopped, at the fifteenth; and because he stopped at the fifteenth arrangement  there are fifteen forms of the waxing, and fifteen of the waning (moon).
4	2	18	And because he made himself twenty-four bodies, therefore the year consists of twenty-four half-months. With these twenty-four bodies of thirty bricks each he had not developed (sufficiently). He saw the fifteen parts of the day, the muhûrtas ,as forms for his body, as space-fillers (Lokamprinâs ), as well as fifteen of the night; and inasmuch as they straightway (muhu) save (trai), they are (called) 'muhûrtâh'; and inasmuch as, whilst being small, they fill (pûr) these worlds (or spaces, 'loka') they are (called) 'lokamprinâh.'
4	2	19	That one (the sun) bakes everything here, by means of the days and nights, the half-moons, the months, the seasons, and the year; and this (Agni, the fire) bakes what is baked by that one: 'A baker of the baked (he is),' said Bhâradvâga of Agni; 'for he bakes what has been baked by that (sun).'
4	2	20	In the year these (muhûrtas) amounted to ten thousand and eight hundred: he stopped at the ten thousand and eight hundred.
4	2	21	He then looked round over all existing things, and beheld all existing things in the threefold lore (the Veda), for therein is the body of all metres, of all stomas, of all vital airs, and of all the gods: this, indeed, exists, for it is immortal, and what is immortal exists; and this (contains also) that which is mortal.
4	2	22	Pragâpati bethought himself, 'Truly, all existing things are in the threefold lore: well, then, I will construct for myself a body so as to contain the whole threefold lore.'
4	2	23	He arranged the Rik-verses into twelve thousand of Brihatîs , for of that extent are theverses created by Pragâpati. At-the thirtieth arrangement they came to an end in the Paṅktis; and because it was at the thirtieth arrangement that they came to an end, there are thirty nights in the month; and because it was in the Paṅktis, therefore Pragâpati is 'pâṅkta' (fivefold) . There are one hundred-and-eight hundred  Paṅktis.
4	2	24	He then arranged the two other Vedas into twelve thousand Brihatîs,--eight (thousand) of the Yagus (formulas), and four of the Sâman (hymns)--for of that extent is what was created by Pragâpati in these two Vedas. At the thirtieth arrangement these two came to an end in the Paṅktis; and because it was at the thirtieth arrangement that they came to an end, there are thirty nights in the month; and because it was in the Paṅktis, therefore Pragâpati is 'pâṅkta.' There were one hundred-and-eight hundred  Paṅktis.
4	2	25	All the three Vedas amounted to ten thousand eight hundred eighties (of syllables) ; muhûrta by muhûrta he gained a fourscore (of syllables), and muhûrta by muhûrta a fourscore was completed .
4	2	26	Into these three worlds, (in the form of) thefire-pan , he (Pragâpati) poured, as seed into the womb, his own self made up of the metres, stomas, vital airs, and deities. In the course of a half-moon the first body was made up, in a further (half-moon) the next (body), in a further one the next,--in a year he is made up whole and complete.
4	2	27	Whenever he laid down an enclosing-stone , he laid down a night, and along with that fifteen muhûrtas, and along with the muhûrtas fifteen eighties (of syllables of the sacred texts) . And whenever he laid down a brick with a formula (yagushmatî), he laid down a day , and along with that fifteen muhûrtas, and along with the muhûrtas fifteen eighties (of syllables). In this manner he put this threefold lore into his own self, and made it his own; and in this very (performance) he became the body of all existing things, (a body) composed of the metres, stomas, vital airs, and deities; and having become composed of all that, he ascended upwards; and he who thus ascended is that moon yonder.
4	2	28	He who shines yonder (the sun) is his foundation, (for) over him he was built up , on him he was built up: from out of his own self he thus fashioned him, from out of his own self he generated him.
4	2	29	Now when he (the Sacrificer), being about to build an altar, undergoes the initiation-rite,--even as Pragâpati poured his own self, as seed, into the fire-pan as the womb,--so does he pour into the fire-pan, as seed into the womb, his own self composed of the metres, stomas, vital airs, and deities. In the course of a half-moon, his first body is made up, in a further (half-moon) the next (body), in a further one the next,--in a year he is made up whole and complete.
4	2	30	And whenever he lays down an enclosing-stone, he lays down a night, and along with that fifteen muhûrtas, and along with the muhûrtas fifteen eighties (of syllables). And whenever he lays down a Yagushmatî (brick), he lays down a day, and along with that fifteen muhûrtas, and along with the muhûrtas fifteen eighties (of syllables of the sacred texts). In this manner he puts this threefold lore into his own self, and makes it his own; and in this very (performance) he becomes the body of all existing things, (a body) composed of the metres, stomas, vital airs, and deities; and having become composed of all that, he ascends upwards.
4	2	31	And he who shines yonder is his foundation, for over him he is built up, on him he is built up: from out of his own self he thus fashions him, from out of his own self he generates him. And whenhe who knows this departs from this world, then he passes into that body composed of the metres, stomas, vital airs, and deities; and verily having become composed of all that, he who, knowing this performs this sacrificial work, or he who even knows it, ascends upwards.
4	3	1	The Year, doubtless, is the same as Death; for he  it is who, by means of day and night, destroys the life of mortal beings, and then they die: therefore the Year is the same as Death; and whosoever knows this Year (to be) Death, his life that (year) does not destroy, by day and night, before old age, and he attains his full (extent of) life.
4	3	2	And he, indeed, is the Ender, for it is he who, by day and night, reaches the end of the life of mortals, and then they die: therefore he is the Ender, and whosoever knows this Year, Death, the Ender, the end of his life that (Year) does not reach, by day and night, before old age, and he attains his full (extent of) life.
4	3	3	The gods were afraid of this Pragâpati, the Year, Death, the Ender, lest he, by day and night, should reach the end of their life.
4	3	4	They performed these sacrificial rites--the Agnihotra, the New and Full-moon sacrifices, the Seasonal offerings, the animal sacrifice, and the Soma-sacrifice: by offering these sacrifices they did not attain immortality.
4	3	5	They also built a fire-altar,--they laid downunlimited enclosing-stones; unlimited Yagushmatî (bricks), unlimited Lokamprinâ (bricks), even as some lay them down to this day, saying, 'The gods did so.' They did not attain immortality.
4	3	6	They went on praising and toiling, striving to win immortality. Pragâpati then spake unto them, 'Ye do not lay down (put on me) all my forms; but ye either make (me) too large or leave (me) defective: therefore ye do not become immortal.'
4	3	7	They spake, 'Tell thou us thyself, then, in what manner we may lay down all thy forms!'
4	3	8	He spake, 'Lay ye down three hundred and sixty enclosing-stones, three hundred and sixty Yagushmatî (bricks), and thirty-six thereunto; and of Lokamprinâ (bricks) lay ye down ten thousand and eight hundred; and ye will be laying down all my forms, and will become immortal.' And the gods laid down accordingly, and thereafter became immortal.
4	3	9	Death spake unto the gods, 'Surely, on this wise all men will become immortal, and what share will then be mine?' They spake, 'Henceforward no one shall be immortal with the body: only when thou shalt have taken that (body) as thy share, he who is to become immortal either through knowledge, or through holy work, shall become immortal after separating from the body.' Now when they said, 'either through knowledge or through holy work,' it is this fire-altar that is the knowledge, and this fire-altar that is the holy work.
4	3	10	And they who so know this, or they who do this holy work, come to life again when they have died, and, coming to life, they come to immortal life. But they who do not know this, or do not do thisholy work, come to life again when they die, and they become the food of him (Death) time after time.
4	3	11	But when he builds the fire-altar, he thereby gains Agni, Pragâpati, the Year, Death, the Ender, whom the gods gained; it is him he lays downy even as the gods thus laid him down.
4	3	12	By the enclosing-stones he gains his nights; by the Yagushmatî (bricks) his days, half-moons, months, and seasons; and by the Lokamprinâs the muhûrtas (hours).
4	3	13	Thus the enclosing-stones, supplying the place of nights, are made the (means of) gaining the nights, they are the counterpart of the nights: there are three hundred and sixty of them, for there are three hundred and sixty nights in the year. Of these, he lays twenty-one round the Gârhapatya, seventy-eight round the Dhishnya hearths, and two hundred and sixty-one round the Âhavanîya.
4	3	14	Then the Yagushmatî (bricks with special formulas):--the grass-bunch, the (four) clod-bricks, the lotus-leaf, the gold plate and man, the two spoons, the naturally-perforated (brick), the dûrvâ-brick, the (one) dviyagus, two retahsik, a visvagyotis, two seasonal ones, an ashâdhâ, the tortoise, the mortar and pestle, the fire-pan, the five victims’ heads, fifteen apasyâs, five khandasyâs, fifty prânabhrits--these ninety-eight are (in) the first layer.
4	3	15	Then the second (layer):--five asvinîs, two seasonal ones, five vaisvadevîs, five prânabhrits, five apasyâs, nineteen vayasyâs--these forty-one are (in) the second layer.
4	3	16	Then the third (layer):--the naturally-perforated one, five regional ones, a visvagyotis, four seasonal ones, ten prânabhrits, thirty-six khandasyâs,fourteen vâlakhilyas--these seventy-one are (in) the third layer.
4	3	17	Then the fourth (layer):--first eighteen, then twelve, then seventeen--these forty-seven are (in) the fourth layer.
4	3	18	Then the fifth (layer):--five asapatnâs, forty virâgs, twenty-nine stomabhâgâs, five nâkasads, five pañkakûdâs, thirty-one khandasyâs, eight (of) the Gârhapatya hearth, eight (of) the Punaskiti, two seasonal ones, a visvagyotis, a vikarnî, a naturally-perforated one, the variegated stone, the fire which is placed on the altar--these one hundred and thirty-eight are (in) the fifth layer.
4	3	19	All these make three hundred and ninety-five. Of these, three hundred and sixty, supplying the place of days, are made the (means of) gaining the days, they are the counterpart of the days: There are three hundred and sixty of them, for there are three hundred and sixty days in the year. And for the thirty-six (additional days) which there are  the filling of earth (counts as) the thirty-sixth; and twenty-four thereof, supplying the place of half-moons, are made the (means of) gaining the half-moons, they are the counterpart of the half-moons. And the (remaining) twelve, supplying the place of months, are made the (means of) gaining the months, they are the counterpart of the months. And, lest the seasons should be wanting, these (twelve bricks), by two and two (taken) together, supply the place of seasons.
4	3	20	And as to the Lokamprinâ (space-filling bricks), supplying the place of muhûrtas (hours), they are made the (means) of gaining the muhûrtas, they are the counterpart of the muhûrtas: there are ten thousand and eight hundred of them, for so many muhûrtas there are in the year. Of these, he lays down twenty-one in the Gârhapatya (altar), seventy-eight in the Dhishnya-hearths, and the others in the Âhavanîya. So many, indeed, are the (different) forms of the year: it is these that are here secured for him (Pragâpati, the Year), and are put on him.
4	3	21	Now, some wish to get this total amount  in the Âhavanîya itself, arguing, 'Those are different brick-built fire-altars: why should we here (in the Âhavanîya altar) take into account those laid down there (in the Gârhapatya and Dhishnyas)?' But let him not do so. There are, indeed, ten of these fire-altars he builds--eight Dhishnyas, the Âhavanîya and the Gârhapatya--whence they say, 'Agni is Virâg (wide shining or ruling),' for the Virâg (metre) consists of ten syllables: but, surely, all these (altars and hearths) are looked upon as only one, as Agni; for it is merely forms of him that they all are,--even as the days and nights, the half-moons, the months, and the seasons (are forms) of the year, so are they all forms of him (Agni).
4	3	22	And, assuredly, they who do this put those forms of his  outside of him, and produce confusion between the better and the worse; they make the peasantry equal and refractory to the nobility. Surely, on the Âgnîdhrîya he places the variegatedstone , and that he takes into account: why, then, taking that into account, should he not take others into account? That (altar) by which they ward off Nirriti , evil, is the eleventh.
4	3	23	As to this they say, 'Why, then, do they not take into account here those (of Nirriti's altar)?' Because he makes no offering on them, for it is by offering that a brick becomes whole and complete.
4	3	24	As to this they say, 'How are these (bricks) of his laid down so as not to be excessive?' Well, these (bricks) are his (Agni's) vital power, and man's vital power is not excessive. Thus whosoever, knowing this, performs this holy work, or he who but knows this, makes up this Pragâpati whole and complete.
4	4	1	When Pragâpati was creating living beings, Death, that evil, overpowered him. He practised austerities for a thousand years, striving to leave evil behind him.
4	4	2	Whilst he was practising austerities, lights went upwards from those hair-pits  of his; and those lights are those stars: as many stars as there are, so many hair-pits there are; and as many hair-pits as there are, so many muhûrtas there are in a (sacrificial performance) of a thousand years.
4	4	3	In the one-thousandth year, he cleansed himself all through; and he that cleansed all through is this wind which here cleanses by blowing; and that evil which he cleansed all through is this body. But what is man that he could secure for himself a (life) of a thousand years ? By knowledge, assuredly, he who knows secures for himself (the benefits of a performance) of a thousand years.
4	4	4	Let him look upon all these bricks as a thousandfold: let him look upon each enclosing-stone as charged with a thousand nights, each day-holder  with a thousand days, each half-moon-holder with a thousand half-moons, each month-holder with a thousand months, each season-holder with a thousand seasons, each muhûrta-holder  with a thousand muhûrtas, and the year with a thousand years. They who thus know this Agni as being endowed with a thousand, know his one-thousandth digit; but they who do not thus know him, do not even know a one-thousandth digit of him. And he alone who so knows this, or who performs this sacred work, obtains this whole and complete Pragâpatean Agni whom Pragâpati obtained. Wherefore let him who knows this by all means practise austerities ; for, indeed, when he who knows this practises austerities, even to (abstention from) sexual intercourse, every (part) of him will share in the world of heaven .
4	4	5	It is regarding this that it is said in the Rik , 'Not in vain is the labour which the gods favour;' for, in truth, for him who knows there is no labouring in vain, and so, indeed, the gods favour this every (action) of his .
4	5	1	Now the doctrines of mystic imports . The Sâkâyanins hold that 'Agni is Vâyu (the wind);' but some say that 'Agni is Âditya (the sun).' And either Sraumatya, or Hâliṅgava, said, 'Agni is no other than Vâyu: wherefore the Adhvaryu, when he performs the last work , passes into that (wind).'
4	5	2	And Sâtyâyani said, 'Agni is no other than the Year; his head is the spring, his right wing the summer, his left wing the rainy season, his middle body (trunk) the autumn season, and his tail and feet the winter and dewy seasons--Agni is speech, Vâyu breath, the sun the eye, the moon the mind, the quarters the ear, the generative power water , the feet (and tail) fervour, the joints the months, the veins the half-moons, the silver and gold feathersthe days and nights: thus he passes over to the gods.' Let him know, then, that Agni is the Year; and let him know that it is thereof  he consists.
4	5	3	And Kelaka Sândilyâyana said, 'Let him know that the three layers containing the naturally-perforated (bricks)  are these worlds, that the fourth (layer) is the Sacrificer, and the fifth all objects of desire; and that it is these worlds, and his own self and all his objects of desire he compasses.'
5	1	1	The mystic import of this Fire-altar, doubtless, is Speech; for it is with speech that it is built: with the Rik, the Yagus and the Sâman as the divine (speech); and when he (the Adhvaryu) speaks with human speech, 'Do ye this! do ye that!' then also it (the altar) is built therewith.
5	1	2	Now, this speech is threefold--the Rik-verses, the Yagus-formulas, and the Sâman-tunes;--thereby the Fire-altar is threefold, inasmuch as it is built with that triad. Even thus, then, it is threefold; but in this respect also it is threefold, inasmuch as three kinds of bricks are put into it--those with masculine names, those with feminine names, and those with neuter names; and these limbs of men also are of three kinds--those with masculine names, those with feminine names, and those with neuter names.
5	1	3	This body (of the altar), indeed, is threefold; and with this threefold body he obtains the threefold divine Amrita (nectar, immortality). Now all these (bricks) are called 'ishtakâ (f.),' not 'ishtakah (m.),' nor 'ishtakam (n.):' thus (they are called) after the form of speech (vâk, f.), for everything here is speech--whether feminine (female), masculine (male), or neuter--for by speech everything here is obtained. Therefore he 'settles' all (the bricks)  with, 'Aṅgiras-like lie thou steady (dhruvâ, f.)!' not with, 'Aṅgiras-like lie thou steady (dhruvah, m.)!' or with, 'Aṅgiras-like lie thou steady (dhruvam, n.)!' for it is that Speech he is constructing.
5	1	4	Now, this speech is yonder sun, and this (Agni, the Fire-altar) is Death: hence whatsoever is on this side of the sun all that is field by Death; and he who builds it (the Fire-altar) on this side thereof, builds it as one held by Death, and he surrenders his own self unto Death; but he who builds it thereabove, conquers recurring Death, for by his knowledge that (altar) of his is built thereabove.
5	1	5	This speech, indeed, is threefold--the Rik-verses, the Yagus-formulas, and the Sâman-tunes the Rik-verses are the orb, the Sâman-tunes the light, and the Yagus-formulas the man (in the sun); and that immortal element, the shining light, is this lotus-leaf : thus, when he builds up the Fire-altarafter laying down the lotus-leaf, it is on that immortal element that he builds for himself a body consisting of the Rik, the Yagus, and the Sâman; and he becomes immortal.
5	2	1	Now, that shining orb is the Great Litany, the Rik-verses: this is the world of the Rik. And that glowing light is (the hymn of) the Great Rite, the Sâman-tunes: this is the world of the Sâman. And the man in yonder orb is the Fire-altar, the Yagus-formulas: this is the world of the Yagus.
5	2	2	It is this threefold lore that shines, and even they who do not know this say, 'This threefold lore does indeed shine;' for it is Speech that, seeing it, speaks thus.
5	2	3	And that man in yonder (sun's) orb is no other than Death; and that glowing light is that immortal element: therefore Death does not die, for he is within the immortal; and therefore he is not seen, for he is within the immortal .
5	2	4	There is this verse:--'Within Death is immortality,'--for below death is immortality;--'founded on Death is immortality,'--for established on that man (in the sun) the immortal shines ;--'Death putteth on the radiant,'--theradiant one (vivasvant), doubtless, is yonder sun, for he irradiates (vi-vas) day and night; and it is him that (Death) puts on, for on every side he is surrounded by him;--'Death's self is in the radiant,'--for the self (body) of that man indeed is in that orb: such, then, is that verse.
5	2	5	Now, that orb is the foundation (foothold) of both that light and that man; whence one must not recite the Great Litany for another , lest he should cut away that foothold from beneath his own self; for he who recites the Mahad Uktham for another, indeed cuts away that foothold from beneath his own self: wherefore the (professional) singer of praises (sastra) is greatly despised, for he is cut off from his foothold. Thus in regard to the deity.
5	2	6	Now as to the sacrifice. That shining orb is the same as this gold plate (under the altar) , and that glowing light is the same as this lotus-leaf (under the altar); for there are those (divine)waters , and the lotus-leaf is water ; and that man in yonder orb is no other than this gold man (in the altar): thus, by laying down these (in the fire-altar), it is that (divine) triad he constructs. And after the consummation of the sacrifice it rises upwards and enters that shining (sun): one need not therefore mind destroying Agni, for he is then in yonder (world) . Thus, then, in regard to the sacrifice.
5	2	7	Now as to the self (body). That shining orb and that gold plate are the same as the white here in the eye; and that glowing light and that lotus-leaf are the same as the black here in the eye; and that man in yonder orb and that gold man are the same as this man in the right eye.
5	2	8	The Lokamprinâ (space-filling brick) is the same as that (gold man in the sun) : it is that (brick) which this entire Agni finally results in . Moreover, this man (or person) in the left eye is the mate of that one (in the right eye and in the sun); and a mate is one half of one's own self , for when one is with a mate he is whole and complete: thus it (the second man) is for the sake of completeness. And as to there being two of these (persons in the eyes), a pair means a productive couple: hence two Lokamprinâs are laid down each time , and hence they set up the layer by two (kinds of bricks).
5	2	9	Now, that person in the right eye is the same as Indra, and (that other person is) the same as Indrânî: it is for the sake of these two that the gods made that partition (between the eyes), the nose; whence he (the husband) should not eat food in the presence of his wife ; for from him (whodoes not do so) a vigorous son is born, and she in whose presence (the husband) does not eat food bears a vigorous (son):--
5	2	10	Such, indeed, is the divine ordinance;--amongst men princes keep most aloof , and for that reason a vigorous (son) is born to them; and of birds the Amritavâkâ (does so, and she) produces the Kshiprasyena .
5	2	11	Those two (persons in the eyes) descend to the cavity of the heart , and enter into union with each other; and when they reach the end of their union, then the man sleeps,--even as here on reaching the end of a human union he becomes, as it were, insensible , so does he then become, as it were,insensible; for this is a divine union , and that is the highest bliss.
5	2	12	Therefore let him, who knows this, sleep, for it makes for heaven : he thereby, indeed, makes those two deities enjoy their dear wish, union. And one should not therefore forcibly  awaken him who sleeps, lest he should hurt those two deities whilst enjoying their union; and hence the mouth of him who has been asleep is, as it were, clammy, for those two deities are then shedding seed, and from that seed everything here originates, whatsoever exists.
5	2	13	Now, that man in yonder orb (of the sun), and that man in the right eye truly are no other than Death;--his feet have stuck fast in the heart, and having pulled them out he comes forth; and when he comes forth then that man dies: whence they say of him who has passed away, 'he has been cut off .'
5	2	14	And, indeed, he is the breath (prâna), for it is he (the man in the eye) that leads forward (pranayati) all these creatures. These vital airs (prâna) are his own (sva); and when he sleeps (svapiti) thenthese vital airs take possession of him  as his own (svâ api-yanti): hence (the term) 'svâpyaya (being taken possession of by one's own people),' 'svâpyaya' doubtless being what they mystically call 'svapna (sleep),' for the gods love the mystic.
5	2	15	And when he is asleep, he does not, by means of them, know of anything whatever, nor does he form any resolution with his mind, or distinguish the taste of food with (the channel of) his speech, or distinguish any smell with (the channel of) his breath; neither does he see with his eye, nor hear with his ear, for those (vital airs) have taken possession of him. Whilst being one only, he (the man in the eye) is numerously distributed among living beings: whence the Lokamprinâ (representing the man in the sun), whilst being one only (in kind), extends over the whole altar; and because he (the man in the eye) is one only, therefore (the Lokamprinâ) is one.
5	2	16	As to this they say, 'One death, or many?' Let him say, 'Both one and many;' for inasmuch as he is that (man in the sun) in yonder world he is one, and inasmuch as he is numerously distributed here on earth among living beings, there are also many of them.
5	2	17	As to this they say, 'Is Death near or far away?' Let him say, 'Both near and far away;' for inasmuch as he is here on earth in the body he is near, and inasmuch as he is that one in yonder world he also is far away.
5	2	18	Regarding this there is the verse,--'Concealedin food he, the immortal, shineth at the flowing together of vital saps;'--yonder shining orb is food, and the man in that orb is the eater: being concealed in that food, he shines. Thus much as to the deity.
5	2	19	Now as to the body. This body indeed is food, and that man in the right eye is the eater: being concealed in that food he shines.
5	2	20	That same (divine person), the Adhvaryus (Yagur-veda priests) serve under the name of 'Agni' (fire-altar) and 'Yagus,' because he holds together (yug) all this (universe) ; the Khandogas (Sâma-veda priests, chanters) under that of 'Sâman,' because in him all this (universe) is one and the same (samâna) ; the Bahvrikas (Rig-veda priests, Hotars) under that of 'Uktham,' because he originates (utthâp) everything here; those skilled in sorcery, under that of 'sorcery (yâtu),' because everything here is held in check (yata) by him; the serpents under that of 'poison;' the snake-charmers under that of 'snake;' the gods under that of 'ûrg (strengthening food);' men under that of 'wealth;' demons under that of 'mâyâ (magic power);' the deceased Fathers under that of 'svadhâ (invigorating draught);' those knowing the divine host under that of 'divine host;' the Gandharvas under that of 'form (rûpa );' the Apsaras under that of 'fragrance (gandha),'--thus, in whatsoever form they serve him that indeed he becomes, and, having become that,he is helpful to them; whence he who knows should serve him in all these (forms), for he becomes all that, and, having become all that, he is helpful to him.
5	2	21	Now this Agni (fire-altar) consists of three bricks,--the Rik being one, the Yagus another, and the Sâman another: whatever (brick) he lays down here with a rik (verse) that has the gold plate for its foundation ; whatever (brick he lays down) with a yagus (formula) that has the (gold) man for its foundation; and whatever (brick he lays down) with a sâman (hymn-tune) that has the lotus-leaf for its foundation. Thus he consists of three bricks.
5	2	22	And, indeed, these two, to wit, that gold plate and that lotus-leaf join that (gold) man, for both the Rik and the Sâman join the Yagus; and so he also consists of a single brick.
5	2	23	Now, that man in yonder orb (of the sun), and this man in the right eye, are no other than Death ; and he becomes the body (self) of him who knows this: whenever he who knows departs this world he passes into that body, and becomes immortal, for Death is his own self.
5	3	1	Verily, in the beginning this (universe) was, as it were , neither non-existent nor existent; inthe beginning this (universe), indeed, as it were, existed and did not exist: there was then only that Mind.
5	3	2	Wherefore it has been said by the Rishi , 'There was then neither the non-existent nor the existent;' for Mind was, as it were, neither existent nor non-existent.
5	3	3	This Mind, when created, wished to become manifest,--more defined , more substantial: it sought after a self (body) . It practised austerity : it acquired consistency . It then beheld thirty-six thousand Arka-fires  of its own self, composed of mind, built up of mind: mentally  alone they were established (on sacrificial hearths) and mentallybuilt up ; mentally the cups (of Soma) were drawn thereat mentally they chanted, and mentally they recited on (near) them,--whatever rite is performed at the sacrifice, whatever sacrificial rite there is, that was performed mentally only, as a mental performance, on those (fires or fire-altars) composed of mind, and built up of mind. And whatever it is that (living) beings here conceive in their mind that was done regarding those (mental Agnis ):--they establish them (on the hearths) and build them up (as fire-altars); they draw the cups for them; they chant on (near) them and recite hymns on them,--of that extent was the development of Mind, of that extent its creation,--so great is Mind: thirty-six thousand Arka-fires; and each of these as great as that former (fire-altar) was.
5	3	4	That Mind created Speech. This Speech, when created, wished to become manifest,--more defined, more substantial: it sought after a self. It practised austerity: it acquired consistency. It beheld thirty-six thousand Arka-fires of its own self, composed of speech, built up of speech: with speech they were established, and with speech built up; with speech the cups were drawn thereat; with speech they chanted, and with speech they recited on them--whatever rite is performed at the sacrifice, whatever sacrificial rite there is, that wasperformed by speech alone, as a vocal performance, on those (fires) composed of speech, and built up of speech. And whatever beings here speak by speech that was done regarding those (fires): they establish them and build them up; they draw the cups for them; they chant on them and recite hymns on them,--of that extent was the development of Speech, of that extent its creation,--so great is Speech: thirty-six thousand Arka-fires; and each of these as great as that former (fire-altar) was.
5	3	5	That Speech created the Breath. This Breath, when created, wished to become manifest,--more defined, more substantial: it sought after a self It practised austerity: it acquired consistency. It beheld thirty-six thousand Arka-fires of its own self, composed of breath, built up of breath: with breath they were established, and with breath built up; with breath the cups were drawn thereat; with breath they chanted and with breath they recited on them,--whatever rite is performed at the sacrifice, whatever sacrificial rite there is, that was performed by breath alone, as a breathing-performance, on those (fires) composed of breath, and built up of breath. And whatever beings here breathe with breath that was done regarding those (fires):--they establish them, and build them up; they draw the cups for them; they chant on them and recite hymns on them,--of that extent was the development of Breath, of that extent was its creation,--so great is Breath: thirty-six thousand Arka-fires; and each of these as great as that former (fire-altar) was.
5	3	6	That Breath created the Eye. This Eye, when created, wished to become manifest,--moredefined, more substantial: it sought after a self. It practised austerity: it acquired consistency. It beheld thirty-six thousand Arka-fires of its own self, composed of the eye, built up of the eye: by means of the eye they were established, and by means of the eye built up; by the eye the cups were drawn thereat; by means of the eye they chanted and recited hymns on them,--whatever rite is performed as the sacrifice, whatever sacrificial rite there is, that was performed by the eye alone, as an eye-performance, on those (fires) composed of eye, and built up of the eye. And whatever beings here see with the eye that was done regarding those (fires):they establish them and build them up; they draw the cups for them; they chant on them and recite hymns on them,--of that extent was the development of the Eye, of that extent its creation,--so great is the Eye: thirty-six thousand Arka-fires; and each of these as great as that former (fire-altar) was.
5	3	7	That Eye created the Ear. This Ear, when created, wished to become manifest,--more defined, more substantial: it sought after a self. It practised austerity: it acquired consistency. It beheld thirty-six thousand Arka-fires of its own self, composed of the ear, built up of the ear: by means of the ear they were established, and by means of the ear built up; by the ear the cups were drawn thereat; by means of the ear they chanted and recited hymns on them,--whatever rite is performed at the sacrifice, whatever sacrificial rite there is, that was performed by the ear alone, as an ear-performance, on those (fires) composed of ear, and built up of the ear. And whatever beings here hear with the earthat was done regarding those (fires):--they establish them and build, them up; they draw the cups for them; they chant on them and recite hymns on them,--of that extent was the development of the Ear, of that extent its creation,--so great is the Ear: thirty-six thousand Arka-fires; and each of these as great as that former (fire-altar) was.
5	3	8	That Ear created Work, and this condensed itself into the vital airs, into this compound, this composition of food ; for incomplete is work without the vital airs, and incomplete are the vital airs without work.
5	3	9	This Work, when created, wished to become manifest,--more defined, more substantial: it sought after a self. It practised austerity: it acquired consistency. It beheld thirty-six thousand Arka-fires of its own self, composed of work, built up of (or by) work: by work they were established, and by work built up; by work the cups were drawn thereat; by work they chanted and recited hymns on them,--whatever rite is performed at the sacrifice, whatever sacrificial rite there is, that was performed by work alone, as a work-performance, on those (fires) composed of work, and built up of work. And whatever beings here work by work that was done regarding those (fires);--they establish them and build them up; they draw the cups for them; they chant on them and recite hymns on them,--of that extent was the development of Work, of thatextent its creation,--so great is Work: thirty-six thousand Arka-fires; and each of these as great as that former (fire-altar) was.
5	3	10	That Work created the Fire,--Fire, doubtless, is more manifest than Work, for by work (sacrificial performance) they produce it, and by work they kindle it.
5	3	11	This Fire, when created, wished to become manifest,--more defined, more substantial: it sought after a self. It practised austerity : it acquired consistency. It beheld thirty-six thousand Arka-fires of its own self, composed of fire, built up of fire: with fire they were established, and with fire built up; with fire the cups were drawn thereat; with fire they chanted and recited hymns on them;--whatever rite is performed at the sacrifice, whatever sacrificial rite there is, that was performed with fire alone, as a fire-performance, on those (fires) composed of fire, and built up of fire. And whatever fire beings here kindle that was done regarding those (fires):--they establish them and build them up; they draw the cups for them; they chant on them and recite hymns on them,--of that extent was the development of Fire, of that extent its creation,--so great is Fire: thirty-six thousand Arka-fires; and each of these as great as that former (fire-altar) was.
5	3	12	These fires (altars), in truth, are knowledge-built; and all beings at all times build them for him who knows this, even whilst he is asleep: by knowledge alone these fires (altars) are indeed built for him who knows this.
5	4	1	Verily, this (brick-)built Fire-altar (Agni) is this (terrestrial) world:--the waters (of the encircling ocean) are its (circle of) enclosing-stones; the men its Yagushmatîs (bricks with special formulas); the cattle its Sûdadohas ; the plants and trees its earth-fillings (between the layers of bricks), its oblations and fire-logs ; Agni (the terrestrial fire) its Lokamprinâ (space-filling brick);--thus this comes to make up the whole Agni, and the whole Agni comes to be the space-filler ; and, verily, whosoever knows this, thus comes to be that whole (Agni) who is the space-filler .
5	4	2	But, indeed, that Fire-altar also is the air:--the function of heaven and earth (the horizon) is its (circle of) enclosing-stones, for it is beyond the air that heaven and earth meet, and that (junction) is the (circle of) enclosing-stones; the birds are its Yagushmatî bricks, the rain its Sûdadohas, the raysof light its earth-fillings, oblations and fire-logs; Vâyu (the wind) is its space-filler; thus this comes to make up the whole Agni, and the whole Agni comes to be the space-filler; and, verily, whosoever knows this, thus comes to be that whole (Agni) who is the space-filler.
5	4	3	But, indeed, that Fire-altar also is the sky:--the (heavenly) waters are its enclosing-stones, for even as a case  here is closed up so are these worlds (enclosed) within the waters; and the waters beyond these worlds are the enclosing-stones;--the gods are the Yagushmatî bricks; what food there is in that world is its Sûdadohas; the Nakshatras (lunar mansions) are the earth-fillings, the oblations and the fire-logs; and Âditya (the sun) is the space-filler;--thus this comes to make up the whole Agni; and the whole Agni comes to be the space-filler; and, verily, whosoever knows this, thus comes to be that whole (Agni) who is the space-filler.
5	4	4	But, indeed, that Fire-altar also is the sun:--the regions are its enclosing-stones, and there are three hundred and sixty of these , because three hundred and sixty regions encircle the sun on all sides;--the rays are its Yagushmatî bricks, for there are three hundred and sixty of these , and three hundred and sixty rays of the sun; and in that he establishes the Yagushmatîs within the enclosing-stones thereby he establishes the rays in the regions. And what is between the regions and the rays, is its Sûdadohas; and what food there is in the regions and rays that is the earth-fillings, the oblations andthe fire-logs; and that which is called both 'regions' and 'rays' is the space-filling (brick):--thus this comes to make up the whole Agni; and the whole Agni comes to be the space-filler; and, verily, whosoever knows this, thus comes to be that whole (Agni) who is the space-filler.
5	4	5	But, indeed, that Fire-altar also is the Nakshatras:--for there are twenty-seven of these Nakshatras, and twenty-seven secondary stars accompany each Nakshatra,--this makes seven hundred and twenty , and thirty-six in addition thereto. Now what seven hundred and twenty bricks  there are of these, they are the three hundred and sixty enclosing-stones and the three hundred and sixty Yagushmatî bricks; and what thirty-six there are in addition, they are the thirteenth (intercalary) month, the body (of the altar); the trunk  (consisting of) thirty, the feet of two, the (channels of the) vital airs of two , and the head itself being the (thirty-fifth and) thirty-sixth,--and as to there being two of these, it is because 'siras' (head) consists of two syllables;--and what (space) there is between (each) two Nakshatras that is the Sûdadohas; and what food there is in the Nakshatras that is the earth-fillings (between the layers of bricks), the oblations and the fire-logs; and what is called 'nakshatras' that is the space-filling (brick):--thus this comes to make up the whole Agni, and the whole Agni comes to be the space-filler; and, verily, whosoever knows this, thus comes to be that whole (Agni) who is the space-filler.
5	4	6	Now, these (amount to) twenty-one Brihatîs ; and--the heavenly world being the twenty-one-fold one  and the Brihatî (the great one)--this (altar) thus comes to be equal to the heavenly world, and to the twenty-one-fold Stoma (hymn-form) and the Brihatî metre.
5	4	7	But, indeed, that Fire-altar also is the Metres; for there are seven of these metres, increasing by four syllables ; and the triplets of these make seven hundred and twenty syllables, and thirty-six in addition thereto. Now what seven hundred and twenty bricks there are of these, they are the three hundred and sixty enclosing-stones and the three hundred and sixty Yagushmatîs; and what thirty-six there are in addition, they are the thirteenth month, and the body (of this altar),--the trunk (consisting of) thirty, the feet of two,the vital airs of two, and the head itself being the (thirty-fifth and) thirty-sixth; and as to there being two of these, it is because 'siras' consists of two syllables.
5	4	8	Now the first ten syllables of this Brihatî, consisting of thirty-six syllables, make an Ekapadâ  of ten syllables; and the (first) twenty make a Dvipadâ of twenty syllables; and the (first) thirty a Virâg  of thirty syllables; and the (first) thirty-three a (Virâg) of thirty-three syllables; and the (first) thirty-four a Svarâg  of thirty-four syllables; and in that this fire-altar is built with all metres thereby it is an Atikhandas , and (so) indeed are all these bricks . And the three syllables 'ishtakâ (brick)' are a Gâyatrî tripadâ, whence this Agni is Gâyatra; and the three syllables 'mrid' (clay) and 'âpah' (water)  also are a Gâyatrî tripadâ: thereby also he is Gâyatra. And what is between (each two) metres is the Sûdadohas; and the food which is in the metres is the earth-fillings, the oblations, and the fire-logs; and what is called 'metres,' that is the space-filling (brick):--thus this comes to make up the whole Agni; and the whole Agni comes to be the space-filler; and, verily, whosoever knows this, comes to be that whole (Agni) who is the space-filler.
5	4	9	Now, these (amount to) twenty-one Brihatîs; and--the heavenly world being the twenty-one-fold and the Brihatî--this (altar) thus comes to be equal to the heavenly world, and to the twenty-one-fold Stoma and the Brihatî metre.
5	4	10	But, indeed, that Fire-altar also is the Year,--the nights are its enclosing-stones, and there are three hundred and sixty of these, because there are three hundred and sixty nights in the year; and the days are its Yagushmatî bricks, for there are three hundred and sixty of these, and three hundred and sixty days in the year; and those thirty-six bricks which are over  are the thirteenth month, the body (of the year and the altar), the half-months and months,--(there being) twenty-four half-months, and twelve months. And what there is between day and night that is the Sûdadohas; and what food there is in the days and nights is the earth-fillings, the oblations, and the fire-logs; and what is called 'days and nights' that constitutes the space-filling (brick):--thus this comes to make up the whole Agni, and the whole Agni comes to be the space-filler; and, verily, whosoever knows this, thus comes to be that whole (Agni) who is the space-filler.
5	4	11	Now, these (amount to) twenty-one Brihatîs; and--the heavenly world being the twenty-one-fold and the Brihatî--this (altar) thus comes to be equal to the heavenly world, and to the twenty-one-fold Stoma and the Brihatî metre.
5	4	12	But, indeed, that Fire-altar also-is the body,--the bones are its enclosing-stones, and there are three hundred and sixty of these, because there are three hundred and sixty bones in man; the marrow parts are the Yagushmatî bricks, for there are three hundred and sixty of these, and three hundred and sixty parts of marrow in man; and those thirty-six bricks which are over, are the thirteenth month, the trunk, the vital air (of the altar),--in his body there are thirty parts , in his feet two, in his vital airs two, and in his head two,--as to there being two of these, it is because the head consists of two skull-bones. And that whereby these joints are held together is the Sûdadohas; and those three whereby this body is covered--to wit, hair, skin, and flesh--are the earth-fillings; what he drinks is the oblations, and what he eats the fire-logs; and what is called the 'body,' that is the space-filling (brick):--thus this comes to make up the whole Agni, and the whole Agni comes to be the space-filler; and, verily, whosoever knows this, thus comes to be that whole (Agni) who is the space-filler.
5	4	13	Now, these (amount to) twenty-one Brihatîs; and--the heavenly world being the twenty-one-fold and the Brihatî--this (altar) thus comes to be equal to the heavenly world, and to the twenty-one-fold Stoma and the Brihatî metre.
5	4	14	But, indeed, that built Agni (the fire-altar) is all beings, all the gods; for all the gods, all beings are the waters , and that built fire-altar is the same as those waters ;--the navigable streams (round the sun) are its enclosing-stones, and there are three hundred and sixty of these, because three hundred and sixty navigable streams encircle the sun on all sides; and the navigable streams, indeed, are also the Yagushmatî bricks, and there are three hundred and sixty of these, because three hundred and sixty navigable streams flow towards  the sun. And what is between (each) two navigable rivers is the Sûdadohas; and those thirty-six bricks which remain over are the same as that thirteenth month, and the body (of this altar, the waters ,) is the same as this gold man.
5	4	15	His feet are that gold plate and lotus-leaf(that is) the waters and the sun's orb --are his feet; his arms are the two spoons, and they are Indra and Agni; the two naturally-perforated (bricks) are this earth and the air; and the three Visvagyotis (all-light) bricks are these deities--Agni, Vâyu, and Âditya, for these deities, indeed, are all the light; and the twelve seasonal (bricks) are the year, the body (of the altar, and the gold man); and the five Nâkasads and five Pañkakûdâs are the sacrifice, the gods; and the Vikarnî the (third) Svayamâtrinnâ and the variegated stone ; and the fire which is deposited (on the altar ) is the thirty-fifth; and the formula of the Lokamprinâ (brick)  is the thirty-sixth;--that (gold man), indeed, the body (of the altar) is the end of everything here : he is in the midst of all the waters, endowed with all objects of desire--for all objects of desire are the waters ; whilst possessed of all (objects of) desires he is without desire, for no desire of anything (troubles) him .
5	4	16	Regarding this there is this verse--'By knowledge  they ascend that (state) where desires have vanished : sacrificial gifts go not thither , nor the fervid practisers of rites without knowledge;'--for, indeed, he who does not know this does not attain to that world either by sacrificial gifts or by devoutpractices, but only to those who know does that world belong.
5	4	17	The welkin is the earth-fillings (between the layers of brick); the moon the oblations; the Nakshatras (lunar mansions) the fire-logs,--because the moon resides in (or with) the Nakshatra, therefore the oblation resides in the fire-wood: that , indeed, is the food of the oblation, and its support; whence the oblation does not fail (na kshîyate), for that is its food and its support And what are called 'the gods' they are the space-filling (brick); for by (naming) the gods everything here is named.
5	4	18	It is regarding this that it is said by the Rik , 'The All-gods have gone after this thy Yagus,'--for all beings, all the gods, indeed, become the Yagus here. Thus this whole Agni comes to be the space-filler; and, verily, whosoever knows this, thus comes to be that whole (Agni) who is the space-filler.
5	4	19	Now, these (amount to) twenty-one Brihatîs; and--the heavenly world being the twenty-one-fold and the Brihatî--this (altar) thus comes to be equal to the heavenly world, and to the twenty-one-fold Stoma and the Brihatî metre.
5	5	1	Kusri Vâgasravasa  once built a fire-altar. Susravas Kaushya then said to him, 'Gautama, when thou wert just now building up Agni, didst thou build him with his face forward, or backward, or downward, or upward?
5	5	2	'If perchance thou hast built him looking forward, it would be just as if one were to offer food from behind to one sitting with averted face : he thereby will not receive thy offering.
5	5	3	'And if thou hast built him looking backward, wherefore, then, hast thou made him a tail behind?
5	5	4	'And if thou hast built him with his face downward, it would be just as if one were to put food on the back of one lying with his face downward: he surely will not receive thy offering.
5	5	5	'And if thou hast built him with his face upward--surely, a bird does not fly towards heaven with its face turned upward : he will not carry thee to heaven, he will not become conducive to heaven for thee.'
5	5	6	He said, 'I have built him with his face forward; I have built him with his face backward; I have built him with his face downward; I have built him with his face upward: I have built him in all directions.'
5	5	7	When he lays down the (gold) man with his head forward (eastward), and the two spoons (with their bowls) forward , thereby he (Agni) is built looking forward; and when he lays down thetortoise  with its head backward (westward), and the victims’ heads turned backward, thereby he is built looking backward; and when he, lays down the tortoise with its face downward, and the victims’ heads with their faces downward, and the bricks with their faces downward , thereby he is built looking downward; and when he lays down the (gold) man with his face upward, and the two spoons (with their open bowls) turned upward, and the mortar turned upward, and the fire-pan turned upward, thereby he is built looking upward; and when he lays down the bricks whilst moving round (the altar) in every direction, thereby he is built (looking) in all directions.
5	5	8	Now, the Koshas, whilst driving about, once drove up  to an Agni with his head pulled out . One of them said, 'The head (siras) means excellence (srî): he has pulled out his excellence, he will be deprived of his all!' and so indeed it happened to him.
5	5	9	And another said, 'The head means the vital airs: he has pulled out his vital airs, he will quickly go to yonder world!' and so, indeed, it happened to him.
5	5	10	Upwards, indeed, he (Agni) is built up, to wit, (in the shape of) the grass-bunch, the clod-bricks, the lotus-leaf, the gold plate and man, the two spoons, the naturally-perforated one, the grass-brick, the Dviyagus, the two Retahsik, the , the two seasonal bricks, the Ashâdhâ, and the tortoise; and that fire which is placed on the altar-pile, assuredly, is then most manifestly his (Agni's) head: let him therefore not pull out (the head).
6	1	1	Now at the house of Aruna Aupavesi  these came once together,--Satyayagña Paulushi, Mahâsâla Gâbâla, Budila Âsvatarâsvi, Indradyumna Bhâllaveya, and Ganasârkarâkshya. They took counsel together regarding (Agni) Vaisvânara, but did not agree as to Vaisvânara .
6	1	2	They said, 'There is that Asvapati Kaikeya who knows Vaisvânara thoroughly : let us go to him!' They went to Asvapati Kaikeya. He ordered for them separate dwellings, separate honours, separate Soma-sacrifices each with a thousand gifts. In the morning, still at variance with one another, theycame again to him, with fuel in their hands , saying, 'We want to become thy pupils.'
6	1	3	He said, 'How is this, venerable sirs, when ye are learned in the scriptures, and sons of men learned in the scriptures?' They replied, 'Venerable sir, thou knowest Vaisvânara thoroughly: teach us him!' He said, 'I do indeed know Vaisvânara thoroughly: put your fuel on (the fire), ye are become my pupils .'
6	1	4	He then said to Aruna Aupavesi, 'O Gautama, as whom knowest thou Vaisvânara ?'--'As Earth only, O king;' he replied.--'Yea,' he said, 'that indeed is Vaisvânara, the foundation; and because thou knowest the Vaisvânara Foundation (pratishthâ) therefore thou art firmly established (pratishthita) with offspring and cattle; and, verily, he who knows that Vaisvânara Foundation, repels Death and attains all life. But, in truth, these are only the feet  of Vaisvânara, and thy feet would have withered away, hadst thou not come hither; or the feet would be unknown to thee, hadst thou not come hither .'
6	1	5	He then said to Satyayagña Paulushi, 'O Prâkînayogya, as whom knowest thou Vaisvânara?' --'As Water only, O king;' he replied.--'Yea,' he said, 'that indeed is the Vaisvânara Wealth; and because thou knowest that Vaisvânara Wealth, therefore thou art wealthy and prosperous; and, verily, he who knows that Vaisvânara Wealth, repels death and attains all life. But, in truth, this is only the bladder of Vaisvânara, and thy bladder would have failed thee, hadst thou not come hither; or the bladder would be unknown to thee, hadst thou not come hither.'
6	1	6	He then said to Mahâsâla Gâbâla, 'O Aupamanyava, as whom knowest thou Vaisvânara?'--As Ether only, O king,' he replied.--'Yea,' he said, 'that, indeed, is the Vaisvânara Plenteous; and because thou knowest Vaisvânara Plenteous, therefore thou art plentiful in offspring and cattle; and, verily, he who knows that Vaisvânara Plenteous, repels death and attains all life. But, in truth, this is only the trunk of Vaisvânara, and thy trunk would have failed thee, hadst thou not come hither; or the body would be unknown to thee, hadst thou not come hither.'
6	1	7	He then said to  Âsvatarâsvi, 'O Vaiyâghrapadya, as whom knowest thou Vaisvânara?'--'As Air (wind) only, O king;' he replied.--'Yea,' hesaid, 'that indeed is the Vaisvânara of divers courses; and because thou knowest that Vaisvânara of divers courses, therefore divers rows of cars follow thee; and, verily, he who knows that Vaisvânara of divers courses, repels death, and attains all life. But, in truth, this is only the breath of Vaisvânara, and thy breath would have failed thee, hadst thou not come hither; or the breath would be unknown to thee, hadst thou not come hither.'
6	1	8	He then said to Indradyumna Bhâllaveya, 'O Vaiyâghrapadya, as whom knowest thou Vaisvânara?'--'As Sun only, O king,' he replied.--'Yea,' he said, 'that indeed is the Vaisvânara of Soma's splendour ; and because thou knowest the Vaisvânara of Soma's splendour, therefore that Soma-juice never fails to be consumed and cooked  in thy house; and, verily, he who knows that Vaisvânara of Soma's splendour, repels death, and attains all life. But, indeed, this is only the eye of Vaisvânara, and thine eye would have failed thee, hadst thou not come hither; or the eye would be unknown to thee, hadst thou not come hither.'
6	1	9	He then said to Gana Sarkarâkshya, 'O Sâyavasa, as whom knowest thou Vaisvânara?'--'As Heaven only, O king,' he replied.--'Yea,' he said, 'that indeed is Vaisvânara Pre-eminence; and because thou knowest the Vaisvânara Pre-eminence, therefore thou art pre-eminent among thine equals; and, verily, he who knows that Vaisvânara Preeminencerepels death, and attains all life. But, indeed, this is only the head of Vaisvânara, and thy head would have failed thee, hadst thou not come hither; or the head would have been unknown to thee, hadst thou not come hither.'
6	1	10	He said to them, 'Ye then, knowing different Vaisvânaras, have been feeding on different kinds of food; but verily, the well-beknown gods have attained, as it were, the measure of a span ; but I will so tell them unto you that I shall make them attain no more nor less than the measure of a span.'
6	1	11	Pointing at the head he said, 'This, indeed, is the Vaisvânara Pre-eminence;'--pointing at the eyes he said, 'This, indeed, is the Vaisvânara of Soma's splendour;'--pointing at the nostrils he said, 'This, indeed, is the Vaisvânara of divers courses;'--pointing at the space in the mouth he said, 'This, indeed, is the Vaisvânara Plenteous;'--pointing at the water in the mouth he said, 'This, indeed, is the Vaisvânara Wealth;'--pointing at the chin he said, 'This, indeed, is the Vaisvânara Foundation.' This Agni Vaisvânara is no other than the Purusha; and, verily, whosoever thus knows that Agni Vaisvânara as Purusha-like, as established within the Purusha, repels death, and attains all life; and, verily, Vaisvânara does no harm to him that speaks of him.
6	2	1	Now, indeed, there is this twofold thing, to wit, the eater and that which is eaten ; and when this pair meets it is called the eater, and not the eaten.
6	2	2	Now that eater is the same as this Agni (the fire and fire-altar); and whatever they assign to him is his assignments; and these assignments (âhiti) are mystically called oblations (âhuti), for the gods love the mystic.
6	2	3	And the eater, doubtless, is the sun, and his assignments (offerings) are the moon, for the moon is assigned to the sun . Thus much as to the deity.
6	2	4	Now as to the body. The eater, doubtless, is the breath, and its assignments are food, for the food is consigned to (the channel of) the breath. Thus much as to Agni.
6	2	5	Now as to the Arka (flame). The Arka, doubtless, is Agni; and his joy are the oblations, for the oblations are a joy  to Agni.
6	2	6	And the Arka, doubtless, is the sun; and his joy is the moon, for the moon is a joy to the sun. Thus much as to the deity.
6	2	7	Now as to the body. The Arka, doubtless, is the breath, and his joy is food, for food is a joy to (the channel of) the breath. Thus much as to the Arka.
6	2	8	Now as to the Uktha (song of praise). The 'uk,' doubtless, is Agni, and his 'tham' is oblations, for by oblations Agni rises (ut-thâ, i. e. blazes up).
6	2	9	And the 'uk,' doubtless, is the sun, and his 'tham' is the moon, for by the moon the sun rises. Thus much as to the deity.
6	2	10	Now as to the body. The 'uk,' doubtless, is the breath, and the 'tham' is food, for by food the breath rises (increases). Thus much as to the Uktha. That Agni-like, Arka-like, Uktha-like one is the same as the Purusha; and, verily, the enemy withers away of whosoever, knowing this, thus serves that Agni-like, Arka-like, Uktha-like Purusha.
6	2	11	The fire, indeed, is kindled by the breath, the wind by the fire, the sun by the wind, the moon by the sun, the stars by the moon, and the lightning by the stars :--so great, indeed, is the kindling both in this and in yonder world; and, verily, whosoever knows this is enkindled to that full extent both in this and in yonder world.
6	3	1	Let him meditate upon the 'true Brahman.' Now, man here, indeed, is possessed of understanding , and according to how great his understanding is when he departs this world, so does he, on passing away, enter yonder world.
6	3	2	Let him meditate on the Self, which is made up of intelligence, and endowed with a body of spirit, with a form of light, and with an etherial nature, which changes its shape at will, is swift as thought, of true resolve, and true purpose, which consists of all sweet odours and tastes, which holds sway over all the regions and pervades this whole universe, which is speechless and indifferent ;even as a grain of rice, or a grain of barley, or a grain of millet, or the smallest granule of millet, so is this golden  Purusha in the heart; even as a smokeless light, it is greater than the sky, greater than the ether, greater than the earth, greater than all existing things;--that self of the spirit (breath) is my self: on passing away from hence I shall obtain that self. Verily, whosoever has this trust , for him there is no uncertainty. Thus spake Sândilya, and so it is .
6	4	1	Verily, the dawn is the head of the sacrificial horse , the sun its eye, the wind its breath, Agni Vaisvânara (the fire belonging to all men) its open mouth. The year is the body of the sacrificial horse, the sky its back, the air its belly, the earth the under part of its belly, the quarters its flanks, the intermediate quarters its ribs, the seasons its limbs, the months and half-months its joints, the days and nights its feet, the stars its bones, the welkin its flesh, the sand its intestinal food, the rivers its bowels, the mountains its liver and lungs, the herbs and trees its hair, the rising sun the forepart, and the setting sun the hindpart of its body, the lightning its yawning, the thundering its whinnying, the raining its voiding urine, and speech its voice. The day, indeed, was produced as the Mahiman  (cup) before the horse, and its birthplace is in the eastern sea. The night was produced as the Mahiman (cup) behind (or after) it, and its birth-place was in the western sea: these two Mahiman (cups), indeed, came to be on both sides of the horse. As Haya (steed) it carried the gods, as Vagin (racer) the Gandharvas, as Aryan (courser) the Asuras, as Asva (horse) men. The sea, indeed, is its kindred, the sea its birth-place.
6	5	1	Verily, there was nothing here in the beginning: by Death this (universe) was covered, by hunger, for Death is hunger. He created for himself this mind, thinking, 'May I have a soul.' He went on worshipping. Whilst he was worshipping the waters were produced. 'Verily, to me worshipping (ark) water (kam) has been produced,' thus (he thought): this, indeed, is the Arka-nature of the Arkya ; and, verily, there is joy (kam) for him who thus knows the Arka-nature of the Arkya.
6	5	2	The Arka, doubtless, is the waters; and the cream (froth) which was on the waters was compacted, and became this earth. Thereon he wearied himself, and the glow and essence (sweat) of him thus wearied and heated developed into Fire.
6	5	3	He made himself threefold--(Agni being one-third), Âditya one-third, and Vâyu one-third: that is this threefold breath. The eastern quarter was his head, this and that (intermediate quarters) are his fore-feet, the western quarter his tail, this and that (intermediate quarters) his thighs, the southern and northern quarters his flanks; the sky his back, the air his belly, and this (earth) his chest:--on the waters he was established any and everywhere, and so indeed is he established who knows this.
6	5	4	He desired, 'May a second self be produced for me.' By his mind he entered into union with speech,--(to wit) Death with hunger: the seed which was produced became the year, for theretofore there was no year. For as long as the year he (Death) carried him (within him), and at the end ofthat time he produced him . He opened his mouth (to devour) the new-born one, and he (the child) cried 'bhân'; thus speech was produced.
6	5	5	He bethought him, 'Surely, if I kill him, I shall gain but little food .' By that speech and that soul of his he created all this (universe) whatsoever there is,--Rik (hymn-verses), Yagus (formulas), Sâman (hymn-tunes), metres, sacrifices, men, and beasts. And whatsoever he created he set about devouring; and because he eats (ad) everything, hence the name 'Aditi'; and, verily, he who thus knows the nature of Aditi becomes an eater of everything, and all food becomes his.
6	5	6	He desired, 'May I again sacrifice by yet another sacrifice.' He wearied himself and practised austerity. From him, thus wearied and heated, glory and vigour departed; and glory and vigour, indeed, are the vital airs. The vital airs having departed, that body of his began to swell. The mind was yet in the body;--
6	5	7	He desired, 'May this (body) of mine be sacrificially pure: may I thereby be possessed of a self!' Thereupon the horse (asva) was produced; and because that which was swelling  (asvat) became pure (medhya) therefore the name Asvamedha (belongs to that sacrifice). He, indeed, knows the Asvamedha who thus knows him .
6	5	8	He bethought him of leaving it unrestrained . At the end of a year he slaughtered it for his own self, and made over the (sacrificial) animals to the deities: therefore they slaughter the consecrated (victim) as one that, in its nature as Pragâpati, represents all the deities. But the Asvamedha, in truth, is he that shines yonder (the sun), and the year is his body. The Arka is this Fire, and these worlds are his bodies. These two are the Arka and Asvamedha; but these, indeed, become again one deity, to wit, Death. And, verily, whosoever knows this, conquers recurrent Death, and Death has no hold on him: Death is his own self; he attains all life, and becomes one of those deities.
6	5	9	Now the line of succession (of teachers). The same as far as Sâmgîvîputra. Sâmgîvîputra (received it) from Mândûkâyani, Mândûkâyani from Mândavya, Mândavya from Kautsa, Kautsa from Mâhitthi, Mâhitthi from Vâmakakshâyana, Vâmakakshâyana from Vâtsya, Vâtsya from Sândilya, Sândilya from Kusri, Kusri from Yagñavakas Râgastambâyana, Yagñavakas Râgastambâyana from Tura Kâvasheya, Tura Kâvasheya from Pragâpati, Pragâpati from Brahman (n.). Brahman is the self-existent: reverence be to Brahman!
