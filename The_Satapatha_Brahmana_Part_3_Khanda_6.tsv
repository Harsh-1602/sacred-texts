1	1	1	Verily, in the beginning there was here the non-existent . As to this they say, 'What was that non-existent?' The Rishis, assuredly,--it is they that were the non-existent . As to this they say, 'Who were those Rishis?' The Rishis, doubtless, were the vital airs: inasmuch as before (the existence of) this universe, they, desiring it, wore themselves out (rish) with toil and austerity, therefore (they are called) Rishis.
1	1	2	This same vital air in the midst doubtless is Indra. He, by his power (indriya), kindled those (other) vital airs from the midst; and inasmuch as he kindled (indh), he is the kindler (indha): the kindler  indeed,--him they call 'Indra' mystically (esoterically), for the gods love the mystic. They (the vital airs), being kindled, created seven separate persons  (purusha).
1	1	3	They said, 'Surely, being thus, we shall not be able to generate: let us make these seven persons one Person!' They made those seven persons one Person: they compressed two of them  (into) what is above the navel, and two of them (into) what is below the navel; (one) person was (one) wing (or side), (one) person was (the other) wing, and one person was the base (i.e. the feet).
1	1	4	And what excellence, what life-sap (rasa) there was in those seven persons, that they concentrated above, that became his head. And because (in it) they concentrated the excellence (srî), therefore it is (called) the head (siras). It was thereto that the breaths resorted (sri): therefore also it is the head (siras). And because the breaths did so resort (sri) thereto, therefore also the breaths (vital airs, and their organs) are elements of excellence (srî). And because they resorted to the whole (system) therefore (this is called) body (sarîra).
1	1	5	That same Person became Pragâpati (lord of generation). And that Person which became Pragâpati is this very Agni (fire-altar), who is now (to be) built.
1	1	6	He verily is composed of seven persons, for this Person (Agni) is composed of seven persons ,to wit, the body (trunk) of four, and the wings and tail of three; for the body of that (first) Person (was composed of) four, and the wings and tail of three. And inasmuch as he makes the body larger by one person, by that force the body raises the wings and tail.
1	1	7	And as to the fire which is deposited on the built (altar),--whatever excellence, whatever life-sap there was in those seven persons, that they now concentrate above, that is his (Pragâpati's) head. On that same (head) all the gods are dependent (srita), for it is there that offering is made to all the gods: therefore also it is the head (siras).
1	1	8	Now this Person Pragâpati desired, 'May I be more (than one), may I be reproduced!' He toiled, he practised austerity. Being worn out with toil and austerity, he created first of all the Brahman (neut.), the triple science. It became to him a foundation: hence they say, 'the Brahman (Veda) is the foundation of everything here.' Wherefore, having studied (the Veda) one rests on a foundation; for this, to wit, the Veda, is his foundation. Resting on that foundation, he (again) practised austerity.
1	1	9	He created the waters out of Vâk (speech, that is) the world; for speech belonged to it : that wascreated (set free). It pervaded everything here; and because it pervaded (âp) whatsoever there was here, therefore (it is called) water (âpah); and because it covered (var), therefore also it (is called) water (vâr).
1	1	10	He desired, 'May I be reproduced from these waters!' He entered the waters with that triple science. Thence an egg arose. He touched it. 'Let it exist! let it exist and multiply!' so he said. From it the Brahman (neut.) was first created, the triple science. Hence they say, 'The Brahman (n.) is the first-born of this All.' For even before that Person the Brahman was created : it was created as his mouth. Hence they say of him who has studied the Veda, that 'he is like Agni;' for it, the Brahman (Veda), is Agni's mouth.
1	1	11	Now the embryo which was inside was created as the foremost (agri): inasmuch as it was created foremost (agram) of this All, therefore (it is called) Agri: Agri, indeed, is he whom they mystically call  Agni; for the gods love the mystic. And the tear (asru, n.) which had formed itself   the 'asru' (m.): 'asru' indeed is what they mystically call 'asva' (horse), for the gods love themystic. And that which, as it were, cried  (ras), became the ass (râsabha). And the juice which was adhering to the shell (of the egg) became the he-goat (aga ). And that which was the shell became the earth.
1	1	12	He desired, 'May I generate, this (earth) from these waters!' He compressed it  and threw it into the water. The juice which flowed from it became a tortoise; and that which was spirted upwards (became) what is produced above here over the wafers. This whole (earth) dissolved itself all over the water: all this (universe) appeared as one form only, namely, water.
1	1	13	He desired, 'May it become more than one, may it reproduce itself!' He toiled and practised austerity; and worn out with toil and austerity, he created foam. He was aware that 'this indeed looks different, it is becoming more (than one): I must toil, indeed!' Worn out with toil and austerity, he created clay, mud, saline soil and sand, gravel (pebble), rock, ore, gold, plants and trees: therewith he clothed this earth.
1	1	14	This (earth), then, was created as (consisting of) these same nine creations. Hence they say, 'Threefold (three times three) is Agni;' for Agni is this (earth), since thereof the whole Agni (fire-altar) is constructed.
1	1	15	'This (earth) has indeed become (bhû) a foundation!' (he thought): hence it became the earth (bhûmi). He spread it out (prath), and itbecame the broad one (or earth, prithivî). And she (the earth), thinking herself quite perfect , sang; and inasmuch as she sang (gâ), therefore she is Gâyatrî. But they also say, 'It was Agni, indeed, on her (the earth's) back, who thinking himself quite perfect, sang; and inasmuch as he sang (gâ), therefore Agni is Gâyatra.' And hence whosoever thinks himself quite perfect, either sings or delights in song .
1	2	1	That Pragâpati desired, 'May it multiply, may it be reproduced!' By means (or, in the form) of Agni he entered into union with the Earth: thence an egg arose. He touched it: 'May it grow! May it grow and multiply!' he said.
1	2	2	And the embryo which was inside was created as Vâyu (the wind). And the tear which had formed itself became those birds. And the juice which was adhering to the shell became those sun-motes. And that which was the shell became the air.
1	2	3	He desired, 'May it multiply, may it reproduce itself!' By means of Vâyu he entered into union with the Air: thence an egg arose. He touched it, saying, 'Bear thou glory!' From it yonder sun was created, for he indeed is glorious. And the tear which (asru) formed itself became that variegated pebble (asman); for 'asru' indeed is whatthey mystically call 'asman,' for the gods love the mystic. And the juice which was adhering to the shell became those sunbeams. And that which was the shell became the sky.
1	2	4	He desired, 'May it multiply, may it reproduce itself!' By means of the Sun he entered into union with the Sky: thence an egg arose. He touched it, saying, 'Bear thou seed!' From it the moon was created, for he (the moon) is seed. And the tear which formed itself became those stars. And the juice which was adhering to the shell became those intermediate quarters; and that which was the shell became those (chief) quarters (points of the compass).
1	2	5	Having created these worlds, he desired, 'May I create such creatures as shall be mine in these worlds!'
1	2	6	By his Mind (manas) he entered into union with Speech (vâk): he became pregnant with eight drops. They were created as those eight Vasus : he placed them on this (earth).
1	2	7	By his Mind he entered into union with Speech: he became pregnant with eleven drops. They were created as those eleven Rudras : he placed them in the air.
1	2	8	By his Mind he entered into union with Speech: he became pregnant with twelve drops. They were created as the twelve Âdityas : he placed them in the sky.
1	2	9	By his Mind he entered into union with Speech: he became pregnant. He created the All-gods: he placed them in the quarters.
1	2	10	And so they say, 'After Agni having been created, the Vasus were created: he placed them on this (earth);--after Vâyu, the Rudras: (he placed) them in the air;--after the sun, the Âdityas: (he placed) them in the sky;--after the moon, the All-gods : he placed them in the quarters.'
1	2	11	And so they say, 'Pragâpati, having created these worlds, was firmly established on the earth. For him these plants were ripened  into food: that he ate. He became pregnant. From the upper vital airs he created the gods, and from the lower vital airs the mortal creatures.' In whatever way he created thereafter, so he created; but indeed it was Pragâpati who created everything here, whatsoever exists.
1	2	12	Having created creatures he, having run the whole race, became relaxed ; and therefore even now he who runs the whole race becomes indeedrelaxed. From him being thus relaxed, the vital air went out from within. When it had gone out of him the gods left him.
1	2	13	He said to Agni, 'Restore me!'--'What will then accrue to me?' said he.--'They shall call me after thee; for whichever of the sons succeeds (in life), after him they call the father, grandfather, son, and grandson: they shall call me after thee,--restore me, then!'--'So be it!' so (saying) Agni restored him: therefore, while being Pragâpati, they call him Agni; and verily, whosoever knows this, after him they call his father, grandfather, son, and grandson.
1	2	14	He said, 'Whereon shall we set thee up ?'--'On the hita (set, or suitable, good)!' he said: the vital air is indeed something good, for the vital air is good for all beings. And inasmuch as he set him up on the hita, therefore one says, 'I shall set up, I am setting up, I have set up .'
1	2	15	As to this they say, 'What is hita, and what is upahita?' The vital air, forsooth, is the 'hita,' and speech is the 'upahita,' for it is on the vital air that this speech is based (upa-hitâ). The vital air, again, is the 'hita,' and the limbs are the 'upahita,' for on the vital air these limbs are indeed based.
1	2	16	This, then, was his (Pragâpati's) 'kitya' (Agni to be set up on an altar-pile); for he had to be built up (ki) by him, and therefore was his 'kitya.' Andso indeed he now is the Sacrificer's 'kitya;' for he is to be built up by him, and therefore is his 'kitya.'
1	2	17	Now it was those five bodily parts (tanu) of his (Pragâpati's) that became relaxed,--hair, skin, flesh, bone, and marrow,--they are these five layers (of the fire-altar); and when he builds up the five layers, thereby he builds him up by those bodily parts; and inasmuch as he builds up (ki), therefore they are layers (kiti).
1	2	18	And that Pragâpati who became relaxed is the year; and those five bodily parts of his which became relaxed are the seasons; for there are five seasons, and five are those layers: when he builds up the five layers, he thereby builds him up with the seasons; and inasmuch as he builds up (lays down), therefore they are layers.
1	2	19	And that Pragâpati, the year, who became relaxed, is that very Vâyu (wind) who blows yonder. And those five bodily parts of his, the seasons, which became relaxed, are the regions (or quarters) ; for five in number are the regions, and five those layers: when he builds up the five layers, he builds him up with the regions; and inasmuch as he builds up, therefore they are layers.
1	2	20	And the Fire that is laid down on the built (altar), that is yonder Sun;--that same Agni is indeed (raised) on the altar, and that just because Agni had restored him (Pragâpati).
1	2	21	But they say,--Pragâpati, when relaxed, said to the gods, 'Restore me!' The gods said to Agni, 'In thee we will heal this our father Pragâpati.'-- 'Then I will enter into him, when whole,' he said.--'So be it!' they said. Hence, while being Pragâpati, they yet call him Agni.
1	2	22	In the fire the gods healed him by means of oblations; and whatever oblation they offered that became a baked brick and passed into him. And because they were produced from what was offered (ishta), therefore they are bricks (ishtakâ). And hence they bake the bricks by means of the fire, for it is oblations they thus make.
1	2	23	He spake, 'Even as much as ye offer, even so much is my happiness:' and inasmuch as for him there was happiness (ka) in what was offered (ishta), therefore also they are bricks (ishtakâ).
1	2	24	Here now Âktâkshya used to say, 'Only he who knows abundant bricks possessed of (special) prayers, should build up the fire (altar): abundantly indeed he then heals Father Pragâpati.'
1	2	25	But Tândya used to say, 'Surely the bricks possessed of prayers are the nobility, and the space-fillers  are the peasants; and the noble is the feeder, and the peasantry the food; and where there is abundant food for the feeder, that realm is indeed prosperous and thrives: let him therefore pile up abundant space-fillers!' Such then was the speech of those two, but the settled practice is different therefrom.
1	2	26	Now that father (Pragâpati) is (also) the son:inasmuch as he created Agni, thereby he is Agni's father; and inasmuch as Agni restored him, thereby Agni is his (Pragâpati's) father; and inasmuch as he created the gods, thereby he is the father of the gods; and inasmuch as the gods restored him, thereby the gods are his fathers.
1	2	27	Twofold verily is this,--father and son, Pragâpati and Agni, Agni and Pragâpati, Pragâpati and the gods, the gods and Pragâpati--(for) whosoever knows this.
1	2	28	He builds up with , 'By that deity'--that deity, doubtless, is Vâk (speech),--'Aṅgiras-like,'--Aṅgiras, doubtless, is the breath;--'lie thou steady!'--that is, 'lie thou firm;' or 'lie thou firmly established.' It is both with speech and with breath that he builds; for Agni is speech, and Indra is the breath; and the fire (agni) relates to Indra and Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus builds him up. And again, Indra and Agni are all the gods, (for) Agni belongs to all deities: thus as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus builds him up.
1	2	29	Here now they say, 'Wherefore is Agni (the fire-altar) built of this (earth)?' But, surely, when that deity (Pragâpati) became relaxed (fell asunder), he flowed along this (earth) in the shape of his life-sap; and when the gods restored him (put him together), they gathered him up from this earth: this earth then is that one brick , for Agni is this earth, sinceit is thereof  that the whole Agni is built up. Now this earth is four-cornered, for the quarters are her corners: hence the bricks are four-cornered; for all the bricks are after the manner of this earth.
1	2	30	As to this they say, 'But if he (Agni) thus consists of one brick, how then (comes he to be) a five-bricked  one?' Now surely the first brick of clay is this earth,--whatever made of clay he places on that (altar) that is that one brick. And when he puts thereon the heads of the animal victims , that is the animal-brick. And when he puts on the gold plate and man , when he scatters gold shavings thereon, that is the golden brick. And when he puts on two spoonfuls (of ghee)  when he puts on the mortar and pestle , and fire-sticks, that is the wood-brick. And when he puts on a lotus-leaf (petal), a tortoise , sour curds, honey, ghee, and whatever other food he puts on, that is the fifth brick, the food. Thus, then, it is a five-bricked (Agni).
1	2	31	As to this they say, 'On which side is the head of the brick?'--'Where he touches it and says a prayer,' so say some, 'on one end of the naturally perforated (brick)  alone indeed should hesay a prayer while touching it, but thus all those (bricks) of his are turned towards the naturally perforated one.' Let him not do so, for those bricks doubtless are his (Agni's) limbs, his joints; and it would be just as if he were to put a head on each limb, on each joint. But indeed, the fire which is deposited on the pile, that is the head of all those (bricks).
1	2	32	Here they say, 'How many animal victims are laid upon the fire (altar)?'--Let him say 'Five,' for he does lay thereon those five victims.
1	2	33	Or, 'One,' he may say; 'a ewe;' for a ewe (avi) is this earth, since she favours (av) all these creatures. And the fire (altar) also is this earth, for the whole fire (altar) is built up thereof: hence he may say, 'One.'
1	2	34	Or, 'Two,' he may say, 'two sheep;' for sheep, indeed, are both this (earth) and that (sky), since these two favour all these creatures;--what clay (there is in the brick) that is this earth; and what water there is that is that sky; and the bricks consist of clay and water: therefore he may say, 'Two.'
1	2	35	Or he may say, 'A cow (or bullock, go);--'the cow forsooth means these worlds, for whatever walks (gam) that walks in these worlds ; and thatfire also is these worlds: therefore he may say, 'A cow.'
1	2	36	As to this they say, 'For what object is this fire (altar) built? Having become a bird, he (Agni) shall bear me to the sky!' so say some; but let him not think so; for by assuming that form, the vital airs became Pragâpati ; by assuming that form, Pragâpati created the gods ; by assuming that form, the gods became immortal and what thereby the vital airs, and Pragâpati, and the gods became, that indeed he (the Sacrificer) thereby becomes.
1	3	1	Verily, Pragâpati alone was here in the beginning. He desired, 'May I exist, may I reproduce myself!' He toiled, he practised austerity (or, became heated). From him, worn out and heated, the waters were created: from that heated Person the waters are born.
1	3	2	The waters said, 'What is to become of us?'--'Ye shall be heated,' he said. They were heated; they created foam: hence foam is produced in heated water.
1	3	3	The foam (m.) said, 'What is to become of me?'--'Thou shalt be heated!' he said. It was heated, and produced clay; for indeed the foam is heated, when it floats on the water, covering it; and when one beats upon it, it indeed becomes clay.
1	3	4	The clay (f.) said, 'What is to become of me?'--'Thou shalt be heated!' he said. It was heated,and produced sand; for this clay becomes indeed heated when they plough it; and if only they plough very fine then it becomes, as it were, sandy. So much, then, as to that 'What is to become of me? what is to become of me ?'
1	3	5	From the sated he created the pebble: whence sand finally indeed becomes a pebble;--from the pebble the stone: whence the pebble finally indeed becomes a stone;--from the stone metal ore: whence from stone they smelt ore;--from ore gold: whence ore much smelted comes, as it were, to have the appearance of gold.
1	3	6	Now that which was created was flowing; and inasmuch as it was flowing (aksharat), a syllable (akshara) resulted therefrom; and inasmuch as it flowed eight times, that octosyllabic Gâyatrî was produced.
1	3	7	'This has indeed become (bhû) a foundation (resting-place),' so he thought: whence it became the earth (bhûmi). He spread it out (prath): it became the broad (earth, prithivî). On this earth, as on a foundation, the beings, and the lord of beings, consecrated themselves for a year: the lord of beings was the master of the house , and Ushas (the Dawn) was the mistress.
1	3	8	Now, those beings are the seasons; and that lord of beings is the year; and that Ushas, the mistress, is the Dawn. And these same creatures, as well as the lord of beings, the year, laid seedinto Ushas . There a boy (kumâra) was born in a year: he cried.
1	3	9	Pragâpati said to him, 'My boy, why criest thou, when thou art born out of labour and trouble?' He said, 'Nay, but I am not freed from (guarded against) evil; I have no name given me: give me a name!' Hence one should give a name to the boy that is born, for thereby one frees him from evil;--even a second, even a third (name), for thereby one frees him from evil time after time.
1	3	10	He said to him, 'Thou art Rudra .' And because he gave him that name, Agni became suchlike (or, that form), for Rudra is Agni: because he cried (rud) therefore he is Rudra. He said, 'Surely, I am mightier than that: give me yet a name!'
1	3	11	He said to him, 'Thou art Sarva.' And because he gave the him that name, the waters became suchlike, for Sarva is the waters, inasmuch as from the water everything (sarva) here is produced. He said, 'Surely, I am mightier than that: give me yet a name!'
1	3	12	He said to him, 'Thou art Pasupati.' And because he gave him that name, the plants became suchlike, for Pasupati is the plants: hence when cattle (pasu) get plants, then they play the master  (patîy). He said, 'Surely, I am mightier than that: give me yet a name!'
1	3	13	He said to him, 'Thou art Ugra.' Andbecause he gave him that name, Vâyu (the wind) became suchlike, for Ugra is Vâyu: hence when it blows strongly, they say 'Ugra is blowing.' He said, 'Surely, I am mightier than that: give me yet a name!'
1	3	14	He said to him, 'Thou art Asani.' And because he gave him that name, the lightning became suchlike, for Asani is the lightning: hence they say of him whom the lightning strikes, 'Asani has smitten him.' He said, 'Surely, I am mightier than that: give me yet a name!'
1	3	15	He said to him, 'Thou art Bhava.' And because he gave him that name, Parganya (the rain-god) became suchlike; for Bhava is Parganya, since everything here comes (bhavati) from the rain-cloud. He said, 'Surely, I am mightier than that: give me yet a name!'
1	3	16	He said to him, 'Thou art Mahân Devah (the Great God).' And because he gave him that name, the moon became suchlike, for the moon is Pragâpati, and Pragâpati is the Great God. He said, 'Surely, I am mightier than that: give me yet a name!'
1	3	17	He said to him, 'Thou art Îsâna (the Ruler).' And because he gave him that name, the Sun became suchlike, for Îsâna is the Sun, since the Sun rules over this All. He said, 'So great indeed I am: give me no other name after that!'
1	3	18	These then are the eight forms of Agni. Kumâra (the boy) is the ninth: that is Agni's threefold state .
1	3	19	And because there are eight forms of Agni--the Gâyatrî consisting of eight syllables--therefore they say, 'Agni is Gâyatra.' That boy entered into the forms one after another; for one never sees him as a mere boy (kumâra), but one sees those forms of his , for he assumed those forms one after another.
1	3	20	One ought to build him (Agni, the fire-altar) up in (the space of) a year, and recite for a year. 'For two (years),' however, say some; 'for in one year they laid the seed, and in one year that boy was born, therefore let him build for two (years), and recite for two (years).' Let him, however, build for a year only, and recite for a year; for the same seed which is laid is brought forth; it then lies changing and growing: hence let him build for a year only, and recite for a year. To him (Agni) when built up (kita) he gives a name: whereby he keeps away evil from him. He calls him by a bright (kitra) name , saying, 'Thou art bright;' for Agni is all bright things.
2	1	1	Pragâpati set his mind upon Agni's forms. He searched for that boy (Kumâra) who had enteredinto the (different) forms. Agni became aware of it,--'Surely, Father Pragâpati is searching for me: well then, let me be suchlike that he knows me not.'
2	1	2	He saw those five animals,--the Purusha (man), the horse, the bull, the ram, and the he-goat. Inasmuch as he saw (pas) them, they are (called) cattle (pasu).
2	1	3	He entered into those five animals; he became those five animals. But Pragâpati still searched for him.
2	1	4	He saw those five animals. Because he saw (pas) them, therefore they are animals (pasu); or rather, because he saw him (Agni) in them, therefore they are animals.
2	1	5	He considered, 'They are Agni: I will fit them unto mine own self . Even as Agni, when kindled, glares, so their eye glares; even as Agni's smoke rises upwards, so vapour rises from them; even as Agni consumes what is put in him, so they devour; even as Agni's ashes fall down, so do their faeces: they are indeed Agni; I will fit them unto mine own self.' He meant to slaughter them for different deities: the Purusha (man) for Visvakarman, the horse for Varuna, the bull for Indra, the ram for Tvashtri, the he-goat for Agni.
2	1	6	He considered, 'For different deities, indeed, I mean to slaughter now; but I myself desire (kam) Agni's forms: well then, I will slaughter them for the Agnis, as for the (object of my) desire.' He slaughtered them for the Agnis, as for (his) desire,--to wit, 'for the Agnis,' because many were the forms of Agni he had set his mind upon; and 'for the desire,' because it was with a desire that he slaughtered them. Having appeased them and carried the fire round them, he led them northwards and slew them.
2	1	7	He considered, 'Those glories (signs of excellence ) upon which I have set my mind are contained in the heads: well then, I will only put on the heads .' He cut off the heads and put them on (himself, or the altar). The remaining trunks he then let float on the water  , and brought the sacrifice to its completion by means of (the offering of) a he-goat, thinking, 'Lest my sacrifice be pulled to pieces.' After performing that animal sacrifice, Pragâpati saw that he had not yet reached the end of Agni (the fire-altar).
2	1	8	He considered, 'I must search for that body  which I let float on the water.' He searched for it; and what (part) of those (bodies) cast into the water had settled therein, that water he gathered; and what (had settled) in this earth, that clay (he gathered) . And having gathered both that clayand water, he made a brick: hence a brick consists of these two, clay and water.
2	1	9	He considered, 'Surely, if I fit  this (matter) such as it is unto mine own self, I shall become a mortal carcase, not freed from evil: well then, I will bake it by means of the fire.' So saying, he baked it by means of the fire, and thereby made it immortal; for the sacrificial food which is baked by fire is indeed immortal (or, ambrosia). Hence they bake the bricks with fire: they thereby make them immortal.
2	1	10	And inasmuch as he saw them after offering (ishtvâ) the animal, therefore they are bricks (ishtakâ). Hence one must make the bricks only after performing an animal sacrifice; for those which are made before (or, without) an animal sacrifice are 'anishtakâ .' And, moreover, there is this other (consideration).
2	1	11	As to those glories, they are these same heads of the victims; and those (headless) trunks are these five layers (of the fire-altar): thus when he builds up the layers after putting on the heads of the victims, he thereby unites those trunks with those heads.
2	1	12	And because Agni is all those animal victims, therefore animals delight (being) near the fire ,--there animals sport with animals. Hence the (sacrificial) fire is set up with him who possesses cattle; for inasmuch as Agni (was) the same as cattle, therefore Pragâpati (the lord of creatures or generation) became Agni.
2	1	13	Here now some say, 'It is at this (point of the performance) that he should offer up all those (five) victims; for had Pragâpati then offered up all of them, he would certainly have reached the end of the fire (altar): hence were he (the Sacrificer) now to offer up all those (victims) he would certainly reach the end of the fire (altar).' Let him not do so: he thus would stray from where the gods have gone, he would stray from the path;--and what would he then gather ? For those same bodies, those layers, he gathers: let him therefore not do so.
2	1	14	Now when he slaughters those animals, he prepares a home for Agni; for nowhere but in his home does one enjoy himself. But the home means food: it is that he lays down in, front, and when Agni sees that, he turns unto him.
2	1	15	There are a man, a horse, a bull, a ram, and a he-goat; for such are all the animals (used for sacrifice). Animals are food: he thus lays down in front whatever food there is; and seeing that, Agni turns unto him.
2	1	16	There are five; for there are those five Agnis,to wit, the five layers (of the fire-altar): for them he thus lays down five homes; and seeing that, Agni turns unto him.
2	1	17	And when (he offers) 'to the Agnis,'--it is because there are here many Agnis, to wit, those layers; and when (he offers) 'to the desire,' it is in order that the Sacrificer may obtain the object for which he performs that ceremony.
2	1	18	A man (purusha) he slaughters first, for man is the first of animals; then a horse, for the horse comes after man; then a bull, for the bull (or cow) comes after the horse; then a ram, for the sheep comes after the cow; then a he-goat, for the goat comes after the sheep: thus he slaughters them according to their form, according to their excellence.
2	1	19	Their ropes may be unequal; that of the man being the longest, then shorter and shorter: thus he makes the ropes according to the form of the animals, to avoid confusion between good and bad. But let them be all alike, all similar; for all these victims are alike, all similar, for they are (all) called Agnis, they are called food: hence they are alike and similar.
2	1	20	Here now they say, 'How is that complete five-bricked fire of his gained in the animals?'--Well, in the kapâlas of the sacrificial cakes that first brick, the earthen one, is obtained; and when he slaughters the animal, thereby the animal brick is obtained, and when two gold chips are (placed) on both sides of the omentum, thereby the gold brick is obtained; and what firewood, stake, and enclosing sticks there are, thereby the wooden brick is obtained; and what ghee, sprinkling-water, and cake there are, thereby the fifth brick, the food, isobtained: thus then that complete five-bricked fire of his is gained in the animals.
2	1	21	For these (victims) there are twenty-four kindling-verses ; for the year consists of twenty-four half-moons, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus kindles him.
2	1	22	And, again, why there are twenty-four,--the Gâyatrî consists of twenty-four syllables, and Agni is Gâyatra : as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus kindles him.
2	1	23	And, again, why there are twenty-four,--man (purusha) doubtless is twenty-fourfold: ten fingers of the hands, ten toes, and four limbs; and Pragâpati is the Purusha, and Pragâpati is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus kindles him.
2	1	24	He recites both gâyatrî and trishtubh verses; for the gâyatrî metre is the vital air, and the trishtubh is the body (self): by the gâyatrî verses he thus kindles his vital air, and by the trishtubh ones the body. The trishtubh verses are in the middle, and the gâyatrî verses on both sides thereof; for this body is in the middle, and the (organs of) the vital airs are on the sides thereof. He pronounces more gâyatrî verses before, and fewer after (thetrishtubh verses); for there are more (organs of the) vital airs in front, and fewer behind.
2	1	25	He recites , 'May the months , O Agni, may the seasons make thee grow!' When Agni restored the relaxed Pragâpati, he (Pragâpati) said to him, 'What kindling-verses there are equal to me (in measure), with them kindle me!'
2	1	26	He (Agni) saw these (verses), 'May the months, O Agni, may the seasons make thee grow!' that is, 'May both the months, O Agni, and the seasons make thee grow!'--'The years, the Rishis, whatsoever truths' that is, 'May the years, and the Rishis, and the truths make thee grow!'--'With heavenly brightness do thou shine!'--the heavenly brightness doubtless is yonder sun: thus 'together with that do thou shine!'--'lighten up the whole four regions!' that is, 'lighten up all the four regions!'
2	1	27	These (verses) have one and the same explanation regarding him (Agni-Pragâpati): how one would make him complete, how he would restore and produce him. They relate to Agni and Pragâpati: to Agni, inasmuch as Agni saw (them); to Pragâpati, inasmuch as he (Agni) kindled Pragâpati.
2	1	28	Twelve Âprî (propitiatory) verses  there are,--twelve months are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus propitiates (or gratifies) him.
2	1	29	And, again, why there are twelve,--of twelve syllables consists the Gagatî, and the Gagatî is this earth, for on her there is everything that moves (gag-at) here. And Agni also is this earth, for it is out of her that the whole fire (altar) is built up: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus propitiates him.
2	1	30	And, again, why there are twelve,--of twelve syllables consists the Gagatî, and the Gagatî is all the metres, and all the metres are Pragâpati (the sacrifice), and Pragâpati is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus propitiates him.
2	1	31	Those 'kindling-sticks of his (Agni) are upright.' When Agni restored the relaxed Pragâpati, he said to him, 'What Âprî-verses there are equal to me, with them propitiate me!'
2	1	32	He saw these (verses) :--'Upright are his kindling-sticks,' for upright indeed are the kindling-sticks of him when kindled;--'upwards tending the bright flashes of Agni,' for tending upwards are his bright flashes, his flames;--'they, the most brilliant,' that is 'the most powerful;'--'of the fair-looking son,' for fair-looking indeed Agni is on all sides; and inasmuch as he (the Sacrificer) produces him thereby he (Agni) is his son.
2	1	33	These (verses) have one and the same explanation regarding him (Agni-Pragâpati): how one would make him complete, how he would restore and produce him. They relate to Agni and Pragâpati,--to Agni, inasmuch as Agni saw (them); to Pragâpati, inasmuch as he (Agni) propitiated Pragâpati.
2	1	34	They are unequal, and consist of unequal feet, and unequal syllables; for the metres are unequal: whatever unequal limbs there are at his (Agni's) body, those (limbs) of his he propitiates by these (verses).
2	1	35	The animal cake belongs to (Agni) Vaisvânara--Vaisvânara being all the fires--for the obtainment of all the fires.
2	1	36	As to why it belongs to Vaisvânara;--those layers (of the altar) no doubt are the seasons, for the seasons are the fires; and the seasons are the year, and the year is Vaisvânara (belonging to all men). Were it (offered) to Agni (Vaisvânara), he would cause it (the formula) to be redundant. It is one on twelve potsherds: twelve months are a year, and the year is Vaisvânara. The offering and invitatory formulas relate to Agni, for the obtainment of Agni's forms. They contain the word 'kâma' (desire), for the obtainment of his desires.
2	1	37	Now some, having in that way  obtained those heads, put them on (the fire-altar), thinking, 'Either way  are they animals.' But they (who do this) become mortal carcases, for unpropitiated arethose (heads) of theirs. In this way, indeed, they did put them on for Ashâdhi Sausromateya ; but quickly indeed he died after that.
2	1	38	Some, however, make gold ones, saying, 'They are immortal bricks (amriteshtakâ).' But indeed those are false bricks (anriteshtakâ), those are no heads of victims.
2	1	39	Some, again, make earthen ones, thinking, 'Passed away, forsooth, are these animals, and this earth is the shelter of all that has passed away: thus whither those animals have gone, from thence we collect them.' Let him not do so, for whoso knows not both the practice and theory of these (victims), for him let them be passed away. Let him slaughter those very five victims, as far as he may be able to do so; for it was these Pragâpati was the first to slaughter, and Syâparna Sâyakâyana the last; and in the interval also people used to slaughter them. But nowadays only these two are slaughtered, the one for Pragâpati, and the one for Vâyu. The theory of these two is now (to be) told.
2	2	1	The Karakas slaughter (a he-goat) for Pragâpati, saying, 'Pragâpati, having built up the fire-altar (agni), became Agni. When he slaughters that one, then indeed he reaches the end of Agni (the fire-altar).'
2	2	2	It is a dark grey one; for the grey has two kinds of hair, the white and the black; and two make a productive pair: that is its Pragâpati-characteristic. It is a hornless one, for Pragâpati is hornless.
2	2	3	For this (animal sacrifice) there are twenty-one kindling-verses ;--twelve months, five seasons, these three worlds, and yonder sun,--that is the twenty-onefold Pragâpati; and Pragâpati is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus kindles him.
2	2	4	And, again, why there are twenty-one;--man (purusha) doubtless is twenty-onefold, ten fingers of the hand, ten toes, and the body (make) the twenty-onefold man Pragâpati; and Pragâpati is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus kindles him.
2	2	5	He recites both gâyatrî and trishtubh verses: their significance has been told; and (what applies to) the order of the verses has been told. The libation of ghee  he makes with the verse containing (the name) Hiranyagarbha ; for Hiranyagarbha.is Pragâpati, and Pragâpati is Agni. There are twelve Âprî-verses: their significance has been told; and (what applies to) the order of the verses has been told. The animal cake belongs to Pragâpati, for the relation of the victim is also that of the animal cake . It is one on twelve potsherds: twelve months are a year, and the year is Pragâpati. The offering and invitatory formulas contain the word 'Ka,' for Pragâpati is Ka .
2	2	6	He then slaughters for Vâyu Niyutvat (the wind, driving a team of horses) that white, bearded (he-goat). When Pragâpati had produced living beings, he looked about him, and from exceeding delight his seed fell: it became that white, hornless, bearded he-goat (aga, 'unborn'); for seed is life-sap, and as far as there is life-sap, so far extends the self. And when he slaughters that one, then indeed he reaches the end of Agni (the fire-altar). It is a white one, because seed is white. It is hornless, because seed is hornless. It belongs to Vâyu, because Vâyu (the wind) is the out-breathing; and to Niyutvat, because the teams (niyut ) are the in-breathing: the out-breathing and in-breathing he thus lays into him.
2	2	7	And, again, why he slaughters that white, hornless (he-goat);--when the gods restored the relaxed Pragâpati, they, by means of this victim, put into him that out-breathing which had gone out of him; and in like mariner this one now puts it into him. It belongs to Vâyu, because Vâyu is the out-breathing; and to Niyutvat, because the teams are the in-breathing: he thus puts the out-breathing and in-breathing into him. It is white, because Vâyu (the wind) is white; and it is hornless, because Vâyu is hornless.
2	2	8	For this (animal sacrifice) there are seventeen kindling-verses ; for the year is seventeenfold--there are twelve months and five seasons--Pragâpati is the year, and Pragâpati is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus kindles him.
2	2	9	And, again, why there are seventeen,--man is seventeenfold,--there are ten vital airs, four limbs, the body the fifteenth, the neck-joints the sixteenth, and the head the seventeenth,--Pragâpati is the Person (or man, purusha), and Pragâpati is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus kindles him.
2	2	10	He recites both gâyatrî and trishtubh verses: their significance has been told; and (what applies to) the order of the verses has been told. There are twelve Âprî-verses: their significance has been told; and (what applies to) the order of the verses has been told. The animal cake belongs to Pragâpati: 'Therein then that wish was obtained,' Mâhitthi once said,--'which the Karakâs say is in the victim to Pragâpati.'
2	2	11	And as to why the victim belongs to Vâyu, and the animal cake to Pragâpati;--one half of Pragâpati doubtless is Vâyu, and one half is Pragâpati: thus, were they both to belong to Vâyu, or both to Pragâpati, then only one half of him (Pragâpati) would be made up, and one half would not (be made up). But in that the victim belongs to Vâyu, and the animal cake to Pragâpati, thereby he puts together (restores) him, Pragâpati, wholly and entirely.
2	2	12	And, again, why the victim belongs to Vâyu, and the animal cake to Pragâpati;--when the gods restored the relaxed Pragâpati, they, by means of this victim, put into him that out-breathing which had gone out of him; and by means of this cake they restored that body (trunk) of his. And as to why it belongs to Pragâpati, it is because the body (self) is Pragâpati; and (why it is) one on twelve potsherds,--twelve months are a year, and Pragâpati is the year. One of the offering prayers and one of the invitatory prayers  contain (the word) 'ka,' for Pragâpati is Ka.
2	2	13	Now when in the first place he offers the omentum, he thereby puts into him (Pragâpati) that vital air which is here in front. And when they proceed with that (cake) in the middle, it is because this trunk is in the middle. And when they proceed thereafter with the (meat) oblation, he thereby puts into him that vital air which is behind. The (remaining) offering and invitatory prayers should contain the word 'bright,' with the view of the obtainment of bright forms; and the word 'niyut' (team), for the obtainment of that form which has a team .
2	2	14	As to this they say, 'It is rather the two (prayers) of the Omentum that should contain (the word) "bright," for so far as the two (prayers) of the omentum containing (the word) "bright" extend, extends what is bright in the animal (sacrifice); and the two (prayers) of the (meat) oblation should contain (the word) "team," for the obtainment of that form of him (Pragâpati) which has a team.'
2	2	15	And, again, why he slaughters this animal;--in this animal doubtless the form of all (the five kinds of) animals is (contained): inasmuch as it is hornless and bearded, that is the form of man, for man is hornless and bearded; inasmuch as it is hornless and furnished with a mane, that is the form of the horse, for the horse is hornless and furnished with a mane; inasmuch as it is eight-hoofed, that is the bull's form, for the bull is eight-hoofed; inasmuch as its hoofs are like those of the sheep, that is the form of thesheep; and inasmuch as it is a he-goat, that is that of the goat. Thus when he slaughters this one, thereby indeed all those (five) animals are slaughtered for him. Whichever of these may suit him--either those five animals, or that (he-goat) for Pragâpati, or that one for (Vâyu) Niyutvat --
2	2	16	Let him slaughter it at full moon. 'Let him slaughter at new moon,' so say some, 'for Pragâpati is yonder moon: during that night (of new moon) he dwells here (on earth) , and it would be just as if he slaughtered him while staying near.'
2	2	17	But, indeed, this (takes place) at full moon, for the victim is yonder moon, and him the gods slaughter at full moon : 'I will slaughter him at the time when the gods slaughter him,' thus he thinks, and therefore (he does so) at full moon. And, again, why at full moon;--the full moon nodoubt was the first to shine forth, hence also (the sacrifice takes place) at full moon.
2	2	18	And furthermore, at the Phâlguna (full moon), for that full moon of Phâlguna, that is, the second (Phâlguna) , is the first night of the year; and that first (Phâlguna) is the last (night of the year): he thus begins the year at the very mouth (beginning).
2	2	19	Now, as soon as he has performed the full-moon offering, let him slaughter the victim. For Indra, having driven away Vritra, evil, by means of the full-moon offering, thus freed from evil entered upon this sacrificial performance; and in like manner the Sacrificer, having driven away Vritra, evil, by means of the full-moon offering, thus freed from evil now enters on this (sacred) performance.
2	2	20	This is (performed) in a low voice, for by means of these victims Pragâpati sought to obtain this (sacred) work ; but that (work) was then, as it were, uncertain, indistinct: hence in a low voice.
2	2	21	And, again, why in a low voice;--this performance assuredly belongs to Pragâpati, for it is Pragâpati he enters upon by this performance; and Pragâpati is undefined.
2	2	22	And, again, why in a low voice;--there is seed here in the sacrifice, and seed is cast silently--theomentum, the animal cake, and the chief oblation, for of that much consists the animal sacrifice.
2	2	23	On the eighth day (after full moon) he collects (the materials for) the fire-pan; for sacred to Pragâpati is that day, the eighth (after full moon), and sacred to Pragâpati is this (sacred) piece of work, the fire-pan: on a day sacred to Pragâpati he thus performs the work sacred to Pragâpati.
2	2	24	And as to why (it is performed) on the eighth day;--that eighth day no doubt is a joint of the year, and that fire-pan is a joint of Agni (the fire-altar): he thus makes joint upon joint.
2	2	25	And, again, why on the eighth day;--eightfold doubtless is the pan --the bottom part, the two side-parts, the horizontal belt (or rim), that makes four; and four upright (bands), that makes eight: he thus makes the eightfold on the eightfold (or eighth).
2	2	26	He performs the initiation on the day of new moon; for from out of the new moon the sacrifice is spread: 'Whence the sacrifice is spread, thence will I generate the sacrifice,' so he thinks.
2	2	27	And, again, why he (does so) at new moon;--when he performs the initiation, he verily pours out his 'own self, as seed, into the fire-pan, the womb; and when he becomes initiated, he makes for it (his self) that world (or place) beforehand , and he isborn into the world made by him: hence they say, Man is born into the world made (by him) .'
2	2	28	Now, were he to be initiated during less than a year, he would build up bricks without space (for them) : the bricks would exceed the spaces. And if, after making more spaces , he were not to fill up bricks in accordance therewith, the spaces would exceed the bricks. And when, after initiating himself at new moon, he buys (Soma) at new moon , he piles up as many bricks as he (during the interval) makes space for; and when his (Agni's second) wing is covered (with loose soil), the whole Agni is built up.
2	2	29	As to this they say, 'If at the time of the buying (of Soma) the days and nights (of the initiation-period) amount to just as many as there are bricks of that fire-altar, why then are not thosespaces of his filled up (which are prepared) during the days there are after the buying (of Soma) ? Well, when he buys (Soma) at new moon, after becoming initiated at new moon (a year previously), then he piles up just as many bricks as (during that interval) he makes space for; and what days there then are after the buying (of Soma), during that interval the Adhvaryu builds up the fire-altar. But when should he build up, if there were not that interval? As many as there are days and nights in the year, so many are the bricks of that fire-altar. Thereto (comes) a thirteenth month, for there is that thirteenth month;--thus during the days there are after the buying (of Soma), those spaces of it (the altar) are filled up afterwards with those bricks of the thirteenth month: thus the spaces and the bricks become equal.
2	2	30	Thus, then, what first full moon there is (in the year) on that he slaughters the victim; and what first eighth-day there is, on that he prepares the fire-pan; and what first new moon there is, on that he becomes initiated: thus whatever first days there are in the year, of those he thereby takes possession for him (Agni, the altar), those he thereby gains. Now then as to the total amount (of the fire-altar) .
2	2	31	Here now they say, 'How does that sacrificial performance of his (the animal sacrifice) gain the year, Agni? how does it correspond  with the year, with Agni?' Well, for those five victims there are twenty-five kindling-verses, twelve Âprî-verses,--that makes thirty-six;--eleven after-offerings, eleven by-offerings ,--that makes fifty-eight.
2	2	32	Now what forty-eight there are (in these fifty-eight), they are the Gagatî (metre) consisting of forty-eight syllables;--the Gagatî doubtless is this earth, for it is thereon that everything is that moves (gagat); and Agni also is this earth, for it is thereof that the whole Agni is built up: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become .
2	2	33	And, again, why there are forty-eight;--of forty-eight syllables consists the Gagatî; the Gagatî (comprises) all the metres; all the metres are Pragâpati (the sacrifice ); and Pragâpati is Agni as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.
2	2	34	And what (remaining) ten there are (in those fifty-eight), they are the Virâg, consisting of ten syllables; and the Virâg is Agni,--there are ten regions, and the regions are Agni; ten vital airs, and the vital airs are Agni: as great as Agni is,as great as is his measure, so great does this become.
2	2	35	The omentum and the animal cake, that makes sixty;--sixty are the days and nights of a month: thus he gains the month; the month gained gains the season; and the season (gains) the year: he thus gains the year, Agni, and the wishes which are contained in the year, and what other food than that there is in the year, all that (he gains).
2	2	36	And for that (victim) of Pragâpati there are twenty-one kindling-verses, and twelve Âprî-verses, that makes thirty-three;--eleven after-offerings, eleven by-offerings, that makes fifty-five;--omentum, animal cake, and chief oblation, that makes fifty-eight: whatever wish is contained in the fifty-eight, that he gains even here ;--two libations of ghee, that makes sixty: whatever wish is contained in the sixty, that he gains even here; and what other food than that there is in the year, all that (he gains).
2	2	37	And for that (victim) of (Vâyu) Niyutvat, there are seventeen kindling-verses, and twelve Âprî-verses, that makes twenty-nine;--eleven after-offerings, and eleven by-offerings, that makes fifty-one;--omentum, animal cake, and chief oblation, that makes fifty-four;--two libations of ghee, two (oblations to Agni) Svishtakrit, that makes fifty-eight: whatever wish is contained in the fifty-eight, that he gains even here;--the wood-lord  (tree) and the oblation of gravy, that makes sixty: whatever wish is containedin the sixty, that he gains even here, and what other food than that there is in the year, all that (he gains); and thus that sacrificial performance gains for him the year, Agni; thus it (the animal sacrifice) corresponds with the year, with Agni.
2	2	38	As to this they say, 'Of that animal he should offer no Samishtayagus, nor should he go down with the heart-spit to the purificatory bath ; for that animal (sacrifice) is the commencement of Agni; the Samishtayagus are the gracious dismissal of the deities ; and the purificatory bath is the completion;--lest he should at the very commencement dismiss the deities, and complete the sacrifice.' Let him nevertheless complete (the sacrifice): Pragâpati, having offered that animal, saw that he had not reached the end of him, Agni,--let him therefore complete (the sacrifice). And, again, why he completes it;--that animal sacrifice is his vital air, and if anything were to cut him off from that, it would cut him off from the vital air; and if anything were to cut him off from the vital air, he would thus die: let him therefore complete (the sacrifice). Now, then, as to the vows (rites of abstinence).
2	2	39	Here now they say, 'After he has performed that animal offering, he must not sleep upon (a couch), nor eat flesh, nor hold carnal intercourse; for that animal sacrifice is the first Dîkshâ, and improper surely it would be, were the initiated to sleep upon (a couch), or were he to eat flesh, or hold carnal intercourse.' But in no way is this a Dîkshâ, for there is neither a girdle, nor a blackantelope skin ; but he makes this the first brick : let him therefore, if he like, sleep upon (a couch); and whatever food animals here eat, all that is here obtained and taken possession of by him; and whatever kinds of food there are other than honey, of all those he may eat at pleasure, if he can get them. Carnal intercourse, however, he may not hold prior to the (offering of) clotted curds to Mitra and Varuna : the purport of this (will be explained) hereafter.
2	2	40	Here now they say, 'At this sacrifice he should give a Dakshinâ (sacrificial gift); thinking, "Lest my sacrifice should be without a dakshinâ!" let him give to the Brahman the prescribed dakshinâ, for the Brahman is the entire sacrifice: thus the entire sacrifice of his becomes healed.' Let him not do so; for he makes this a brick, and it would be just as if he were to give a present with each brick: only at that (proper) time  let him therefore give what it befits him (to give).
2	3	1	Now, the gods said, 'Meditate ye!'--whereby, no doubt, they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer  (for the fire-altar)! 'Whilst they were meditating, Pragâpati saw this earth, as a first naturally-perforated  layer: hence it is by means of Pragâpati that he lays on that (brick) .
2	3	2	Agni said to him (Pragâpati), 'I will step nigh!'--'Wherewith?'--'With cattle!'--'So be it!' He thereby doubtless meant to say, 'with the cattle-brick;' for that cattle-brick is the same as the dûrvâ-brick : hence the dûrvâ-brick is laid so as not to be separated from the first naturally-perforated one; hence also not separated from this earth are the plants, the cattle, the fire,--for not separated (from the earth)  he (Agni) stepped nigh with this (brick).
2	3	3	They said, 'Meditate ye yet!' whereby no doubt they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer! seek ye (to build) from hence upwards!' Whilst they weremeditating, Indra and Agni, and Visvakarman saw the air, as a second naturally-perforated layer: hence he lays on that (brick ) by means of Indra and Agni, and Visvakarman.
2	3	4	Vâyu said to them, 'I will step nigh!' Wherewith!'--'With the regions!'--'So be it!' He thereby doubtless meant to say, 'with the regional (bricks ):' hence on the second naturally-perforated one the regional ones are laid, without being separated from it ; and hence not separated from the air are the regions, the wind; for not separated therefrom he (Vâyu) stepped nigh with this (brick).
2	3	5	They said, 'Meditate ye yet!'--whereby no doubt they said, 'Seek ye a layer! seek ye (to build) from hence upwards!' Whilst they were meditating, Parameshthin saw the sky, as a third naturally-perforated layer: whence it is by Parameshthin (the most high) he lays on that (brick ).
2	3	6	Yonder Sun said to him, 'I will step nigh!'--'Wherewith?'--'With a space-filling (brick ).'--'So be it!'--Now he (the sun) indeed is the space-filler: 'by (mine own) self,' he thus means to say. Hence the third naturally-perforated one is laid on so as not to be separated from the space-filling one ; and hence yonder sun is not separated from the sky, for not separated therefrom did he step nigh with this (brick).
2	3	7	These six deities forsooth became all this (universe), whatsoever exists here. The gods and the Rishis said, 'Those six deities forsooth have become all this (universe): bethink ye yourselves how we also may share therein!' They said, 'Meditate ye!' whereby doubtless they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer! seek ye how we also may share in this ! Whilst they were meditating, the gods saw a second, the Rishis a fourth, layer .
2	3	8	They said, 'We will step nigh!'--'Wherewith?'--'With what is over and above these worlds!'--'So be it!' Now what there is above the earth on this side of the air, therewith the gods stepped nigh, that is this second layer; and what thereis above the air on this side of the sky, therewith the Rishis stepped nigh, that is this fourth layer.
2	3	9	Now when they said, 'Meditate ye (ketayadhvam)!' they doubtless meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer (kitim ikkhata)!' and inasmuch as meditating (ketay) they saw them, therefore they are 'layers' (kitayah).
2	3	10	Pragâpati saw the first layer: Pragâpati assuredly is its (spiritual) ancestry. The gods saw the second layer: the gods assuredly are its ancestry. Indra and Agni, and Visvakarman saw the third layer: they assuredly are its ancestry. The Rishis saw the fourth layer: the Rishis assuredly are its ancestry. Parameshthin saw the fifth layer: Parameshthin assuredly is its ancestry. And, verily, whosoever so knows that (spiritual) ancestry of the structures (layers of the fire-altar), his structures are indeed possessed of an ancestry, possessed of relations (or, of mystic significance, bandhu).
3	1	1	The gods then said, 'Meditate ye!' whereby doubtless they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer!' Whilst they were meditating, Savitri saw those Sâvitra (formulas); and inasmuch as Savitri saw them, they are called Sâvitra. He offered that eightfold-taken libation; and when he had offered it, he saw this eightfold-appointed Ashâdhâ , which had been created aforetime.
3	1	2	Now when they said, 'Meditate ye!' they doubtless meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer!' and inasmuch as they saw it whilst meditating (ketay), therefore it is a layer (kiti). And the libation is a sacrifice; and inasmuch as he saw it after sacrificing (ishtvâ), it is a brick (ishtakâ).
3	1	3	Now that same (libation of ghee), while being a single one, he offers as an eightfold one  with eight formulas: whence this ('invincible' brick), while being a single one, is eightfold appointed.
3	1	4	He offers while raising upwards (the spoon);--he thereby raises this earth upwards by means of its forms : whence this earth is raised (above the water) by its forms.
3	1	5	He offers it continuously;--for at that time the gods were afraid lest the Rakshas, the fiends, should come thither after them! They saw that continuous libation for preventing the Rakshas, the fiends, from coming after them: hence he offers it continuously.
3	1	6	And, again, why he offers that libation;--this Agni is Savitri, and him he gratifies at the outset by this libation; and having sacrificed to, and gratified, him (Agni), he then puts him together. And inasmuch as by this (libation) he gratifies Savitri, they (the formulas are called) Sâvitra: that is why he offers this libation.
3	1	7	And, again, why he offers this libation;--this Agni is Savitri, and him he pours out as seed at the outset by this libation; and whatlike seed is poured into the womb suchlike (offspring) is born. And inasmuch as by this (libation) he pours out Savitri as seed, they (the offering-formulas are called) Sâvitra: that is why he offers this libation.
3	1	8	Both an offering-spoon (sruk) and a dipping-spoon (sruva) are used thereat; for the offering-spoon is speech, and the dipping-spoon is breath; and with speech and breath the gods sought this sacred rite at the beginning: hence there are an offering-spoon and a dipping-spoon.
3	1	9	And, again, why there are an offering-spoon and a dipping-spoon,--what Pragâpati was, that indeed is this dipping-spoon, for the dipping-spoon is the breath, and the breath is Pragâpati. And what Vâk (speech) was, that is this offering-spoon; for Vâk is a female, and the offering-spoon (sruk, f.) is a female; and those waters which went forth from the world of Vâk (speech) , they are this (ghee) which he offers (in) this libation.
3	1	10	He offers it continuously, for those waters flowed continuously. And inasmuch as that Pragâpati entered the waters with the threefold science , that is these prayers (yagus) with which this (priest) now offers.
3	1	11	The first three which there are, are these (three) worlds; and what fourth prayer there is thatis the threefold science, that is the Gagatî,--the Gagatî being all the metres, and all the metres (making up) the threefold science; and what last four (prayers) there are, they are the quarters: now Pragâpati indeed is those worlds and the quarters; and that (gagatî verse in the middle) is the threefold science.
3	1	12	He offers with , 'Harnessing first the mind,'--Pragâpati, assuredly, is he that harnesses, he harnessed the mind for that holy work; and because he harnessed the mind for that holy work, therefore he is the harnessing one.
3	1	13	'Savitri, stretching out the thoughts,'--for Savitri is the mind, and the thoughts are the vital airs;--'gazing reverently at Agni's light,'--that is, having seen Agni's light;--'bore up from the earth;' for upwards from the earth he indeed bears this (offering).
3	1	14	'With harnessed mind we,'--he thereby harnesses the mind for this work, for with unharnessed mind one cannot now do anything;--'at the impulse of the god Savitri,'--that is impelled (sped) by the god Savitri,--'with power (we strive) for the heavenly;'--'that by this holy work he may go to the heavenly world,' he thereby means to say; 'with power,' he says, for by power (energy) one goes to the heavenly world.
3	1	15	'Savitri, having harnessed the gods,'--Savitri is the mind, and the gods are the vital airs;--'going by thought to the light, to heaven,'--for as such as are going to the heavenly world by thought (devotion) he has harnessed them for this holy work;--'going to produce a mighty light,'--the mighty light assuredly is yonder sun, andhe is this Agni, and him they are indeed going to fit together (or, restore);--'may Savitri speed them!'--that is, 'may they perform this holy work, sped by Savitri.'
3	1	16	'They harness the mind, and they harness the thoughts,'--for both the mind and the vital airs he harnesses for this holy work;--'the priests of the priest,'--the priest is Pragâpati, and the priests are the gods;--'of the great inspirer of devotion,'--the great inspirer of devotion  is Pragâpati;--'he hath assigned the priestly offices,'--now when he (Agni-Pragâpati) is built up, then he assigns the priestly offices, for the priestly offices are assigned over the built-up (fire-altar);--'the finder of rites,'--for he indeed found this rite;--'he alone,' for he alone found this whole holy rite;--'mighty is the praise of the god Savitri,'--that is, 'great is the praise of the god Savitri.'
3	1	17	'By devotions I harness your old inspiration,'--the old inspiration (brahman) doubtless is the vital air, and devotion is food, and that food is this oblation: by means of this oblation, by means of this food, he harnesses the vital airs for this holy work,--'May the praise spread abroad on the lord's path,'--this he says in order that there may be for the Sacrificer the praise of fame among both gods and men;--'may all sons of the immortal hear!'--the immortal one doubtless is Pragâpati, and his sons are all the gods;--'who have resortedto the heavenly abodes;'--the heavenly abodes are these worlds: the gods that are in these worlds, with regard to them he says this.
3	1	18	'Whose course the others have followed,'--for Pragâpati first performed this rite, whereupon the gods performed it;--'the gods with vigour, the god's greatness,'--the greatness is the sacrifice, thus: 'the gods with vigour (followed) the god's sacrifice, his energy;'--'that dappled steed who hath measured the terrestrial (regions),'--whatsoever is on this earth that is terrestrial, all that he measures out; for with his rays he reaches down to it;--'the regions, he the god Savitri by his greatness,'--the regions are these worlds, and the god Savitri is yonder sun: he measures them by his greatness.
3	1	19	'God Savitri, speed the sacrifice, speed the lord of sacrifice unto his share!'--the god Savitri is yonder sun, and his share is the sacrifice, that he means to say when he says 'speed the sacrifice, speed the lord of sacrifice!'--'May the heavenly, thought-cleansing Gandharva cleanse our thought!'--the heavenly Gandharva is yonder sun, and thought is (sacrificial) food; thus, 'May the food-cleanser cleanse our food!'--'May the lord of speech render agreeable our speech!'--this sacred rite is speech, and the lord of speech is the breath: thus, 'May the breath render agreeable this rite of ours!!
3	1	20	'Further, O god Savitri, this our sacrifice!'--the god Savitri is yonder sun, and whatever sacrificial rite he furthers, thatreaches its end safely and auspiciously;--'as one pleasant to the gods,'--that is, as one which shall please the gods;--'friend-gaining, ever-winning, wealth-winning, heaven-winning,'--that is, one that may gain all this;--'Make the hymn-tune successful with the rik (verse), the Rathantara with the Gâyatra (metre), and the Brihat, moving in Gâyatra measures!'--thus the sâmans (hymns);--'Hail!' thus the sacrificial formulas: this threefold science is first produced, even as it was there and then produced. And the Agni who was produced, he is this Agni (fire-altar) who is built up from hence upwards.
3	1	21	These then are the eight Sâvitra (formulas );--the Gâyatrî has eight syllables, and Agni is Gâyatra: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by just so much he pours him out as seed. There are nine of them, the call of 'Hail' (being) the ninth,--there are nine regions, and Agni is the regions; nine vital airs, and Agni is the vital airs: as great as Agni is, as great as is. his measure, by so much he pours him out as seed. There are ten of them, the libation (being) the tenth,--the Virâg has ten syllables, and Agni is Virâg (the widely shining ); there are ten regions, and Agni is the regions; ten vital airs, and Agni is the vital airs: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.
3	1	22	This libation having been offered, Agni went away from the gods. The gods said, 'Agni is thecattle (or, an animal), let us search for him by means of the (different kinds of) cattle: he will become manifest unto his own form.' They searched for him by means of the cattle, and he became manifest to his own form: and hence even to this day the animal becomes manifest to its own form (kind) , cow to cow, horse to horse, and man to man.
3	1	23	They said, 'Surely, if we search with all of them, they will become used up and affording no livelihood; and if not with all, we shall get him (Agni) incomplete.' They saw one animal (as a substitute) for two animals , namely, the ass (as a substitute) for the cow and the sheep; and because they saw that one beast (would do) for two beasts, therefore that one (the he-ass), whilst being one, doubly impregnates .
3	1	24	The sham-man  (they saw to be a substitute) for man,--a sham-man doubtless is he who pleases neither the gods, nor the fathers, nor men. Thus they searched by means of all the beasts, and yet they (the beasts) did not come to be used up and affording no livelihood.
3	1	25	With three he searches,--Agni is threefold: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus searches for him. They are fiveby way of (mystic) correspondence ,--Agni (the fire-altar) has five layers; five seasons are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.
3	1	26	They are fastened with halters of reed-grass to guard (Agni) against injury ;--Agni went away from the gods; he entered into a reed, whence it is hollow, and whence inside it is, as it were, smoke-tinged: (thus) that, the reed, is Agni's womb, and Agni is these cattle; and the womb does not injure the child. For  it is from a womb that he who is born is born: 'from the womb he (Agni) shall be born when he is born,' thus he thinks.
3	1	27	They (the halters) are triple (strings), for Agni is threefold. They are made like a horse's halter, for the horse's halter lies all round the mouth, and the womb lies all round the child: thus it is made like the womb.
3	1	28	They (the animals) stand facing the east, first the horse, then the ass, then the he-goat; for thisis their proper order. For that horse (asva) is the tear (asru) which there (at the creation) formed itself; and that ass (râsabha) is that which, as it were, cried (ras); and that he-goat (aga, unborn) is the juice which adhered to the shell; and that clay which they are about to fetch is nothing else than the shell (of the egg): for it was from these forms that he was created at first , and from them he thus produces him.
3	1	29	They stand on the south side;--for the gods at that time were afraid, lest the Rakshas, the fiends, should smite their sacrifice from the south. They saw that thunderbolt, yonder sun; for this horse is indeed yonder sun; and by means of that thunderbolt they drove off the Rakshas, the fiends, from the south, and spread this sacrifice in a place free from danger and devilry. And in like manner does the Sacrificer now by this thunderbolt drive off the Rakshas, the fiends, from the south, and spread this sacrifice in a place free from danger and devilry.
3	1	30	On the right (south) side is the Âhavanîya fire, and on the left (north) lies that spade; for the Âhavanîya (m.) is a male, and the spade (abhri, f.) a female, and the male lies on the right side of the female .  at a cubit's distance, for at a cubit's distance the male lies by the female.
3	1	31	It should be made of bamboo. Agni went away from the gods. He entered into a bamboo-stem; whence that is hollow. On both sides he made himself those fences, the knots, so as notto be found out; and wherever he burnt through, those spots came to be.
3	1	32	It (the spade) should be spotted, for such a one is of Agni's nature. If he cannot procure a spotted one, it may be unspotted, but hollow it must be, to guard (Agni) from injury ;--(for) such a one alone is of Agni's nature; that, the bamboo, is Agni's womb; and this (lump of) clay is Agni; and the womb does not injure the child. For it is from a womb that he who is born is born: 'from the womb he (Agni) shall be born when he is born,' so he thinks.
3	1	33	It may be a span long, for the voice here speaks but as far as a span's distance . It is, however, a cubit long, for the cubit is the arm, and strength is exerted by the arm: it thus becomes equal to his strength.
3	1	34	It may be sharp on one side only, for on one of the two sides is there a keen edge to this speech of ours . But indeed it is one that is sharp on both sides, for on both sides is there a keen edge to this speech of curs, inasmuch as it speaks both what is divine and what is human , and both truth and untruth: therefore it is one that is sharp on both sides.
3	1	35	And, again, why it is sharp on both sides,--the strength of the spade doubtless is on that side on which there is its sharp edge: he thus lays strength into it on both sides.
3	1	36	And, again, why it is sharp on both sides,--when the gods had there discovered him (Agni), they dug him out from these worlds; and in like manner does he now, after discovering him, dig him out from these worlds.
3	1	37	When it digs thus (downwards), then it digs him out from this world; and when it moves upwards, then from yonder world; and when it moves about between the two, then from the air-world: it thus digs him out from all these worlds.
3	1	38	He takes it up, with , 'At the impulse of the god Savitri, I take thee by the arms of the Asvins, by the hands of Pûshan, by the Gâyatrî metre, Aṅgiras-like!' By means of those deities he thus takes it up, impelled by Savitri; by the Gâyatrî metre: he thus imparts the Gâyatrî metre to it. 'From the Earth's seat, Aṅgiras-like, bring thou Agni Purîshya !'--now soil means cattle: thus, 'from the earth's lap bring thou Agni, favourable to cattle, as Agni (did)!'--'by the Trishtubh metre, Aṅgiras-like!' he thereby takes it with the Trishtubh metre and thus lays into it the Trishtubh metre.
3	1	39	'A spade thou art,'--for a spade it is: he thus takes it by means of the truth;--'A woman thou art!'--the spade is a thunderbolt, and the woman is a female, and a female injures no one: he thus appeases it so as not to do any injury. 'By thee may we be able to dig out Agni in the seat!' the seat no doubt is this (spot): thus, 'By thee may we be able to dig out Agni in this seat (place).'--'By the Gagatî metre, Aṅgiras-like!' he thus takes it up by means of the Gagatî metre, and lays the Gagatî metre into it.
3	1	40	With three (formulas) he takes it up,--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus takes it. Having taken it up with three (formulas), he addresses it with a fourth; for the gods having thus taken it with three (formulas), then laid vigour into it by means of a fourth; and in like manner does he now, after taking it up with three (formulas), lay strength into it with the fourth.
3	1	41	'Having taken into his hand, Savitri,'--for it has indeed been taken into his (the Adhvaryu's) hand,--'bearing the spade,'--for he indeed bears it,--'the golden,'--for golden indeed is the one that consists of the metres (the Veda);--'beholding Agni's light,'--that is, seeing Agni's light,--'lifted it up from the earth,'--for he indeed lifts it up from the earth;--'by the Anushtubh metre, Aṅgiras-like;'--he thus takesit up by means of the Anushtubh metre, and lays the Anushtubh metre into it: for his undertaking that spade of bamboo is thus made to be those metres.
3	1	42	Some, indeed, make it of gold, saying, 'It is spoken of as golden.' Let him not do so: in that it is the metres, thereby that (spade) is gold, immortal gold, the immortal metres.
3	1	43	He takes it up with four (formulas), for all speech consists of four syllables: 'vâk' (speech) is one syllable, and 'aksharam' (syllable) consists of three syllables. Now that monosyllable 'vâk' is the same as this last one, the Anushtubh; and that trisyllable 'aksharam' is the same as those former formulas: he thus digs up Agni by the whole speech, and equips it with the whole speech,--hence with four (formulas).
3	1	44	And, again, why with four (formulas);--there are four quarters: he thus lays speech into the four quarters, whence speech speaks in the four quarters. He takes it up both by metres and by formulas, that makes eight--there are four quarters, and four intermediate quarters: he thus lays speech into all the quarters, whence speech speaks in all the quarters.
3	2	1	The spade is still in his hand, when he addresses the beasts. For when the gods at that time were about to search (for Agni) in these (animals) they placed their vigour in front; and in like manner doesthis one, now that he is about to search in these (animals), place his vigour in front.
3	2	2	He addresses the horse, with , 'Most speedily , O courser, run hither,'--what is swift, that is speedy, and what is swifter than swift, that is most speedy;--'along the widest range,'--the widest range doubtless is this (earth): thus, 'along this wide range;'--'in the sky is thy highest home, in the air thy navel, upon earth thy womb:' he thus makes it to be those deities, Agni, Vâyu, and Âditya (the sun), and thus lays vigour into the horse.
3	2	3	Then the ass, with , 'Yoke ye two the ass,' he says this to the Adhvaryu and the Sacrificer;--'upon this course, ye showerers of wealth!'--that is, 'upon this performance, ye showerers of wealth;'--'him, bearing Agni, and helpful  unto us;'--that is, 'him, bearing Agni, and urged forward by us:' he thereby lays vigour into the ass.
3	2	4	Then the he-goat, with , 'At every yoking, at every race, we call him, the most powerful,'--race  means food: thus, 'in every performance, in respect of every food we call him, the most powerful;'--'Indra to our help, we his friends!'--that is, 'him, the strong (indriyavat), to our help:' he thereby lays vigour into the he-goat.
3	2	5	With three (formulas) he addresses (the victims),--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, asgreat as is his measure, by so much he thus lays vigour into them.
3	2	6	He then makes them walk forward to the east: he thus searches for him (Agni) by means of these animals. He does not touch (them) lest he, Agni, should injure him; for Agni is the same as the animals .
3	2	7	He makes the horse walk on, with , 'Forth-speeding, come treading down the curses!'--curse means evil: thus, 'running come, treading down the evil!'--'come, delighting, into Rudra's chieftainship!'--beasts belong to Rudra: thus, 'come thou, delighting, into the chieftainship of him who is thy deity!' he thus searches for him by means of the horse.
3	2	8	Then the ass with, Traverse the wide air, thou possessed of prosperous pastures and affording safety!'--as the text, so its meaning;--'with Pûshan as thy mate;'--Pûshan, doubtless, is this earth; thus, 'together with her as thy mate:' he thus searches for him by means of the ass.
3	2	9	Then the he-goat, with , 'From the Earth's seat, Aṅgiras-like, bring thou Agni Purîshya!'--that is, 'from the Earth's lap bring thou Agni, favourable to cattle, as Agni (did)!' he thus searches for him (Agni) by means of the he-goat.
3	2	10	With three (animals) he searches,--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus searches for him. By three (formulas) he first addresses (the beasts); that makes six,--six seasons are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.
3	3	1	Those fires have been kindled (afresh); and they (the priests and sacrificer) betake themselves to the lump of clay ;--those fires doubtless are these worlds: when they are kindled, then they are these worlds. For formerly the gods were seeking this sacred rite outside of these worlds; and when he fetches the lump of clay after passing by those fires, he is seeking him (Agni) outside of these worlds.
3	3	2	They go eastwards; for the east is Agni's region: he thus seeks him in his own region, finds him in his own region.
3	3	3	They go forward, with, 'Aṅgiras-like, we go to Agni Purîshya;'--that is, 'like Agni, we are going to Agni, favourable to cattle.'
3	3	4	He then looks at the sham-man, with, 'Aṅgiras-like, we shall carry Agni Purîshya;'--that is, 'Like Agni, we shall carry Agni, favourable to cattle:' he thus searches for him by means of the sham-man.
3	3	5	Thereupon a hollow ant-hill is laid down midways (between the lump of clay and the Âhavanîya fire). He looks along it ; for the ant-hill is thisearth, and this earth is these worlds. For the gods searched for him (Agni) in these worlds part by part; and in like manner does this one now search for him in these worlds part by part.
3	3	6	'Agni hath looked along the crest of the Dawns,'--thereby they sought him in the dawns;--'along the days, he, the first knower of beings,'--thereby they sought him in the days;--'and oftentimes along the rays of the sun,'--thereby they sought him in the rays of the sun;--'along the sky and the earth hast thou spread;'--therewith they sought him in the sky and the earth, and found him; and in like manner does this one thereby find him (Agni). When he sees him from afar, he throws down that (ant-hill); and they go up to the lump of clay.
3	3	7	He then addresses the horse; for the gods then said, 'Let us drive away his evil!' Now evil is weariness: thus, 'Let us drive away his weariness, the evil!' They drove away his weariness, the evil; and in like manner does this one now drive away his weariness, the evil.
3	3	8	'The courser, having started on his way,'--for his way has indeed been started upon;--'shaketh off all assaults,'--assaults mean evils: thus, 'shakes off all evils;' and hence, indeed, the horse, whilst running, shakes itself;--'Agni he seeks to descry with his eye on the great seat;'--the great seat doubtless is this sacrificial (place): thus, 'Agni he wishes to see with his eye on this great seat.'
3	3	9	He then makes it (the horse) step on (the lump of clay with the left fore-foot); for having discovered him (Agni), it (the horse) then indicatedhim to the gods, as if (it meant to say) , 'Just here he is!'
3	3	10	And, again, why he makes it step thereon;--the gods then were afraid, thinking, 'We hope the Rakshas, the fiends, will not slay here this our (Agni)!' They placed that thunderbolt upon him as a protector, to wit, yonder sun; for that horse is indeed yonder sun; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer, or priest) now place upon him that thunderbolt as a protector.
3	3	11	'Having come upon the earth, O courser, seek thou Agni by thy light!'--the light is the eye: thus, 'Having come to the earth, thou, O courser, seek Agni with thy eye!'--'by pawing  the ground tell us where we may dig him out!'--that is, 'by pointing out that (spot) of the ground tell us where we may dig him out.'
3	3	12	He then pulls it up ; for the gods now endowed it with vigour (for) having indicated (Agni) to them; and in like manner does this one now endow it with vigour (for) having indicated (Agni) to him. He does so, with , 'The sky is thy back, the earth thy resting-place, the air thy body, the sea thy womb;'--whereby he says, 'Suchthou art, such thou art;'--'Looking about with thine eye, tread down the assailers!'--that is, 'Looking about with thy eye, tread down all evildoers!' He does not touch it, lest this thunderbolt should injure him, for the horse is a thunderbolt .
3	3	13	He then makes it step off (the lump of clay);--for the gods now said, 'What shall we cause it to obtain ?'--'Great beauty !'--They caused it to obtain great beauty; and in like manner does this one now cause it to obtain great beauty,--with , 'Go thou unto great beauty!'--that is, 'Go to thy great beauty!' and therefore, indeed, the horse is the most highly-favoured of animals;--'from this standing-place,'--that is, 'where thou now standest;'--'wealth-giver!'--for wealth it does give them;--'Courser!'--for this is a courser;--'May we be in the Earth's favour, whilst Agni we dig in her lap!'--that is, 'May we be in the favour of this earth, whilst digging (for) Agni in her lap!'
3	3	14	When it has stepped off he addresses it;--for as one would extol him who has given a gift, so the gods now praised and magnified it (for) having indicated (Agni); and in like manner does this one now praise and magnify it, with , 'He hath come down,'--for it has indeed come down,--'the wealth-giver,'--for wealth, indeed, is given them; 'the racing courser,'--for it is indeed a racer and a courser;--'hath made good, well-made room on earth,'--that is, 'thou madest good, well-made room on earth;'--'thence let usdig out the fair-looking Agni,'--'fair-looking,' he says, for Agni is indeed fair-looking on every side;--'ascending the heaven, unto the highest sky,'--the sky is the heavenly world: thus, 'mounting the heavenly world, unto the highest sky.' He makes it come up on the right side (of the lump) to where the two other beasts are: they stand on the right side, facing the east. The significance of the right-hand (southern) position here is the same as it was on that former occasion.
3	3	15	Sitting down he now offers upon the lump of clay;--for the gods then said, 'Meditate ye (ketay),' whereby, doubtless, they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer (kiti)!' Whilst meditating they saw this libation, and offered it: after offering it, they saw the fire-pan (representing) these worlds.
3	3	16	They said, 'Meditate ye!' whereby, doubtless, they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer!' Whilst meditating they saw this second libation, and offered it: after offering it, they saw the Visvagyotis (all-light bricks), that is, those deities Agni, Vâyu, and Âditya; for these deities are indeed all the light. And in like manner does the Sacrificer now, after offering those two libations, see the fire-pan, these worlds; and those all-light deities. He offers with two interlinked (verses) : he thereby interlinks these worlds, and those deities.
3	3	17	And, again, why he offers these two libations;--he thereby gratifies both the clay and the water; and having offered to, and gratified, these two, he then brings them together. With two interlinked (verses) he offers: he thereby interlinks (combines thoroughly) the clay and the water.
3	3	18	He offers with ghee; for the ghee is a thunderbolt: he thus makes the thunderbolt its (or his, Agni's) protector. The ghee, moreover, is seed: he thus pours forth seed,--with the sruva-spoon; for the sruva (m.) is a male, and the male pours forth seed,--with 'Svâhâ (hail!),' for the Svâhâkâra (m.) is a male, and the male pours forth seed.
3	3	19	'Upon thee I sprinkle with thought, with ghee,'--that is, 'upon thee I offer with thought and ghee;'--'that dwellest near all beings,'--for he (Agni) indeed comes to dwell near every being;--'thee, large and great with side-spent force,'--for large he is, and directed sideways, and great with force, with smoke;--'most ample through food, and fierce to look at,'--that is, 'capacious with food, a consumer of food, and flaming.'
3	3	20	'From all sides I sprinkle the hitherward looking,'--that is, 'from every side I offer upon the hitherward looking;'--'with spiteless mind let him relish this,'--that is, 'with unchafing mind may he relish this;'--'Agni, glorious as a wooer, and of pleasing colour,'--for Agni is indeed glorious as a wooer  and of pleasing colour;--'not to be touched, while raging with his body,'--for not to be touched is he, whilst flaming with his body.
3	3	21	With two (verses) he offers; for the Sacrificeris two-footed, and the Sacrificer is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus pours him forth as seed;--with two (verses) relating to Agni: it is Agni he thereby pours forth as seed. Inasmuch as they relate to Agni, they are Agni; and inasmuch as they are Trishtubhs, they are Indra; and Agni (the fire) belongs to Indra and Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus pours him forth as seed. Moreover, Indra and Agni are all the gods, and Agni (thus) contains all deities: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus pours him forth as seed.
3	3	22	He offers on the horse's footprint;--the horse is the same as that Agni, and so, indeed, these two libations come to be offered over Agni.
3	3	23	He draws lines around it (the lump, with the spade): he thereby puts a measure to it (or, to him, Agni), as if saying, 'So great thou art!'
3	3	24	And, again, why he draws a line around it;--the gods now were afraid, thinking, 'We hope the Rakshas, the fiends, will not smite here this (Agni) of ours!' They drew that rampart round it; and in like manner does this one now draw that rampart round it,--with the spade, for the spade is the thunderbolt, and he thus makes the thunderbolt its (or his, Agni's) protector. He draws it all round: on every side he thus makes that thunderbolt to be its (or his) protector . Three times he draws a line: that threefold thunderbolt he thus makes to be a protector for him.
3	3	25	'Around the wise lordof strength-- ,' 'Around (us) we (place) thee, O Agni, as a rampart-- ,' 'With the days, thou Agni-- ,' in thus praising Agni he makes a fence for him by means of (verses) containing the word 'pari' (around), for all round, as it were, (run) the ramparts;--(he does so by verses) relating to Agni: a stronghold of fire he thus makes for him, and this stronghold of fire keeps blazing;--(he does so) by three (verses): a threefold stronghold he thus makes for him; and hence that threefold stronghold is the highest form of strongholds. Each following (circular) line he makes wider, and with a larger metre: hence each following line of strongholds is wider, for strongholds (ramparts) are lines.
3	3	26	He then digs for him (Agni)  in this earth. For the gods then were afraid, thinking, 'We hope the Rakshas, the fiends, will not smite him here ! For the sake of protection they made this earth to be a self (body, âtman) for him, thinking, 'His own self will protect his own self.' It (the lump of clay) should be as large as the hole: thus this earth (or clay) becomes his (Agni's) self. And as to its (being) as large as the hole,--this earth is the womb, and this (clay) is teed; and whatever part of the seedexceeds the womb, becomes useless; and what is deficient, is unsuccessful; but that part of the seed which is within the hole is successful. Four-cornered is this hole, for there are four quarters: from all the (four) quarters he thus digs him.
4	1	1	He now digs it (the lump of clay)  up from that (hole);--for the gods, having found him (Agni), then dug him up; and in like manner this one, after finding him, now digs him up,--with , 'At the impulse of the god Savitri, by the arms of the Asvins, by the hands of Pûshan, I dig thee, the Agni Purîshya, from the lap of the earth, Aṅgiras-like;'--impelled by Savitri, he thus, by means of those deities, digs him up, the Agni favourable to cattle, as Agni (did).
4	1	2	'Thee, O Agni, the bright, the fair-faced,'--for this Agni is indeed bright and fair-faced;--'glowing with perpetual sheen,'--that is, 'shining with perpetual light;'--'thee, kind to creatures, and never harming, the Agni Purîshya we dig up from the lap of the earth, Aṅgiras-like;'--that is, thee, kind to creatures, and never harming, the cattle-loving Agni we dig up from the lap of the earth, as Agni (did).'
4	1	3	With two (formulas) he digs,--two-footed is the Sacrificer, and the Sacrificer is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus digs him up. And twofold also is that form of his, (consisting as it does of) clay and water.
4	1	4	He digs, with, 'I dig,'--'we dig;' for with, 'Idig,' Pragâpati dug for him (Agni); and with, 'we dig,' the gods dug for him, therefore (he digs), with, 'I dig,'--'we dig.'
4	1	5	Now while digging with the spade, he says with speech 'I dig,' 'we dig,' for the spade is speech. It is for his undertaking that this bamboo (spade) is made; and with speech for a spade, the gods dug him up; and in like manner does this one now dig him up with speech for a spade (or, with the speech-spade).
4	1	6	He then deposits it upon the black antelope skin, for the black antelope skin is the sacrifice : in the sacrifice he thus deposits it (or him, Agni);--on the hair (side); for the hair is the metres: he thus deposits him on the metres. That (skin) he spreads silently; for the black antelope skin is the sacrifice; and the sacrifice is Pragâpati, and undefined is Pragâpati. North (of the hole he spreads it),--the meaning of this (will be explained) hereafter;--on (the skin spread) with the neck-part in front, for thus (it is turned) towards the gods.
4	1	7	And he deposits it on a lotus-leaf (placed on the skin); for the lotus-leaf is the womb, and into the womb he pours that seed; and the seed which is poured into the womb, becomes generative. He spreads that (leaf) with a formula; for the formula is speech, and the lotus-leaf is speech .
4	1	8	'Thou art the waters’back, Agni's womb,' for this is indeed the back of the waters, and the womb of Agni;--'around the swelling sea,'--for the sea indeed swells around it;--'thou, growing mighty upon the lotus,'--that is, 'growing, prosper thou on the lotus.'--'With the measure of the sky, extend thou in width!'--with this he strokes along it (so as to lie even on the skin); for that Agni is yonder sun; and him assuredly none other than the width of the sky can contain: 'having become the sky, contain him!' this is what he thereby says.
4	1	9	He spreads it over the black antelope skin; for the black antelope skin is the sacrifice; and the black antelope skin is this earth, and the sacrifice is this earth, for on this earth the sacrifice is spread. And the lotus-leaf is the sky; for the sky is the waters, and the lotus-leaf is the waters; and yonder sky is above this earth.
4	1	10	He touches both of them--he thereby brings about concord between them--with , 'A shelter ye are, a shield ye are!'--for both a shelter and a shield these two indeed are;--'uninjured both, and ample,'--for uninjured and ample both these indeed are;--'capacious, guard ye,'--that is, 'spacious, guard ye!'--'bear ye Agni Purîshya!'--that is, 'bear ye Agni, favourable to cattle !'
4	1	11	'Guard ye, light-finders, uniting with each other, with the breast, with the self,'--that is, 'guard him, ye light-finders, uniting with each other, both with your breast and your self;'--'bearing within the brilliant, theeverlasting;'--this Agni indeed is yonder sun, and he is the brilliant, the everlasting one; and him these two bear between (them): hence he says, the brilliant, the everlasting.'
4	1	12	He touches them with two (verses);--two-footed is the Sacrificer, and the Sacrificer is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus brings about concord between these two. And, again, (he does so) because that form of theirs is twofold, (there being) a black antelope skin and a lotus-leaf.
4	2	1	He then touches the lump of clay, with , 'Thou art the Purîshya ,'--that is, 'Thou art favourable to cattle; all-supporting,'--for he (Agni) indeed supports everything here;--'Atharvan was the first that kindled thee, O Agni!'--Atharvan doubtless is the breath, and the breath indeed churned him out (produced him) at first: 'Thou art that Agni who was produced at first,' this he means to say; and that same (Agni) he thus makes it (the lump) to be.
4	2	2	He then takes hold of it with the (right) hand and spade on the right side; and with the (left) hand on the left side, with, 'From the lotus Atharvan churned thee forth,'--the lotus doubtless means the waters, and Atharvan is the breath; and the breath indeed churned him (Agni, the fire) out of the waters at first;--'from the head of every offerer ,'--that is, 'from the head of this All (universe).'
4	2	3	'Also the sage Dadhyañk, the son of Atharvan, kindled thee;'--Dadhyañk, the Âtharvana, doubtless is speech; and he did kindle him therefrom;--'as the Vritra-slayer, the breaker of strongholds,'--Vritra is evil, thus: 'as the slayer of evil, the breaker of strongholds.'
4	2	4	'Also Pâthya, the bull, kindled thee, as the greatest slayer of enemies,'--Pâthya, the bull, doubtless is the Mind, and he did kindle him therefrom;--'as a winner of wealth in every battle,'--as the text, so its meaning.
4	2	5	With Gâyatrî verses (he performs),--the Gâyatrî is the vital air: he thus lays vital air into him. With three (verses);--there are three vital airs, the out-breathing, the in-breathing, and the through-breathing: these he thus lays into him. These (verses) consist of nine feet, for there are nine vital airs, seven in the head, and two downward ones: these he thus lays into him.
4	2	6	And these two following ones are Trishtubhs,--. Now, the Trishtubh is the body (self): it is his (Agni's) body he makes up by means of these two (verses). 'Seat thee, O Hotri, in thine own place, thou, the mindful,'--the Hotri, doubtless, is Agni; and this, the black antelope skin, is indeed his own place; 'the mindful,' that is, 'the wise one;'--'establish the sacrifice in the seat of the good work!'--the seat of the good work doubtless is the black antelope skin;--'god-gladdening, thou shalt worship the gods with offering!'--that is, 'being a god, gratifying the gods, thou shalt worship (them) with offering;'--'Bestow, O Agni, great vigour upon the Sacrificer!'--thereby he implores a blessing upon the Sacrificer.
4	2	7	'The Hotri, in the Hotri's seat, the knowing,'--the Hotri, doubtless, is Agni; the Hotri's seat is the black antelope skin; and the knowing  means the wise one;--'the impetuous and glowing one, of great power, hath sat down,'--that is, the impetuous and shining one, of great power, has sat down;--'the guardian of undisturbed rites, the most wealthy,'--for he indeed is the guardian of undisturbed rites, and the most wealthy;--'the bearer of thousands, the brilliant-tongued Agni,'--a thousand means all, thus, 'the all-bearer, the brilliant-tongued Agni.' With two Trishtubh (verses) relating to Agni (he performs): the meaning of this has been told.
4	2	8	Then there is this last Brihatî verse, for this (fire-altar) when completely built up becomes like the Brihatî (the great) metre: whatlike seed is infused into the womb, suchlike is (the child) born; and because he now makes this verse a Brihatî,therefore this (altar) when completely built up becomes like the Brihatî.
4	2	9	'Seat thee, thou art great,'--he now causes the infused seed to establish itself, whence the seed infused into the womb establishes itself;--'burn thou, best gladdener of the gods!'--that is, 'shine thou, best gladdener of the gods; send forth, O Agni, worthy partaker of the offering, thy showy, ruddy smoke!' for when he (Agni) is kindled, he sends forth his ruddy smoke,--the showy, for it, as it were, shows itself.
4	2	10	These (verses) amount to six,--six seasons are a year, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become. And what comes to be like the year, comes to be like the Brihatî; for the year is the Brihatî,--twelve full moons, twelve eighth days  (of the fortnight of waning moon), twelve new moons, that makes thirty-six, and the Brihatî consists of thirty-six syllables. He takes it (the lump of clay) from the right (south) to the left (north) side (of the hole), for from the right side seed is infused into the womb; and this (hole) now is his (Agni's) womb. He takes it thither without stopping, so as not to stop the seed.
4	3	1	He then pours water into it (the hole), for whatever is injured or torn in this earth that is healed by water: by means of the water he thus joins together and heals what is injured and torn in her.
4	3	2	'Let flow the divine waters, the honey-sweet, for health, for progeny!'--honey means sap (essence): thus, 'the sapful, for health, for progeny;'--'from their seed let plants spring forth, full-berried!' for full-berried plants indeed spring forth from the seat of the waters.
4	3	3	He then heals her with air ; for whatever is injured and torn in this earth that is healed by the air: by means of air he thus joins together and heals what is injured and torn in her.
4	3	4	'May Vâyu Mâtarisvan heal,'--Vâyu Mâtarisvan, doubtless, is he (the wind) that blows yonder;--'the broken heart of thee stretched out with upward look!' for this (hole) is the broken heart of this earth stretched out with upward look;--'thou who goest along by the breath of the gods,'--for he (the wind) indeed goes along by means of the breath of all the gods;--'to thee, Ka, be vashat (success), O god!'--Ka ('Who?') doubtless is Pragâpati, for him he makes this earth to be the Vashat, for there is so far no other oblation than that.
4	3	5	He then heals her by means of the quarters, for whatever is injured and torn in this earth, that is healed by the quarters: by means of the quarters he thus draws and joins together what is injured and torn in her. He joins together this and this quarter , whence these two quarters are joinedtogether; then this one and this one, whence these two also are joined together: first thus, then thus; then thus, then thus. This is moving (from left) to right, for so (it goes) to the gods: with this and this one a means of healing is prepared; with this and this one he heals.
4	3	6	He then takes up together the black antelope skin and the lotus-leaf; for the lotus-leaf is the womb, and with the womb he takes up that infused seed: whence the infused seed is taken up by the womb.  'Wellborn with splendour, the refuge and shelter, hath he settled down in the light;' for well-born he is, and he settles down in the refuge, and shelter, and light.
4	3	7	He then ties it (the lump) up: he thereby keeps the seed within the womb; whence the seed kept within the womb does not escape. With a string (he ties it), for with the string they yoke the draught beast;--with a triple one of reed grass: the significance of this has been told .
4	3	8	He lays it round (the skin), with, 'Invest thyself, O lustrous Agni, in the many-coloured garment!' In the sacrifice the cord is Varunic; having thereby made it non-Varunic, he makes him put on (the skin) as one would make a garment be put on.
4	3	9	He then takes it and rises;--that Agni being yonder sun, he thus causes yonder sun to rise;--with  , 'Rise, thou of good rites,'--the sacrifice doubtless is a rite: thus, 'rise thou, wellworthy of sacrifice;'--'Guard us with godly wisdom!'--that is, 'whatever divine wisdom is thine, therewith guard us!'--'Most brilliant to see with great light,'--that is, 'in order to be seen most brilliant with great light;'--'hither, O Agni, come thou with praises!'--the praises  are the steeds: thus, 'hither, O Agni, come with the steeds.'
4	3	10	He then lifts it upwards from there towards the east; for this Agni is yonder sun: he thus places yonder sun upwards from here in the east, and hence yonder sun is placed upwards from here in the east.  'Upright for our protection, stand thou like the god Savitri!'--as the text, so its meaning;--'upright, as a bestower  of strength,'--for standing upright he (the sun) indeed bestows  strength, food;--'when we utter our call with the shining offerers'--the shining offerers , doubtless, are his (the sun's) rays: it is these he means. He lifts it up beyond the reach of his arms, for beyond the reach of his arms is that (sun) from here. He then lowers it; and having lowered it, he holds it above the navel: the meaning of this (will be explained) hereafter .
4	4	1	That (lump of clay representing Agni) is still in his hand when he addresses the animals; for the gods, being about to equip  (Agni), now first laid vigour into them; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer, or priest) now, being about to equip (Agni), first lay vigour into these (cattle).
4	4	2	He addresses the horse, with , 'Thus born, art thou the child of the two worlds;'--the two worlds, doubtless, are these two, heaven and earth; and he (Agni) thus born, is the child of these two;--'O Agni, the lovely (child), distributed among the plants,'--for he, the lovely one, is indeed distributed among all the plants ;--'a brilliant child, through gloom and night,'--for as a brilliant child, he (Agni) indeed shines beyond gloom and night;--'crying aloud thou didst go forth from the mothers;'--his mothers, doubtless, are the plants, and from them he comes forth crying aloud. He thereby lays vigour into the horse.
4	4	3	Then (he addresses) the ass, with , 'Steadfast be thou, firm-limbed, and a swift racer be thou, O steed!'--that is, 'be thou steadfast, and firm-limbed, and swift, and a racer, O steed!'--'Ample be thou, and well to sit upon, thou, the bearer of Agni's supply!'--that is, 'bethou ample (broad), well to rest upon, thou, Agni's provender-bearer !' He thereby lays vigour into the ass.
4	4	4	Then the he-goat, with , 'Be thou propitious unto human creatures, O Aṅgiras!'--for Agni is Aṅgiras, and the he-goat is sacred to Agni: he thus appeases him with a view to his doing no injury;--'Scorch not heaven and earth, nor the air, nor the trees!'--that is, 'do not injure anything!' He thereby lays vigour into the he-goat.
4	4	5	With three (verses) he addresses (the animals), for threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus lays vigour into them.
4	4	6	He then holds it (Agni, the lump of clay) over these animals, whereby he equips him (Agni) with these cattle. He does not touch them, lest he should injure that seed by the thunderbolt, for cattle are a thunderbolt, and this (clay) is seed; or lest that Agni should injure those cattle, for that (lump of clay) is Agni, and these (animals) are cattle.
4	4	7	In the first place he holds it over the horse, with , 'Let the racer start forth neighing lustily,'--that is, 'Let the racer start forth neighing repeatedly;'--'the running ass, crying aloud!' He thus mentions the ass in the formula of the horse, and thereby imbues the ass with sorrow ;--'bearing Agni Purîshya, may henot perish before his full measure of time!'--that is, 'bearing Agni favourable to cattle, may he (the horse) not perish before (the completion of) this sacred work.' He thereby equips him (Agni) with the horse.
4	4	8	Then (over) the ass, with, 'The male carrying Agni, the male,'--for Agni is a male, and the he-ass is a male: that male carries the male;--'the sea-born child of the waters,'--for he (Agni) is the sea-born child of the waters. He thereby equips him with the ass.
4	4	9	He then takes it off, with, 'O Agni, come hither to the feast!'--that is, 'in order to rejoice.' By means of the brahman, the yagus (formula), he thus removes him (Agni) from the Sûdra caste.
4	4	10	Then (he holds it over) the he-goat, with , 'The law--the truth, the law--the truth!--the (divine) law doubtless is this Agni; and the truth is yonder sun; or, rather, the law is yonder (sun), and the truth is this (Agni); but, indeed, this Agni is both the one and the other: hence he says, 'the law--the truth, the law--the truth.' He thereby equips him with the he-goat
4	4	11	With three (beasts) he equips (Agni),--three fold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus equips him. With three (verses) he previously addresses (the beasts),--that mikes six: the significance of this (number) has been explained.
4	4	12	They then make the beasts return (to the Âhavanîya): the he-goat goes first of them, then the ass, then the horse. Now, in going away from this (Âhavanîya ), the horse goes first, then the ass, then the he-goat,--for the horse corresponds to the Kshatra (nobility), the ass to the Vaisya and Sûdra, the he-goat to the Brâhmana.
4	4	13	And inasmuch as, in going from here, the horse goes first, therefore the Kshatriya, going first, is followed by the three other castes; and inasmuch as, in returning from there, the he-goat goes first, therefore the Brâhmana, going first, is followed by the three other castes. And inasmuch as the ass does not go first, either in going from here, or in coming back from there, therefore the Brâhmana and Kshatriya never go behind the Vaisya and Sûdra hence they walk thus in order to avoid a confusion between good and bad. And, moreover, he thus encloses those two castes (the Vaisya and Sûdra) on both sides by the priesthood and the nobility, and makes them submissive.
4	4	14	He then looks at the sham-man, with, 'Agni Purîshya we bear, Aṅgiras-like;'--that is, 'Agni, favourable to cattle, we bear, like Agni.' He thereby equips him with the sham-man.
4	4	15	He (the Adhvaryu) arrives (near the fire) while holding (the lump of clay) over the he-goat; for the he-goat is sacred to Agni: he thus equips him (Agni) with his own self, with his own godhead. And, moreover, the he-goat is the Brahman (priesthood): with the Brahman he thus equips him.
4	4	16	He then takes it down, with, 'O plants, welcome ye with joy this propitious Agni coming hitherwards!' for the plants are afraid lest he (Agni) should injure them: it is for them that henow appeases him, saying, 'Welcome ye him with joy, propitious he comes to you; he will not injure you!'--'Removing all infirmities, afflictions; settling down, drive off from us evil intention!' that is, 'removing all infirmities and afflictions, settling down, drive off from us all evil!'
4	4	17	'O plants, receive him joyfully, ye blossoming, full-berried ones!' for that is their perfect form when they are blossoming and full-berried: thus, 'Being perfect, receive ye him joyfully!'--'this timely child of yours hath settled down in his old seat;' that is, 'this seasonable child of yours has settled down in his eternal seat.'
4	4	18	With two (verses) he takes it down,--two-footed is the Sacrificer, and the Sacrificer is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus takes it down. He takes it down from the right (south) to the left (north) side: the significance of this has been explained. Raised and sprinkled is (the place) where he takes it down, for on a (mound), raised and sprinkled, the (sacrificial) fire is laid down. Gravel is strewed thereon: the significance of this (will be explained) hereafter .
4	4	19	It is enclosed on all sides ; for at that time the gods were afraid, thinking, 'We hope the Rakshas, the fiends, will not smite here this (Agni) of ours!' They enclosed him with this stronghold; and in like manner does this one now enclose him with this stronghold. And, again, this is a womb;and this (clay) is seed; and in secret, as it were, the seed is infused into the womb: it is thus made of the form of the womb; and hence it is only in secret that one would have intercourse even with his own wife.
4	4	20	He then unties it (the lump of clay): whatever part of his (body) pains him (Agni) when tied up, that pain he now puts outside of him; and, moreover, he causes him to be born from that womb (the antelope skin).
4	4	21	'Blazing forth with wide glare,'--that is, 'Shining brightly with wide glare;'--'chase away the terrors of the hating demons!'--that is, 'chase away all evils!'--'May I be in the protection of the great, the good protector, in the guidance of Agni, ready to our call!' thereby he invokes a blessing.
4	4	22	He then cuts off some goat's hair, and lets loose the animals towards the north-east; for this, the north-east, is the region of both gods and men: he thus bestows cattle on that region, and hence both gods and men subsist on cattle.
5	1	1	That water (used for working the clay) has been boiled by means of resin of the palâsa tree (butea frondosa), just for the sake of firmness. And as to why (it is done) by palâsa resin;--the palâsa tree doubtless is Soma , and Soma is the moon, and that (moon) indeed is one of Agni'sforms: it is for the obtainment of that form of Agni (that palâsa resin is used).
5	1	2	He pours it on (the clay), with , 'Refreshing ye are, O waters !' To whatever deity a Rik-verse, and to whatever deity a Yagus formula applies, that Rik-verse is that very deity, and that Yagus formula is that very deity: hence this triplet  is these waters, and they are those very waters which appeared as one form : that form he now makes it.
5	1	3	He then produces foam and puts it thereto: the second form which was created (in the shape of) foam , that form he thus makes it. And the clay he now mixes is that very clay which was created as the third form. It was from these forms that he (Agni) was created at the beginning, and from them he now produces him.
5	1	4	He then mixes it with the goat's hair, just for the sake of firmness. And as to why with goat's hair,--the gods then collected him (Agni) from out of the cattle, and in like manner does this one now collect him from out of the cattle. And as to why with goat's hair, it is because in the he-goat (is contained) the form of all cattle; and as to its being hair, form is hair .
5	1	5	'Mitra having mixed the earth and ground with light,'--Mitra doubtlessis the breath, and the breath first did this sacred work;--'I mix (fashion) thee, the well-born knower of beings, for health to creatures,'--as the text, so its meaning.
5	1	6	Then there are these three kinds of powder (dust)--(sand of) gravel, stone, and iron-rust--therewith he mixes (the clay), just for firmness. And as to why (it is mixed) therewith, it is because thereof this (earth) consisted when it was created in the beginning: thus whatlike this (earth) was created in the beginning, such he now makes it (the earth, or fire-pan).
5	1	7	'The Rudras, having mixed the earth, kindled the great light;'--for this Agni is yonder sun: thus it is that great light which the Rudras, having mixed the earth, did kindle;--'yea, never-failing and brilliant, their light shineth among the gods;'--for that never-failing and brilliant light of theirs does indeed shine among the gods.
5	1	8	With two (verses) he mixes (the clay),--two-footed is the Sacrificer, and the Sacrificer is Agni as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great he thus mixes (fashions) him.
5	1	9	He then kneads it, with, 'Mixed by the Vasus, the Rudras,'--for this (clay) has indeed been mixed both by the Vasus and the Rudras: by the Vasus, because by Mitra and by the Rudras, because by the Rudras;--'by the wise, the clay suitable for the work;'--for wise those (gods) are, and suitable for the (sacred) work is this clay;--'making it soft with her hands, may Sinîvalî fashion it!'--Sinîvalî doubtless is speech: thus, 'May she, having made it soft with her hands, fashion it!'
5	1	10	'Sinîvalî, the fair-knotted, fair-braided, fair-locked,'--for Sinîvalî is a woman, and that is indeed the perfect form of woman, to wit, the fair-knotted, fair-braided, fair-locked: he thus makes her perfect;--'may she place the fire-pan into thy hands, O great Aditi!'--the great Aditi doubtless is this earth: it is to this earth that he says this.
5	1	11	'Let Aditi fashion the fire-pan, by her skill, her arms, her wisdom!'--for by her skill, by her arms, and by her wisdom she does indeed fashion it;--'may she bear Agni in her womb, even as a mother (bears) her son in her lap!'--that is, 'as a mother would bear her son in her lap, so may she (Aditi) bear Agni in her womb!'
5	1	12	With three (formulas) he kneads (the clay),--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus kneads him. With two (verses) he mixes,--that makes five;--of five layers consists the fire-altar (Agni); five seasons are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become. With three (formulas) he pours water thereto,--that makes eight;--of eight syllables the Gâyatrî metre consists, and Agni is Gâyatra: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become. And, moreover, as one of eight syllables  this (earth) was created in the beginning: thus as great as this (earth) was created in the beginning, so great he thus makes this (fire-pan representing the earth).
5	2	1	He then takes a lump of clay, as much as he thinks sufficient for the bottom part, with, 'Makha's head thou art!'--Makha, doubtless, is the sacrifice, and this is its head; for the Âhavanîya fire is the head of the sacrifice, and that Âhavanîya (fire-altar) he is now about to build: hence he says, 'Makha's head thou art!'
5	2	2	And, again, as to why he says, 'Makha's head thou art!'--when he (Agni) is built up, then he is born, and it is by the head (issuing first), by the top, that he who is born is born: 'when he is born, may he be born by the head, by the top!' so he thinks.
5	2	3	He spreads it out, with , 'May the Vasus, Aṅgiras-like, fashion thee by the Gâyatrî metre!'--for the bottom part is this (terrestrial) world, and this the Vasus fashioned by means of the Gâyatrî metre; and in like manner does this one now fashion it by means of the Gâyatrî metre;--'Aṅgiras-like,' he says, for Aṅgiras is the breath. 'Thou art steadfast!'--that is, 'thou art firm,' or, 'thou art fixed;'--'Thou art the earth!'--for this bottom part is indeed the earth;--'Establish in me offspring, increase of wealth, lordship of cattle, manhood, clansmen for the Sacrificer!' For the Vasus, having fashioned this (terrestrial) world, invoked this blessing thereon; and in like manner does the Sacrificer, having fashioned this world, now invoke this blessing thereon. Having made it of the measure of a span (in each direction), he then turns up its edge on each side.
5	2	4	He then lays thereon the first (lower) side-part,with, 'May the Rudras, Aṅgiras-like, fashion thee by the Trishtubh metre!'--for this side-part is the air, and this the Rudras fashioned by means of the Trishtubh metre; and in like manner does this one now fashion it by means of the Trishtubh metre;--'Aṅgiras-like,' he says, for Aṅgiras is the breath;--'Thou art steadfast!'--that is, 'thou art firm,' or 'thou art fixed;'--'Thou art the air!' for this side-part is indeed the air;--'Establish in me offspring, increase of wealth, lordship of cattle, manhood, clansmen for the Sacrificer!' For the Rudras, having fashioned the air, invoked this blessing thereon; and in like manner does this Sacrificer, having fashioned the air, now invoke this blessing thereon. Having stroked and smoothed it all over--
5	2	5	He lays on the upper side-part, with, 'May the Âdityas, Aṅgiras-like, fashion thee by the Gagatî metre!' for this side-part is yonder sky, and this the Âdityas fashioned by means of the Gagatî metre; and in like manner does this one now fashion it by means of the Gagatî metre;--'Aṅgiras-like,' he says, for Aṅgiras is the breath;--'Thou art steadfast!'--that is, 'thou art firm,' or 'thou art fixed;'--'Thou art the sky!' for that side-part is indeed the sky;--'Establish in me offspring, increase of wealth, lordship of cattle, manhood, clansmen for the Sacrificer!' For the Âdityas, having fashioned the sky, invoked this blessing thereon; and in like manner the Sacrificer, having fashioned the sky, now invokes this blessing thereon.
5	2	6	He then makes it (complete), with this fourth prayer, 'May the All-gods, the friends of allmen, fashion thee, Aṅgiras-like, by the Anushtubh metre!'--this prayer, doubtless, is the (four) quarters, and the All-gods, the friends of all men, did then, by means of this prayer, put the quarters into these worlds, (that is) into the fire-pan; and in like manner does the Sacrificer, by means of this prayer, now put the quarters into these worlds, into the fire-pan;--'Aṅgiras-like,' he says, because Aṅgiras is the breath;--'Thou art steadfast!'--that is, 'thou art firm,' or 'thou art fixed;'--'Thou art the quarters!' for this prayer indeed is the quarters;--'Establish in me offspring, increase of wealth, lordship of cattle, manhood, clansmen for the Sacrificer!' For the All-gods, the friends of all men, having fashioned the quarters, invoked this blessing on them; and in like manner the Sacrificer, having fashioned the quarters, now invokes this blessing on them.
5	2	7	With that same formula he fashions it both inside and outside, whence the quarters are both inside and outside these worlds. He therewith fashions it without restriction (to any part of the pan), for unrestricted are the quarters.
5	2	8	He makes it just a span high, and a span sideways; for Vishnu, when an embryo, was a span long, and this (fire-pan) is the womb: he thus makes the womb of equal size with the embryo .
5	2	9	Were it larger than a span, he would make it smaller by that prayer; and were it smaller, (he would make it) larger thereby .
5	2	10	If there be one victim, let him make it (the pan) one span wide; and if there be five victims, let him make it five spans wide, or an arrow's width; for the arrow means strength: he thus makes it to be composed of strength. But, indeed, an arrow formerly used to be five spans long .
5	2	11	He then lays round the horizontal belt (or rim);--that is the quarters; for the gods, having made these worlds, the fire-pan, strengthened and encircled them by the quarters; and in like manner the Sacrificer, having made these worlds, the fire-pan, thus strengthens and encircles them by the quarters.
5	2	12	He lays this (rim) on the upper third (of the side), for it is there the ends of these worlds meet, and he thus makes them firm thereby.
5	2	13	'Thou art Aditi's girdle!'--in the sacrifice the string relates to Varuna: he thus lays this belt round after (expressly) making it one not relating to Varuna.
5	2	14	He then silently makes four upright (bands), for these are the quarters;--for the gods, having made these worlds, the fire-pan, made them firm on all sides by means of the quarters ; and in like manner the Sacrificer, having made these worlds, the fire-pan, now makes them firm on all sides by means of the quarters.
5	2	15	These (vertical bands) run up to (the rim of) it, for they did then support it, and so do they now support it: thus that upper part of it becomes firmby means of the horizontal belt, and that lower part of it by means of these (vertical bands).
5	2	16	At their tops they form nipples; for the gods, having made these worlds, the fire-pan, drew forth for themselves from these nipples all (objects of) their desires; and in like manner the Sacrificer, having made these worlds, the fire-pan, draws forth from these nipples all his desires.
5	2	17	This (fire-pan) indeed is a cow, for the fire-pan is these worlds, and these worlds are a cow: that horizontal belt is its udder; it is in the (upper) third of it, for the udder is in one-third of the cow.
5	2	18	He forms nipples to it, whereby he forms the nipples of the udder: it has four nipples, for the cow has four nipples.
5	2	19	Some, indeed, make it with two nipples, or also with eight nipples; but let him not do so, for those cattle which have fewer nipples than a cow, and those which have more nipples, are less fit to yield him a livelihood: hence they make this (fire-pan) less fit to yield a livelihood; and, indeed, they do not make it (like) a cow, but (like) a bitch, or a ewe, or a mare; hence let him not do so.
5	2	20	He then takes hold of its bowl, with, 'May Aditi seize thy bowl!' Aditi, doubtless, is Speech; and the gods, having then fashioned it, perfected it by means of Aditi, speech; and in like manner this one, having fashioned it, now perfects it by means of Aditi, speech.
5	2	21	Having grasped it with both hands, he sets it down, with, 'She, having fashioned the great (mahîm) fire-pan,'--that is, 'she, having fashioned the great (mahatîm) fire-pan;'--'the earthen womb for Agni;'--for this is indeed Agni'searthen womb;--'Aditi offered it unto her sons, thinking, They shall bake it!'--for Aditi, indeed, having fashioned it, offered it to the gods, her sons, to bake it; and in like manner does this one now, after fashioning it, offer it to the gods to bake it.
5	2	22	Now some make three (fire-pans), saying, 'Three (in number) are these worlds, and the fire-pans are these worlds;' and also for mutual expiation, thinking, 'If the one will break, we shall carry (Agni) in the other, and if the other (breaks), then in the other (or third).' Let him not do so; for that first bottom part is this world; and that first (lower) side-part is the air; and the upper one is the sky; and that fourth, the prayer, doubtless is the quarters; and just as much as these worlds and the quarters are, so much is this whole (universe). But were he to add anything thereto, he would make it to be redundant, and whatever redundant (act) is done in the sacrifice is left over for the Sacrificer's spiteful rival. And as to the expiation in case of the (fire-pan being) broken, that (will be told) in a subsequent chapter .
5	3	1	Of that same (clay) she (the queen) forms the first, the 'invincible' (brick); for the invincible one (Ashâdhâ) is this earth, and this earth was created first of these worlds. She forms it of that same clay, for this earth is (one) of these worlds. The (Sacrificer's) consecrated consort (mahishî) forms it: for this earth is a 'mahishî' (female buffalo, a cow). She who is first taken to wife is the consecrated consort.
5	3	2	It measures a foot (in length and breadth), for the foot is a foundation, and this earth also is a foundation. It is marked with three lines, for this earth is threefold .
5	3	3	Now he (the Sacrificer) makes the fire-pan: he thereby makes these worlds. He then makes the (three) 'all-light' (bricks), that is these deities, Agni, Vâyu, Âditya, for those deities indeed are all the light. He makes them from that same clay (as the fire-pan): he thus produces these gods from these worlds. The Sacrificer makes them. They are marked with three lines, for threefold are these gods . Thus as regards the deities.
5	3	4	Now as regards the self (or body): the fire-pan, indeed, is the self (of Agni). The 'invincible' (brick) is speech: that she (the wife) makes first, for this speech is foremost in the body. She makes it from that same clay, for this speech is of the body. The (Sacrificer's) consecrated consort makes it, for speech is a 'mahishî.' It is marked with three lines, for speech is divided into three kinds, Rik-verses, Yagus-formulas, and Sâman-tunes; and because of this threefold form of speech, low-voiced, half-loud, and loud.
5	3	5	He makes the fire-pan: thereby he makes (Agni's) self. He then makes the 'all-light' (bricks),--the 'all-light' (brick) is offspring, for offspring indeed is all the light: he thus causes generation to take place. He makes them of the same clay (as the fire-pan): he thus produces offspring from the self. The Sacrificer makes them: the Sacrificer thusproduces offspring from his own self. He makes them without interruption: he thus produces uninterrupted offspring from his own self. He makes them subsequently (to the fire-pan): he thus produces the offspring subsequently to his own self. They are marked with three lines, for generation is threefold, father, mother, and son; or, the embryo, and the inner and outer membrane.
5	3	6	He makes these from (clay) prepared with prayer, the others from (clay) prepared without prayer; for these are defined, the others undefined; these are limited (in number), the others unlimited.
5	3	7	That Agni is Pragâpati; but Pragâpati is both of this, defined and undefined, limited and unlimited: thus when he makes (bricks) from (clay) prepared with prayer, he thereby makes up that form of his (Pragâpati's) which is defined and limited; and when he makes them from (clay) prepared without prayer, he thereby makes up that form of his which is undefined and unlimited. Verily, then, whosoever knowing this does it on this wise, makes up the whole and complete Agni. From the (clay) lying ready prepared, he leaves over a lump for expiations .
5	3	8	He (the Adhvaryu) now fumigates it (the fire-pan)--just for the sake of strength, or to (mark) the progress of the work. And, again, as to why he fumigates,--that fire-pan is the head of the sacrifice, and the smoke its breath: he thus puts breath into the head.
5	3	9	He fumigates it with horse-dung, to insure it against injury; for the horse is sacred to Pragâpati,and Pragâpati is Agni, and one does not injure one's own self. And with dung (he does it) because that is what was eaten (by the horse) and is useless; and thus he does not injure the horse itself, nor the other cattle.
5	3	10	'May the Vasus make thee fragrant by the Gâyatrî measure, Aṅgiras-like!--May the Rudras make thee fragrant by the Trishtubh metre, Aṅgiras-like!--May the Âdityas make thee fragrant by the Gagatî metre, Aṅgiras-like!--May the All-gods, the friends of all men, make thee fragrant by the Anushtubh metre, Aṅgiras-like!--May Indra make thee fragrant!--May Varuna make thee fragrant!--May Vishnu make thee fragrant!'--he thus fumigates it by means of the deities.
5	3	11	Seven balls of horse-dung are (used), and seven formulas: those deities are sevenfold , and seven vital airs there are in the head. But also what is many times, seven times seven, is (expressed by) seven : he thus puts the seven vital airs into the head.
5	4	1	He now digs that (hole)  in the earth; for the gods now were afraid, thinking, 'We hope the Rakshas, the fiends, will not smite here this (Agni) ofours!' They made this (earth) to be his self (body), for protection, thinking, 'The self will protect itself.'
5	4	2	He digs him out with (the help of) Aditi, in order to guard him from injury; for Aditi is this earth, and one does not injure one's own self; but were he to dig with (the help of) another deity, he surely would injure him (Agni).
5	4	3	'May the divine Aditi, clear to all the gods, dig thee, Aṅgiras-like, O hole, in the lap of the earth!'--for this hole (is dug) among the gods. That bamboo spade now disappears. This hole is four-cornered, for there are four quarters: he thus digs it from all the quarters . Having then laid down fuel in it, he silently puts the 'invincible' (brick) thereon, for that is made first.
5	4	4	He then sets down the fire-pan (with the bottom part upwards), with, 'May the divine wives of the gods, dear to all the gods, place thee, Aṅgiras-like, O fire-pan, in the lap of the earth!' for of old the divine wives of the gods, dear to all the gods, indeed, like Aṅgiras, placed that (fire-pan) into the lap of the earth, and by (the help of) them he now places it. But, surely, these are the plants,--the wives of the gods are indeed the plants; for by the plants everything here is supported: by means of the plants he thus supports this (fire-pan). He then lays down silently the all-light' (bricks). Having then placed fuel thereon he kindles it.
5	4	5	'May the divine Dhishanâs, dear to all the gods, kindle thee, Aṅgiras-like, O fire-pan, in the lap of the earth!' for of old the divine Dhishanâs, dear to all the gods, indeed kindled it, like Aṅgiras, in the lap of the earth, and with their help he now kindles it. But, surely, this is Vâk (speech),--the Dhishanâs are indeed speech , for by speech everything is kindled here: by means of speech he thus kindles this (fire-pan). Whilst looking at it, he then mutters these three formulas:
5	4	6	'May the divine protectresses, dear to all the gods, heat thee, O fire-pan, Aṅgiras-like, in the lap of the earth!' for of old the divine protectresses, dear to all the gods, indeed, like Aṅgiras, heated it in the lap of the earth; and by them he now heats it. But, surely, these are the days and nights,--the protectresses are indeed the days and nights; for by days and nights everything is covered here: by means of the days and nights he thus heats it.
5	4	7	'May the divine ladies, dear to all the gods, bake thee, Aṅgiras-like, O fire-pan, in the lap of the earth!' for of old the divine ladies, dear to all the gods, did, like Aṅgiras, bake it in the lap of the earth, and with their help he now bakes it. But, surely, these are the metres,--the ladies (gnâ) are indeed the metres (scripture texts), for by means of these men go (gam) to the celestial world: by means of the metres he thus bakes it.
5	4	8	'May the divine women, with unclipped wings, dear to all the gods, bake thee, Aṅgiras-like, O fire-pan, in the lap of the earth!' forof old the divine women, with unclipped wings, dear to all the gods, did bake it, like Aṅgiras, in the lap of the earth; and with their help he now bakes it. But, surely, these are the stars,--the women (gani) are indeed the stars, for these are the lights of those righteous men (gana) who go to the celestial world: it is by means of the stars that he thus bakes it.
5	4	9	Now he digs with one (formula), he sets down (the fire-pan) with one, he kindles with one, he heats with one, he bakes (pak) with two, whence twice in the year food is ripened (pak); these amount to six,--six seasons are a year, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.
5	4	10	And as often as he attends to (the fire by adding fresh fuel)  he attends to it with the prayer relating to Mitra, ' of Mitra, the preserver of men  . . .;' for a friend (mitra) does not injure any one, nor does any one injure his friend; and in like manner does this one not injure that (fire-pan), nor does it (injure) him. By day he should put (fuel) on it, by day he should clear it (of the ashes).
5	4	11	He clears it (of the ashes) with a prayer relating to Savitri,--for Savitri is the impeller: impelledby Savitri, he thus clears it-- 'May the divine Savitri, the well-handed, well-fingered, and well-armed, clear thee by his might!'--for Savitri is all that.
5	4	12	He then turns it (the fire-pan) round, with. 'Not tottering upon the earth, fill the regions, the quarters!'--that is, 'not tottering, fill thou with sap the regions and quarters on earth!'
5	4	13	He then takes it up, with  'May the Vasus fill thee with the Gâyatrî metre, Aṅgiras-like!--May the Rudras fill thee with the Trishtubh metre, Aṅgiras-like!--May the Âdityas fill thee with the Gagatî metre, Aṅgiras-like!--May the All-gods, dear to all men, fill thee with the Anushtubh metre, Aṅgiras-like!'--by these deities he thus moistens it: by whatever deities he fashions it, by them he fumigates it, and by them he moistens it. For he who performs a work, knows the practice of it: hence by whatever deities he fashions it, by them he fumigates and moistens it.
6	1	1	Many  are the oblations, in the building of the fire-altar, as well as at any other (special ceremony) than the building of the fire-altar. For there are supernumerary rites,--supernumerary are those which are (performed) over and above another rite: of these  are the building of the altar (Agnikityâ), the Râgasûya, the Vâgapeya, and the Asvamedha; and because they are over and above the other (normal) rites, therefore they are supernumerary.
6	1	2	A cake  on eleven potsherds to Agni and Vishnu,--that is the initiation (offering) of the (Soma) sacrifice;--one on twelve potsherds to Vaisvânara, and a pap to the Âdityas,--these two belong to Agni.
6	1	3	Now were he to prepare only the one for Agni and Vishnu, and not the other two oblations, then only the initiation (offering) of the (Soma) sacrifice would be performed, and not those of Agni (the fire-altar); and were he to prepare only the other two oblations, and not the one to Agni and Vishnu, only the initiation (offering) of Agni would be performed, and not that of the sacrifice.
6	1	4	He prepares both that of the sacrifice, and those of Agni, for this rite is both a rite of sacrifice, and a rite of fire: first (comes) that of the sacrifice, and then that of the fire, for the rite of the fire is an accessory rite.
6	1	5	Now as regards that (cake) for Agni and Vishnu, its mystic import is the same as what is (implied) in a preparatory ceremony. And the (cake) on twelve potsherds for Vaisvânara is forthe obtainment of all the fires, Vaisvânara being all the fires;--it is one of twelve potsherds, for twelve months are a year, and Vaisvânara is the year.
6	1	6	And, again, as to why he prepares one for Vaisvânara,--it is because he is about to produce Agni as Vaisvânara (belonging, or dear to, all men): in the initiation offering he first pours him forth as seed, and whatlike the seed is that is poured into the womb, suchlike is (the child) born therefrom; and inasmuch as he now pours forth that (Agni) Vaisvânara as seed, therefore he is born hereafter as Vaisvânara.
6	1	7	And why he prepares those two (other) oblations,--Vaisvânara is the ruling power, and that Âditya pap is the people: he thus makes both the ruling power and the people. The Vaisvânara (cake) he prepares first, and having thereby made the ruling power, he makes the people.
6	1	8	That (Vaisvânara cake) is one single (oblation), having one single deity: he thus makes the ruling power to be concentrated in one (person), and excellence to be concentrated in one. The other, the pap, has many deities, for the pap is a multiplicity of rite-grains, and those Âdityas are a multiplicity of gods: he thus bestows multiplicity on the people. Thus much as to the deities.
6	1	9	Now as regards the self (or body of Agni). The Vaisvânara (cake) is the head, and that Âditya pap is the body: he thus makes both the head and the body. The Vaisvânara (cake) he prepares first; and having thereby made the head, he then makes the body.
6	1	10	That (Vaisvânara cake) is one single (oblation), for the head is, as it were, one only; and theother, the pap, has many deities, for that pap is a multiplicity of rice-grains, and this body is a multiplicity of limbs: he thus bestows on the body a multiplicity of limbs.
6	1	11	That (pap) is (prepared) on ghee, for the Âdityas are consumers of ghee: he thus gratifies them, each by his own share, by his own liquor. These offerings are (made) silently, for here in the sacrifice there is seed, and silently seed is infused.
6	1	12	He then offers the Audgrabhana (libations) , for by the Audgrabhanas (elevatory libations) the gods raised themselves from this world to the heavenly world: and inasmuch as (thereby) they raised themselves (ud-grabh), they are called 'audgrabhana;'--and in like manner does the Sacrificer, by means of the Audgrabhanas, now raise himself from this world to the heavenly world.
6	1	13	There are many of these, in the building of the fire-altar as well as at any other (special ceremony): the significance of this has been told. They are of both kinds: (the significance) of this has been told;--first those of the sacrifice, and then those of the fire: (the significance) of this also has been told.
6	1	14	He offers five of the sacrifice ,--the sacrifice is fivefold: as great as the sacrifice is, as great as is its measure, by so much he thus pours it forth as seed. Seven (libations) of the fire,--the fire(-altar) consists of seven layers ; seven seasons are a year, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus pours him forth as seed. Those two kinds (of libations) amount to twelve,--twelve months are a year, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.
6	1	15	He offers , with , 'The Purpose, Agni, the Impulse, hail!'--from purpose, indeed, this sacred rite originated at first, and he now impels (yokes, uses) it for this rite.
6	1	16	'Mind, Wisdom, Agni, the Impulse, hail!'--from the mind indeed this sacred rite originated at first, and he now impels it for this rite.
6	1	17	'Thought, knowledge, Agni, the Impulse, hail!'--from thought, indeed, this sacred rite originated at first, and he now impels it for this rite.
6	1	18	'The distinction of Speech, Agni, the Impulse, hail!'--from speech, indeed, this sacred rite originated at first, and he now impels it for this rite.
6	1	19	'To Pragâpati, to Manu, hail!'--Mann, forsooth, is Pragâpati, for he thought out (man) all this (universe); and Pragâpati, indeed, of old performed this rite, and he now makes use of him for this rite.
6	1	20	'To Agni Vaisvânara, hail!'--Agni Vaisvânara, doubtless, is the year; and the year, indeed,of old performed this rite; and he now makes use thereof for this rite.
6	1	21	He then offers the one to Savitri, for Savitri, indeed, of old performed this rite, and he now makes use of him for this rite,--, 'Every mortal would choose the friendship of the divine Guide; every one craves riches, and would have glory for him to prosper, hail!' He who chooses the friendship of the god Savitri, chooses both glory and prosperity; and he who performs this rite, indeed chooses his friendship.
6	1	22	Now some offer these Audgrabhana libations into the fire-pan itself, saying, 'These, surely, are offered for (special) objects of desire, and that fire-pan is the Sacrificer's self: we thus secure for the Sacrificer's self all his objects of desire.' Let him not do so; for the fire which is kindled (in the fire-pan) is the essence of the completed sacrifice and of those libations, and when he puts the fire-pan on the fire, after the sacrifice has been completed and the Audgrabhanas offered, then the sacrifice mounts it (the pan), and it bears the sacrifice: let him, therefore, put the fire-pan on the fire only after the sacrifice is complete, and the Audgrabhanas have been offered.
6	1	23	It is covered with a layer of Muñga grass, just for the purpose that it may blaze up. And as to why it is with a layer of Muñga grass, (it is done) to avoid injury, for that Muñga grass is a womb, and the womb does not injure the child; for he who is born, is born from a womb: 'May he (Agni), when he is born, be born from the womb,' thus he thinks.
6	1	24	Inside  there is a layer of hemp, just for the purpose that it may blaze up. And as to its being a layer of hemp,--the inner membrane (amnion) of the womb from which Pragâpati was born consists of flax, and the outer membrane (chorion) of hemp: hence the latter is foul-smelling, for it is the outer membrane of the embryo.  to avoid injury, for the outer membrane does not injure the embryo; and it is from the outer membrane of the embryo that he who is born is born: 'May he (Agni), when he is born, be born from the outer membrane of the embryo!' thus he thinks.
6	2	1	Standing he puts it (the pan) on the fire, for the fire-pan is these worlds, and these worlds stand, as it were. And, moreover, whilst standing one is strongest.
6	2	2	Standing (with his face) towards north-east, for standing towards north-east Pragâpati created creatures.
6	2	3	And, again, why (he does so) standing towards north-east;--that (quarter), the north-east, is the quarter of both gods and men.
6	2	4	And, again, why standing towards north-east,--in that quarter is the gate of the world of heaven, hence it is standing with his face towards northeast that one offers libations, and standing towards north-east that one leads up the dakshinâs: it is by the gate that he thus makes him enter into the world of heaven.
6	2	5	'Break not! Suffer not injury!'--as the text, so its meaning;--'O mother, bear up bravely!'--for the fire-pan (ukhâ, f.) is a woman; and 'O mother' is a term for addressing a woman: 'bear up well, indeed!'--(Thou) and Agni will do this (work)!'--for (the fire-pan) and Agni will indeed be doing this (sacred work).
6	2	6	'Stand firm, divine Earth, for our well-being!' as the text, so its meaning;--'A divine (âsura) contrivance thou art made in the wonted manner;'--the vital spirit (asu) is the breath, and this (are-pan) has indeed been made its contrivance in the wonted manner;--'May this offering be agreeable to the gods!' he thereby means those libations which he intends to offer in that fire; and moreover, that (fire-pan) itself is an offering;--'unharmed rise thou in this sacrifice!' this he says with the view that it may rise unharmed, uninjured, in this sacrifice.
6	2	7	With two (verses) he heats it on the fire,--the Sacrificer is two-footed, and the Sacrificer is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus heats it (the pan).  with a gâyatrî and a trishtubh verse,--the Gâyatrî is the vital air, and the Trishtubh the body; and the animal is as much as the vital air and the body: thus by as much as the animal (consists of) he puts that (pan) on the fire. And, again, the Gâyatrî is Agni, and the Trishtubh is Indra; and the fire relates to Indra and Agni: as great as the fire is, as great as is its measure, by so much he thus heats it. These two (verses) have seven feet (viz. three and four respectively),--the fire-altar consists of sevenlayers ; seven seasons are a year, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.
6	2	8	When the fire heats it, then the flame mounts up to it; for the fire-pan is a female, and the fire is a male: hence when the male heats the female, he infuses seed into her.
6	2	9	Now, if the flame is too long in mounting up, some throw coals on (the pan), thinking, 'There is fire now on both sides.' But let him not do so; for the animal is indeed born with bones ; but it is not forced in with bones, as it were, at first; but it is introduced only as seed. Now that flame is boneless seed: hence the flame alone should mount up to it.
6	2	10	When the flame mounts up to it, he places a kindling-stick thereon: thereby the seed enters it (the fire-pan), and that fire imparts growth to that seed (in the shape of) this (kindling-stick).
6	2	11	It should be one of krimuka wood. Now, the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pragâpati, strove together. The gods, having placed Agni in front, went up to the Asuras. The Asuras cut off the point of that flame held forward. It settled down on this earth, and became that krimuka tree: hence it is sweet, for there is vital essence (in it). Hence also it is red, for it is a flame, that krimukatree being the same as this Agni: it is (in the shape of) fire that he imparts growth to it.
6	2	12	It (the kindling-stick) is a span long, for Vishnu, as an embryo, was a span long: he thus imparts to it growth equal to his body.
6	2	13	It is soaked in ghee;--the inner membrane of the womb from which Agni was produced consisted of ghee: hence he now blazes up towards it, for it (the stick) is his self (body); and hence it (the krimuka) has no ashes: (Agni) himself now enters into his own self,--to avoid injury , for the inner membrane does not injure the embryo; and it is from the inner membrane that he who is born is born: 'When he (Agni) is born, may he be born from the inner membrane!' thus he thinks.
6	2	14	He puts it (the kindling-stick) on, with , 'The wood-eating, ghee-drinking,'--that is, he who has wood for his food, and ghee for his drink,--'the primeval, desirable Hotri,'--that is, 'the old, desirable Hotri;'--'the wonderful son of power,'--power is strength: thus, 'the wonderful son of strength.' Standing he puts it on with the 'Svâhâ:' the meaning of this (will be explained) hereafter .
6	2	15	Now the fire-pan is the body, the reed-grass (fuel) the womb, the hemp the inner membrane ,the ghee the outer membrane, and the kindling-stick the embryo.
6	2	16	The pan is outside, and the reed-grass (fuel) is inside; for the body is outside, and the womb inside. The reed-grass is outside, and the hemp inside; for the womb is outside, and the outer membrane is inside. The hemp is outside, and the ghee is inside; for the outer membrane is outside, and the inner membrane is inside. The ghee is outside, and the kindling-stick is inside; for the inner membrane is outside, and the embryo is inside. It is from these that he who is born is born, and from them he thus causes him (Agni) to be born.
6	3	1	He then puts on a vikaṅkata (flacourtia sapida) one. When Pragâpati performed the first offering, a vikaṅkata tree sprang forth from that place where, after offering, he cleansed (his hands). That vikaṅkata, then, is that first offering; it is that he now offers on this (fire), and he therewith gratifies him (Agni).  'From the far region come thou over to the near one: do thou protect that wherein I am!' as the text, so its meaning.
6	3	2	He then puts on an udumbara (ficus glomerata) one. The gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pragâpati, strove together. Now all the trees sided with the Asuras, but the udumbara tree alone did not forsake the gods. The gods, having conquered the Asuras, took possession of their trees.
6	3	3	They said, 'Come, let us lay into the udumbara tree whatever pith, whatever vital sap there is in these trees: were they then to desert us, they woulddesert us worn out, like a milked-out cow, or like an ox that has been (tired out by) drawing (the cart).' Accordingly they laid into the udumbara tree what pith and essence there was in those trees; and on account of that pith it matures (fruit) equal to all the (other) trees : hence that (tree) is always moist, always full of milky sap,--that udumbara tree, indeed, (being) all the trees, is all food: he thus gratifies him (Agni) by every kind of food, and kindles him by all trees (kinds of wood).
6	3	4	'From the farthest distance,'--that is, '(from) what farthest distance there is;'--'O red-steeded, come hither!' for red, indeed, is Agni's horse;--'Purîshya, much-loved,'--that is, 'favourable to cattle, dear to many;'--'O Agni, overcome thou the scorners!' that is, 'O Agni, overcome all evil-doers!'
6	3	5	He then puts on one not cut by an axe,--that (Agni) is born when he is built up: it is for all (kinds of) food that he is born. Now that (wood) not cut by an axe is one kind of food (for the fire): it is thereby that he now gratifies him.  'Whatsoever wood we lay upon thee, O Agni, let all that be ghee unto thee, do thou relish that, O youngest!' as the text, so its meaning: whatever (wood there is) not cut by the axe, that he makes palatable to him; and having made it food for him, he sets it before him.
6	3	6	He then puts on one that has lain on the ground,--he (Agni) is born when he is built up: it is for all (kinds of) food that he is born. Now that (wood) which has lain on the ground is one kind of food (for the fire): it is thereby he now gratifies him.  'What the red ant eats, what the white ant crawls over,'--for either the red ant eats it, or the white ant crawls over it;--'let all that be ghee for thee, do thou relish that, O youngest!' as the text, so its meaning: whatever (wood) has lain on the ground, that he makes palatable for him; and having made it food for him, he sets it before him.
6	3	7	The remaining (kindling-sticks) are of palâsa wood (butea frondosa);--the Palâsa tree is the Brahman, it is by the Brahman he thus kindles him (Agni). And, again, why they are palâsa ones--;the Palâsa tree is Soma, and he, Soma, doubtless is the supreme offering: it is that he now offers on this (fire), and by that he gratifies him (Agni).
6	3	8	'Day by day bearing unremittingly,'--that is, 'Day by day bringing not unmindful;'--'food to him like unto a standing horse,'--that is, 'food as to a standing (resting) horse;'--'we, rejoicing in wealth-thrift and sap,'--that is, 'rejoicing in wealth, and thrift, and sap;'--'O Agni, let not us, thy associates, suffer injury!' this he says with a view that his (Agni's) associate (the Sacrificer) may not suffer injury.
6	3	9	'While Agni is kindling on the earth's navel,'--that (place) where he is now being kindled is indeed the navel of the earth;--'we call for great wealth-thrift,'--that is, 'we call for wealth and great thrift;'--'Unto him, the draught-delighted,'--for he is indeed delighted (or, inebriated)by the draught,--'of high praise,'--for he is indeed highly praised;--'the adorable'--that is, 'worthy of adoration;'--'Agni, the conqueror, overpowering in battles;'--for Agni is indeed a conqueror, and overpowering in battles.
6	3	10	'Whatever aggressive armies there are, onrushing with drawn-up lines; whatever thieves and robbers, those I cast into thy mouth, O Agni.'--'Devour thou in a lump the waylayers with thy two tusks, the thieves with thy teeth, and the robbers with thy jaws, O holy one!'--'What waylayers there are among men, what thieves and robbers in the wood, what miscreants in the lurking-places, I throw them into thy jaws.'--'Whatever man may plot against us, and whosoever may hate us, or abuse and seek to hurt us, every one of them burn thou to ashes!'
6	3	11	For the gods then made food of whosoever hated them, and of whomsoever they hated, and gave them up to him (Agni), and thereby gratified him; and this, then, became his food, and he burnt up the evil of the gods: and in like manner does the Sacrificer now make food of whosoever hates him, and of whomsoever he hates, and give them up to him (Agni), and thereby gratify him; and this, then, becomes his food, and he burns up the Sacrificer's evil.
6	3	12	These eleven (kindling-sticks) he puts on for one who is not either a noble, or a domestic chaplain (purohita); for incomplete are those eleven, and incomplete is he who is not either a noble, or a domestic priest.
6	3	13	Twelve (he puts on) for a noble or a domesticchaplain; for those twelve are a complete whole (or everything), and he who is either a noble or a domestic chaplain is everything.
6	3	14	In the case of a Purohita, he puts it on, with , perfected the vigour, the strength, perfected the victorious power (kshatra) whose Purohita I am!'--he thus perfects both his sanctity and power .
6	3	15	And in the case of a nobleman, with ,'I have raised their arms, their lustre and strength: by the spiritual power I destroy the enemies, and elevate mine own (relatives)!' this he says with the view that he may destroy his enemies, and elevate his own relatives. Let him put on both these (kindling-sticks); for both the Brahman and the Kshatra are this Agni; and it is this Agni he thus kindles by those two, by the Brahman and the Kshatra.
6	3	16	These (kindling-sticks) amount to thirteen;--thirteen months are a year, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much food he thus gratifies him.
6	3	17	They are a span long, for Vishnu, as an embryo, was a span long; and this is (Agni's or Vishnu's) food: he thus gratifies him with food proportionate to his own body. But the food which is proportionate to one's body satisfies, and does no injury; but what is too much that does injury, and what is too little that does not satisfy. Standing he puts them on--the significance of this (will be explained)further on;--and with the Svâhâ ('hail!'); for seed is infused here (in the sacrifice,--to wit,) this Agni; and were he to put on the logs unconsecrated by Svâhâ, he would injure him (Agni). Now inasmuch as they are kindling-sticks, they are not oblations; but inasmuch as (they are put on) with the Svâhâ, they are food, for the Svâhâ is food; and thus he does not injure him (Agni).
6	4	1	Having then stridden the Vishnu strides, and reverentially stood by (the fire) with the Vâtsapra  (hymn), after the sun has set, he in the first place throws out the ashes (from the fire-pan). For at that (former) time he regales him (Agni) with that food, those kindling-sticks; and the foul part of that eaten food sinks to the bottom as ashes. He now clears him thereof, and infuses speech into him , thus freed from foulness. Having infused speech, he puts on a kindling-stick,--and thereby regales him with food for the night,--with, 'Night for night bearing unremittingly '--the meaning of this has been told: he prays for that same security and wellbeing for the night; and whatsoever he puts on 'thereafter by night, that he puts on as a libation offered to him .
6	4	2	And in the morning, when the sun has risen, he in the first place throws out the ashes. For at that (former) time he regales him with that food, that kindling-stick; and the foul part of that eaten food which he puts on during the night sinks to thebottom as ashes. He now clears him thereof, and infuses speech into him thus freed from foulness. Having infused speech, he puts on a kindling-stick,--and thereby regales him with food for the day--with, 'Day by day bearing unremittingly;'--the meaning of this has been told: he prays for that same security and well-being for the day; and whatsoever he puts on thereafter by day, that he puts on as a libation offered to him.
6	4	3	Verily, day and night passing on come up to a year, and the year is everything here: he prays for that security and well-being for a succession of days.
6	4	4	And when they give him (the Sacrificer) the fast-milk, he puts on a kindling-stick, after dipping it into the fast-milk. Some, however, say, 'Let him not dip it into the fast-milk: he would be offering a libation, and it would be improper were one who is initiated to offer a libation.'
6	4	5	Let him nevertheless dip it in, for that (Âhavanîya fire) is his (the Sacrificer's) divine body, and this (real body of his) is his human one. Now were he not to dip it in, he would not be satisfying that divine body of his; but when he clips it in, he does so satisfy that divine body. And in that it is a kindling-stick, it is not a libation; and in that it is dipped into the fast-milk, it is food, for the fast-milk is food.
6	4	6	And having put on the kindling-stick, he drinks the fast-milk; for that (fire) is his divine body, and this (body of his) is the human one; and the gods (come) first, and then men: hence he drinks the fast-milk after putting the kindling-stick on (the fire).
6	4	7	'O Lord of food; give us of thy food!'--that is, 'O Lord of viands, give us of thy viands!'--'of the pain-allaying, strengthening'--that is, 'of the hunger-allaying, strengthening (food),'--'Onward, onward lead thou the giver!'--the giver, doubtless, is the Sacrificer: thus, 'Onward lead thou the Sacrificer!'--'Give us sustenance for the two-footed and the four-footed!'--he thereby asks a blessing. Now as to the expiation in case of (the fire-pan being) broken which, he said, would be explained 'in a subsequent chapter .'
6	4	8	If the fire-pan were to break, let him pour that (fire in the pan) into any such unbroken, new pot with a wide mouth as there may be; for the pan which is broken indeed suffers injury, but uninjured is this deity (Agni): 'Uninjured I will bear him in the uninjured!' so he thinks. Into that (pot) he first throws a potsherd of the (broken) pan, and thus he (Agni) is not deprived of that womb of his.
6	4	9	He then takes the (remaining ) clay, and having pounded both the (broken) pan and that remainder, and mixed it, he makes a (new) pan in the very same way, without using any formula, quite silently. Having baked it, he pours (the fire) over. The expiation in this case is one of performance only. Having again thrown that potsherd into the (new) pan, and pounded both the (temporary) pan and the remaining clay, and mixed it, he lays it aside for expiation.
6	4	10	And if the fire in the pan (Ukhya Agni) were to go out, it is doubtless to the Gârhapatya that it goes, for from the Gârhapatya it has been taken. Having then taken it out of the Gârhapatya eastwards (to the place of the Âhavanîya), and put fuel on it, let himput the fire-pan on it in the same way (as before), without using any formula, quite silently. When the fire rises up to it,--
6	4	11	He performs two expiations. For it is for (the obtainment of) all his wishes that he makes up that (fire); and whatever part of his wishes is here cut off when the fire goes out, that he thereby joins together and heals. He performs both expiations, that of the (Soma) sacrifice and that of the fire-altar,--first that of the sacrifice, then that of the fire-altar: the significance of this has been explained .
6	4	12	Having cut out with a kindling-stick some of the butter, he offers sitting a libation, with , 'To Visvakarman, hail!' Then stepping near he puts the kindling-stick on the fire, with , 'Again the Âdityas, the Rudras, the Vasus may kindle thee, again the Brahmans with sacrifices, O bringer of good things!'--that is, 'May those deities again kindle thee!'--'With ghee make thou grow thy body, let the wishes of the Sacrificer be true!'--that is, 'With ghee indeed make thou grow thy body, and for whatever wishes the Sacrificer makes up a fire, may they all come true!'
6	4	13	And if the Gârhapatya fire were to go out, it is doubtless to the churning-sticks that it goes, for from the churning-sticks it has been taken. Having churned it out with the churning-sticks, and put fuel on it, he performs two expiations.
6	4	14	And if the Âhavanîya fire were to go out whilst the pressing (of Soma) proceeds, it is doubtless to the Gârhapatya that it goes, for from the Gârhapatya it has been taken. Having taken it straightwayeastward from the Gârhapatya, and put fuel on it, he performs two expiations: whatever (kind of Soma) sacrifice may be (performed) at the time, the expiation of that sacrifice he should perform; and of like kind is the expiation of the fire-altar.
6	4	15	And if the Âgnîdhrîya fire were to go out, it is doubtless to the Gârhapatya that it goes, for from the Gârhapatya it has been taken. Having taken it from the Gârhapatya eastward along the north of the Sadas, and put fuel on it, he performs two expiations. And if the Gârhapatya were to go out, the meaning (procedure) of that has been explained.
7	1	1	He hangs a gold plate (round his neck), and wears it; for that gold plate is the truth, and the truth is able to sustain that (fire ): by means of the truth the gods carried it, and by means of the truth does he now carry it.
7	1	2	Now that truth is the same as yonder sun. It is a gold (plate), for gold is light, and he (the sun) is the light; gold is immortality, and he is immortality. It (the plate) is round, for he (the sun) is round. It has twenty-one knobs, for he is the twenty-first . He wears it with the knobs outside, for the knobs are his (the sun's) rays, and his rays arc outside.
7	1	3	And as to why he puts on and wears the gold plate;--that plate is yonder sun, and man, in his human form, is unable to sustain that fire: it is only in this (solar or divine) form that he bears that (divine) form.
7	1	4	And, again, why he puts on and wears the gold plate;--this fire is seed poured out here; and the gold plate means vital energy (or brilliance) and vigour: he thus lays vital energy and vigour into that seed.
7	1	5	And, again, why he puts on and wears the gold plate;--the gods now were afraid lest the Rakshas, the fiends, should destroy here that (Agni) of theirs. They made that (plate), yonder sun, to be his (Agni's) protector (standing) by his side, for the gold plate is yonder sun: and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now make that (plate) to be his (Agni's) protector by his side.
7	1	6	It is sown up in a black antelope's skin; for the black antelope skin is the sacrifice, and the sacrifice is able to sustain that (Agni): by means of the sacrifice the gods carried him, and by means of the sacrifice he now carries him;--with the hair (inside), for the hair are the metres, and the metres are indeed able to sustain him: by the metres the gods carried him, and by the metres he now carries him.
7	1	7	It is sown into the white and black hair, for these two are forms of the rik (hymn-verse) and the sâman (hymn-tune), and the rik and sâman are indeed able to sustain him (Agni): by the rik and sâman the gods carried him, and by the rik and sâman he now carries him. The hempen sling of the gold plate is a triple (cord): the significance of this has been explained.
7	1	8	He wears it over the navel; for that gold plate is yonder sun, and he (stands) over the navel (of the earth or sky).
7	1	9	And, again, why over the navel,--below the navel is the seed, the power of procreation, and the gold plate represents vital energy and vigour: (he does so, thinking,) 'Lest the gold plate burn up my seed, my power of procreation, my vital energy and vigour.'
7	1	10	And, again, why over the navel;--sacrificially purer is that part of the animal (victim) which is above the navel, and more in contact with ordure is that which is below the navel: he thus carries it (the plate) by means of that part of the animal which is sacrificially purer.
7	1	11	And, again, why over the navel,--that part of the vital air which is immortal is above the navel, and streams out by upward breathings; but that which is mortal passes by and away from the navel: he thus makes him (the Sacrificer) obtain the part of the vital air which is immortal, and by that he then carries it (the fire).
7	1	12	Now, he carries that (fire in the pan) on a seat;--the seat (âsandî) doubtless is this earth, for on her everything here is settled (âsanna); and she indeed is able to sustain him (Agni): it was thereby that the gods carried him, and thereby he now carries him.
7	1	13	It is made of udumbara wood (ficus glomerata), for the Udumbara tree is sustenance (sustaining strength), life-sap: by means of sustenance, life-sap, he thus carries him. Moreover, that Udumbara represents all the trees here (on earth), and all the trees (together) are capable of sustaining that (fire):by means of all the trees the gods bore (or, maintained) it, and by means of all the trees does he now bear it.
7	1	14	It (the seat) is a span high; for Vishnu, as an embryo, was a span high: he thus makes the womb equal in size to the embryo. It is a cubit across; for the cubit is (the length of) the (fore-)arm, and strength is exerted by the arm. It thus is made equal to strength, and strength is indeed capable of sustaining him (Agni): by means of strength the gods did bear him, and by means of strength does he now bear him.
7	1	15	The feet and boards  are four-cornered; for there are four regions, and the regions are able to sustain him: by means of the regions the gods bore him, and by the regions does he now bear him. It is interwoven with cords of reed-grass, triple ones,--the significance of this has been explained;--and smeared over with clay,--(the significance) of this also has been explained; but it also serves to keep them from taking fire .
7	1	16	Now he carries him (Agni, the fire) by means of a netting --he, Agni, is these worlds, and the netting is the regions, for by means of the regions these worlds are able to stand; and inasmuch as they are so able (sak), it is called a netting (sikya): he thus carries him by means of the regions. It is furnished with six strings,--for there are sixregions;--made of reed-grass, triply wound--the significance of this has been explained;--and smeared with clay--(the significance) of this also has been explained; but it also serves to keep them from taking fire.
7	1	17	The waters are his (Agni's) foundation, for on the waters these worlds are founded. The sun is the connecting link , for to the sun these worlds are linked by means of the quarters: whosoever thus knows this, carries suchlike a one by suchlike a one .
7	1	18	And, again, why he carries him by means of a netting,--he, Agni, is the year, and the netting is the seasons; for by means of the seasons the year is able to exist, and inasmuch as it is so able (sak), therefore (the netting is called) 'sikya:' he thus carries him by the seasons. It is furnished with six strings, for there are six seasons.
7	1	19	Day and night are his foundation, for on day and night this year is founded. The moon is the connecting link, for to the moon this year is linked by means of the seasons: whosoever thus knows this, carries suchlike a one by suchlike a one. And verily by him who so knows this, he (Agni) is carried for a year; and by him who does not so know it, he is attended to for a year . Thus as to the deities,--
7	1	20	Now as to the self (or body of Agni). Agni doubtless is the self, and the netting is the vital airs, for by means of the vital airs that self is able to exist; and inasmuch as it is so able (sak) therefore (the netting is called) 'sikya:' he thus carries (sustains) him by means of the vital airs; and it is furnished with six strings, because there are six vital airs.
7	1	21	The mind is his foundation, for on the mind this body is founded,--and food is the connecting link, for to food this body is linked by means of the vital airs: whosoever thus knows this, carries suchlike (Agni) by suchlike means.
7	1	22	Now he carries him by means of the fire-pan; for the pan is these worlds, and these worlds are indeed able to hold him: by means of these worlds the gods carried him, and by means of them he (the Sacrificer) now carries him.
7	1	23	And as to why it is called 'Ukhâ;'--by means of this sacred performance and this process the gods at that time dug out these worlds; and inasmuch as they so dug out (ut-khan), it (the pan representing the worlds) is called 'utkhâ,'--'utkhâ' being what they mysteriously (esoterically) call 'ukhâ,' for the gods love the mysterious.
7	1	24	Now 'ukhâ' (consists of) two syllables,--the Sacrificer is two-footed, and the Sacrificer is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus carries him. And that same (pan) is a pot (kumbhî), it is a cauldron (sthâlî) ; thismakes six (syllables),--six seasons are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.
7	1	25	He now takes hold of him (Agni ) by means of two (straw) pads ; for he, Agni, is yonder sun, and the two pads are day and night he thus takes hold of yonder sun by means of the day and the night, and hence that (sun)  is encompassed by day and night.
7	1	26	And, again, why he takes hold of him by means of two pads,--he, Agni, is yonder sun, and the two pads are these two worlds: he thus encompasses yonder sun by these two worlds, and hence he is encompassed by these two worlds. They are round, for these two worlds are round; of reed-grass, triply wound,--the significance of this has been told;--and smeared with clay,--(the significance) of this also has been told, but it also serves to keep them from taking fire.
7	1	27	Now then the (mystic) correspondence (of the number of objects to the nature of Agni),--the seat, the fire-pan, the sling of the gold plate, the fire, and the gold plate,--these amount to six;--six seasons are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become. Two pads, that makes eight,--the Gâyatrî has eight syllables, and Agni is Gâyatra as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.
7	1	28	Now the total correspondence,--four feet and four boards (of the seat), the netting, and the sling of the gold plate, or any other corded netting; after that the pan and fire, and the gold plate,--that makes thirteen;--thirteen months are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.
7	2	1	Standing he puts on that (gold plate) ,--for that gold plate is yonder sun, and yonder sun stands, as it were; and moreover, while standing one is stronger.  standing with his face towards north-east: the significance of this has been explained.
7	2	2	'Looking like  a golden disk he hath shone far and wide,'--for that gold plate, being seen, indeed shines far and wide;--'flashing forth unquenchable  life for glory,'--for not easily dying is his (Agni's) life (vital power); and for glory he does shine;--'Agni became immortal by his powers, when Dyaus bore him--,' for Dyaus (the sky) did bear him;--'she that hath good seed--,' for good seed indeed she has whose seed he (Agni) is.
7	2	3	He then takes hold of him by means of the two pads, with , 'Night and Dawn,of one mind, unlike in form,'--night and dawn, doubtless, are day and night, (and they are) of one mind , and unlike in form;--'nourish one child, combining together,'--whatever belongs to the day and the night, therewith they, combining together, indeed nourish him (Agni);--'a golden disk, he shineth between heaven and earth,'--whilst taking it (the fire), he mutters this prayer; for heaven and earth are those two, the sky and the earth; and moving between these two he shines: that is why, in taking it, he mutters this prayer;--'the wealth-giving gods kept Agni;'--therewith, having taken hold of it in both hands, he sets it down; for the wealth-giving gods are the vital airs, and they indeed kept up Agni at first: by means of them he now keeps him up.
7	2	4	He then puts round his (neck) the sling of the netting, with , 'The wise putteth on all forms,'--the wise one, doubtless, is yonder sun, and the netting is all forms;--'he hath brought forth what is good for the two-footed and four-footed,'--for in rising he does bring forth what is good for the two-footed and four-footed;--'the adorable Savitri hath glanced over the firmament,'--the firmament, doubtless, is the heaven, and even in rising he looks along it;--'he flasheth forth after the starting  of the Dawn,'--for the Dawn shines forth first, and after her shining forth he (the sun) follows, flashing forth.
7	2	5	By means of the fashioning (formula) he then fashions him out of that (matter): he therebyfashions that infused seed, whence the seed infused into the womb is fashioned.
7	2	6	'A well-winged bird thou art!'--the well-winged bird means vigour: he thus forms him so as to be (endowed with) vigour;--'the Trivrit is thy head,'--he thus makes the Trivrit stoma (nine-versed hymn) his head;--'the Gâyatra thine eye,'--he thus makes the Gâyatrî metre his eye;--'the Brihat and Rathantara thy wings,'--he thus makes the Brihat and Rathantara (hymn-tunes) his wings;--'the hymn is the self,'--the Pañkavimsa stoma (twenty-five-versed hymn) he makes the self (soul, or body);--'the metres the limbs,'--for the metres are indeed his (Agni's) limbs;--'the prayers his name,'--the prayers (yagus) are his name 'Agni' by which they call him,--'the Vâmadevya sâman is thy body,'--the body, doubtless, is the self: thus 'the Vâmadevya (hymn-tune) is thy body, thy self; 'the Yagñâyagñiya thy tail,'--he thus makes the Yagñâyagñiya  his tail;--'the hearths thy hoofs,'--by means of the hearths he (Agni) is indeed established in this world;--'thou art a well-winged bird: go to the heaven! fly to the light!'--thus having made him a well-winged , bird he says, 'Go to the gods! fly to the heavenly world!
7	2	7	He fashions him here (in the pan or womb) into (a bird) with wings and tail; for whatlike the seed is fashioned in the womb, suchlike it is born; and because he here fashions him as (a bird) withwings and tail, therefore he is hereafter born with wings and tail.
7	2	8	Now some, after addressing him by that fashioning (formula), build a different altar (than of an eagle's shape), either one constructed in the form of a trough , or like a chariot-wheel, or like a kite, or like the front part of a thill, or like a thill on both sides, or one consisting of a heap of loose soil . Let him not do so, (but) in such wise as one might carve a young one with wings and tail: let him therefore build it (the fire-altar) in the form of an eagle.
7	2	9	With that fashioning (formula) he holds him high up from thence towards east ; for he, Agni, is yonder sun: he thus places yonder sun high up from here in the east; and hence yonder sun is placed high up from here in the east. He holds him up so as to be beyond the reach of the arms, for he (the sun) is beyond the reach of the arms from here. He then lowers him, and, having lowered him, he holds him above the navel: the significance of this has been explained .
7	2	10	He then strides the Vishnu-strides . For the gods, in the form of Vishnu (the sun), then strode through these worlds; and inasmuch as, in the form of Vishnu, they thus strode, they are called the Vishnu-strides: in like manner does the Sacrificer,in the form of Vishnu, now stride through these worlds.
7	2	11	Now he who is Vishnu is this sacrifice; and he who is this sacrifice is that same Agni in the ukhâ (fire-pan): into that same (Agni) the gods changed themselves, and strode through these worlds; and in like manner the Sacrificer, having changed himself into that same (Agni), strides through these worlds.
7	2	12	Standing with his face towards north-east (he strides); for standing towards north-east Pragâpati created offspring by means of the Vishnu-strides: in like manner does the Sacrificer now, standing towards north-east, create offspring by means of the Vishnu-strides.
7	2	13	'Thou art Vishnu's stride,'--for in the form of Vishnu he strides; 'the slayer of foes;'--for he now slays his foes;--'mount thou the Gâyatrî metre,'--the Gâyatrî metre he does mount,--'stride along the earth!'--along the earth he indeed strides. He stretches forward his (right) foot and strides: he raises the fire upwards, for upwards he ascends.
7	2	14	'Thou art Vishnu's stride,'--for in the form of Vishnu he strides;--'the slayer of plotters,'--for he now does slay the plotters;--'mount thou the Trishtubh metre!'--the Trishtubh metre he does mount;--'stride along the air!'--along the air he indeed strides. He stretches forward his foot and strides: he raises the fire (yet further) upwards, for upwards he ascends.
7	2	15	'Thou art Vishnu's stride,'--for in the form of Vishnu he strides;--'the slayer of the evil-minded,'--for he now does slay the evil-minded;-- 'Mount the Gagatî metre!'--for the Gagatî metre he does mount;--'stride along the sky!'--along the sky he indeed strides. He stretches his foot forward and strides: he raises the fire (yet further) upwards, for upwards he ascends.
7	2	16	'Thou art Vishnu's stride,'--for in the form of Vishnu he strides;--'the slayer of the hostile,'--for he now does slay the hostile;--'mount thou the Anushtubh metre!'--the Anushtubh metre he does mount;--'stride along the quarters!'--he looks along the (four) quarters; he does not stretch forward his foot, thinking, 'Lest I lose these worlds!'--He raises the fire right up, for he ascends completely (to the top).
7	3	1	He then holds it (the fire in the pan) up thus (towards north-east). Now the gods at that time were desiring, 'May we be like Parganya (the rain-god)!' By that body (of his ) they became like Parganya, and in like manner does the Sacrificer by that body (of his) become like Parganya.
7	3	2	'Agni roared like the thundering sky,'--for he (Agni) indeed roars like the thundering Parganya;--'again and again licking the ground, stroking  the plants,'--for Parganya, whilst licking again andagain the ground, does stroke the plants;--'scarce born, the kindled shone forth,'--for scarce born he indeed lights up everything here;--'with his light he shineth between the two worlds,'--the two worlds, doubtless, are the heaven and the earth, and these two he indeed illumes by his light. He holds it (the fire in the pan) up so as to be beyond the reach of his arms, for Parganya is beyond the reach of (our) arms.
7	3	3	He then lowers it; for whatever sap, whatever sustenance there is in this world, that rises upwards with it through these worlds, for Agni is the sap, Agni is the substance in this world: thus were that always to be so , then there would be no sap, no sustenance in this world; but when he lowers (the fire), he bestows sap and sustenance on this world.
7	3	4	And, again, why he lowers it,--he then indeed rises upwards from here through these worlds: that is, as it were, a rising away from here. But this earth is the resting-place; and were that always to be so, the Sacrificer would be removed from this world. But when he lowers (the fire), he thereby comes back to this resting-place, and stands firmly on this resting-place.
7	3	5	And, again, why he lowers it,--there, indeed, in rising upwards, he conquers these worlds from here: that is, as it were, a conquering in a forward direction. Now the conquest of him who conquers only in a forward direction is completed by others; but for him who conquers both ways there is free scope: thus, when he lowers (the fire) he conquersthese worlds both from here upwards and from thence backwards.
7	3	6	'Ever returning Agni, turn thou back unto me, with life, with vigour, with offspring, with riches; with gain, with wisdom, with wealth, with prosperity!--O Agni, Aṅgiras! may thine be a hundred courses, and a thousand returns: with increase of increase bring back what was lost by us, and bring us again riches!--Return again with sustenance, again, O Agni, with food and life, guard us again from trouble!--With wealth return, O Agni, overflow with the all-feeding stream on every side!'--that is, 'with all this return thou to me!' Four times he lowers (the fire further and further), for four times it rises upwards: thus as often as it rises upwards, so often he lowers it; and having lowered it (completely), he holds it above his navel: the significance of this has been explained .
7	3	7	He then addresses him (Agni); for Agni is vital power: he thus lays vital power into his self:  'Hither have I brought thee,'--for they do indeed bring him hither;--'thou hast entered,'--he then lays vital power into his self;--'stand thou firm, never staggering!'--he thus lays the vital power firmly into his self;--'may all the people long for thee!'--the people are food: thus, 'may all food long for thee!'--'may thy rule not fall away from thee!'--rule means glory: thus, 'may thy glory not fall away from thee!'
7	3	8	He then unties the sling of the netting, and the sling of the gold plate; for the sling belongs to Varuna: he thus frees himself from Varuna's noose. He does so with a verse to Varuna: he thus frees himself from Varuna's noose by its own self, by its own deity.  'Take off from us, O Varuna, the uppermost cord, down (take) the lowest, away the middle one!'--as the text, so the meaning;--'and so, O Âditya, may we be sinless in thy service for safety (Aditi)!'--Aditi is this earth: thus, 'Sinless may we belong to thee and to her (the earth)!'
7	3	9	He then holds him (Agni) up thus (towards south-east); for on that former occasion he raises him upwards from here towards the east with the fashioning formula ; and he then holds him up thus (towards north-east ). Now were that alone to take place, he (the sun), surely, would stop even there (in the north); but inasmuch as he now holds him up thus (towards south-east), he (the sun) having gone thus (in a northerly direction), then comes back again thus (in a southerly direction).
7	3	10	'The great hath stood up erect before the Dawns,'--for before the dawn the great one (Agni) indeed stands up erect;--'emerged from the gloom he hath come with light,'--for emerged from the gloom, the night, he indeed comes with light, with the day;--'well-shapen with white light,'--for he, Agni, is indeed well-shapen with white light;'--'when born, he hath filled all homesteads;'--all homesteads, doubtless, means these worlds, and these he indeed fills, when born. He holds him up so as to be beyond the reach of the arms, for he (thesun) is beyond the reach of arms from here. He then lowers him: he thereby comes back to this resting-place, and stands firmly on this resting-place.  with a gagatî verse , for the Gagatî gains these worlds from above hitherwards.
7	3	11	'The swan dwelling in the light,'--the swan dwelling in the light, doubtless, is yonder sun;--'the Vasu dwelling in the air,'--the Vasu dwelling in the air, doubtless, is the wind;--'the priest seated on the altar,'--the priest seated on the altar, doubtless, is Agni;--'the guest,'--for he (Agni) is indeed the guest of all beings;--'dwelling in the retreat ,'--that is, 'dwelling in rugged places;'--'the man-dwelling,'--the man-dwelling, doubtless, is the vital air; and men are human beings: he thus means that vital air, that fire, which (burns) in human beings;--'the space-dwelling,'--for he (Agni) indeed is seated in all spaces;--'the law-seated,'--that is, 'the truth-seated;'--'the sphere-dwelling,'--for he is indeed seated in all spheres;--'the water-born, cow-born'--for he is indeed both water-born and cow-born;--'law-born,'--that is, 'truth-born;'--'rock-born,'--for he is born from the rock;--'the law,'--that is, 'the truth.' With 'the Great!' he deposits it (the fire); for he (Agni) is indeed the great (truth): he thus deposits him (on the seat) after making him what he is.
7	3	12	with two syllables ('brihat'),--the Sacrificer is two-footed, and the Sacrificer is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus deposits him.
7	3	13	He then stands worshipping by him; for he makes, as it were, light of him, when he strides with him through these worlds both thus (upwards), and thus (downwards): he now makes amends to him, so that he (Agni) may not hurt him.
7	3	14	And, again, why he stands by him;--the gods at that time were afraid, lest he should injure these worlds of theirs from anigh: they thereby appeased him towards these worlds; and in like manner does he (the Sacrificer) now appease him towards these worlds.
7	3	15	'Seat thee in this thy mother's lap, thou, O Agni, knowing all ordinances! burn her not with thy heat, thy flame! shine in her with a brilliant light!--Glowing with light and heat within thine own seat, be thou gracious unto this Ukhâ, O knower of beings!--Being gracious unto me, O Agni, now seat thee graciously! seat thee here in thine own seat, having made happy all the regions!'--by saying 'Gracious--Gracious,' he appeases him, so that he may not injure any one, and thus he, being appeased, does not injure these worlds.
7	3	16	With three (verses) he stands by worshipping;--three in number are these worlds, and threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thereby makes amends to him, and with so much does he thereby appease him towards these worlds.
7	4	1	He then stands by him worshipping with the Vâtsapra rite , For Pragâpati, having by means of the Vishnu-strides produced creatures, created vital power for them by means of the Vâtsapra rite; and in like manner the Sacrificer, having, by means of the Vishnu-strides, produced creatures (or, subjects), creates vital power for them by means of the Vâtsapra rite.
7	4	2	Now the Vâtsapra rite, doubtless, is he, the golden-handed  (Agni);--hence whomsoever that is born one may wish to obtain the full (measure of) life, let him touch that one with the Vâtsapra rite, and he thereby creates vital power for that newborn one; and accordingly that one obtains the full (measure of) life. And whomsoever one may wish to be vigorous, let him first address that one with the Vikriti (fashioning) formula , and that one accordingly becomes vigorous.
7	4	3	'From the sky Agni was first born;'--the sky, doubtless, is the breath, and from the breath he (Agni) was indeed first born,--'from us the second time, the knower of beings,'--inasmuch as he, man-like, on that occasion generated him a second time ;--'thethird time in the waters,'--inasmuch as he there did generate him a third time from the waters;--'he, the manly-minded, (kindling him) the imperishable,'--the manly-minded, doubtless, is Pragâpati; and the imperishable, Agni ;--'kindling him the mindful praises (gar) him,'--for he who kindles him generates him, mindful.
7	4	4	'We know, O Agni, thy threefold three,'--Agni, Vâyu (wind), Âditya (sun), these are his three in three forms;--'We know thy manifold scattered sites,'--inasmuch as he (Agni) is here distributed ;--'we know thy highest name which is in secret,'--'the youngest,' that indeed is his highest name in secret;--'we know that source whence thou art come;'--the source, doubtless, is the (heavenly) waters, for from the waters he first came.
7	4	5	'In the sea the manly-minded (kindled) thee, in the waters,'--the manly-minded is Pragâpati: thus, 'In the waters Pragâpati (kindled) thee;'--'the man-watcher hath kindled thee, O Agni, in the udder of the sky,'--the man-watcher, doubtless, is Pragâpati, and the udder of the sky is the waters ;--'thee, whilst standing in the third region,'--the third region, doubtless, is the sky;--'the buffaloes made (thee) grow in the lap of the waters ;'--the buffaloes, doubtless, arethe vital airs: thus, 'the vital airs made thee grow in the sky.'
7	4	6	These (three verses ) have one and the same explanation regarding him (Agni): they are Trishtubh verses relating to Agni. Inasmuch as they relate to Agni, they are Agni; and inasmuch as they are Trishtubhs, and eleven (syllables), they are Indra;--but Agni consists of Indra and Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus stands worshipping by him. And Indra and Agni are all the gods, and Agni includes (or belongs to) all the deities: as great as Agni is, asgreat as is his measure, with so much he thus stands worshipping by him.
7	4	7	And, again, why the Vishnu-strides and the Vâtsapra rite are (performed);--by the Vishnu-strides Pragâpati created this world, and by the Vâtsapra the fire (Agni); by the Vishnu-strides Pragâpati created the air, and by the Vâtsapra the wind (Vâyu); by the Vishnu-strides Pragâpati created the sky, and by the Vâtsapra the sun (Âditya); by the Vishnu-strides Pragâpati created the regions, and by the Vâtsapra the moon; by the Vishnu-strides Pragâpati created that which has been, and by the Vâtsapra that which shall be; by the Vishnu-strides Pragâpati created possession (wealth), and by the Vâtsapra hope; by the Vishnu-strides Pragâpati created the day, and by the Vâtsapra the night; by the Vishnu-strides Pragâpati created the former (bright) fortnights, and by the Vâtsapra the latter (dark) fortnights; by the Vishnu-strides Pragâpati created the half-months, and by the Vâtsapra the months; by the Vishnu-strides Pragâpati created the seasons, and by the Vâtsapra the year: thus the reason why the Vishnu-strides and Vâtsapra are (performed) is that he thereby even now creates everything.
7	4	8	And, again, why the Vishnu-strides and the Vâtsapra rite are (performed). By the Vishnu-strides Pragâpati drove up to heaven. He saw that unyoking-place, the Vâtsapra, and unyoked thereat to prevent chafing; for when the yoked (beast) is not unloosed, it is chafed. In like manner the Sacrificer drives up to heaven by the Vishnu-strides; and unyokes by means of the Vâtsapra.
7	4	9	Having stridden the Vishnu-strides, he thenforthwith stands by the fire worshipping it with the Vâtsapra, just as one who has journeyed would forthwith unyoke. Men (proceed) after the manner of the gods: hence even now, when a troop of men have journeyed they forthwith unyoke.
7	4	10	Now, the Vishnu-strides indeed are the day and the night, and the Vâtsapra is the day and the night: he thus journeys for a day and a night, and takes rest for a day and a night: and hence even now when a troop of men have journeyed for a day and a night they take rest for a day and a night.
7	4	11	Only for one half of the year he strides the Vishnu-strides, and for one half he worships the fire with the Vâtsapra; for the world of heaven is in the midst of the year: thus were he to stride for less than half (a year), he would not reach that world of heaven; and were he to do so for more than half (a year), he would pass beyond that world of heaven and lose it; but when he strides for one half, and worships the fire for one half, he unyokes forthwith after reaching the world of heaven.
7	4	12	He proceeds with these two alternately , even as one would accomplish a long way by (repeatedly) unyoking. Both before and after (the Dîkshâ), he combines both, the Vishnu-strides and the Vâtsapra; for the Vishnu-strides are the day, and the Vâtsapra the night; and Pragâpati, both when he was about to generate and when he had generated this universe, enclosed it on both sides by day and night: in likemanner the Sacrificer now, both when he is about to generate and when he has generated this universe, encloses it on both sides by day and night.
7	4	13	As to this they say, 'If the Vishnu-strides are the day, and the Vâtsapra the night, and both of them are (performed) during the day, not during the night, how then are they both performed for (or by) him also during the night?' Well, on that (first) occasion, when he is being initiated, he, at the outset, combines both (performances) in the afternoon; for the afternoon is the same thing as the night. Then throwing them thus together, he at the end combines them both in the forenoon; for the forenoon is the same thing as the day; and in this way they are both performed during the day, and both during the night.
7	4	14	Now early on the day on which he may intend to combine them, when the sun has risen, he first throws out the ashes (from the pan); having thrown out the ashes, he releases his speech; having released his speech, he puts on a kindling-stick; having put on a kindling-stick, he takes the ashes down to (and throws them into) the water. In the same way as he takes them down he returns after taking some of the ashes; and having thrown it into the pan he stands reverentially by the fire. He then performs two expiations.
7	4	15	And if the day should be one for the Vishnu-strides, let him, after striding the Vishnu-strides, worship the fire with the Vâtsapra; and if it be one for the Vâtsapra, let him, after worshipping with the Vâtsapra, and striding the Vishnu-strides, finally perform the Vâtsapra. Let him not conclude by performing the Vishnu-strides, for that would be as ifafter going for a drive he were not to unyoke; but when he concludes by performing the Vâtsapra--the Vâtsapra being a halting-place--(it is) as if he made a halt and unloosed (the team): let him therefore conclude by performing the Vâtsapra.
8	1	1	'Let him drive Agni about while keeping him up, so they say. The gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from , were contending. The gods drove about on wheels (cars), and the Asuras stayed at home. The gods, while driving about on wheels, saw  this rite (sacrificial performance), for it was indeed in driving about on wheels that they saw this rite: hence it is to the cart that the formulas relate at the (performance with) sacrificial cakes , and to the cart in the building of the fire-altar .
8	1	2	Now he who drives Agni about goes to the gods by the sacred performance, for divine is the rite performed by him; but he who does not drive him about goes to the Asuras by the sacred performance, for demoniac is the rite performed by him.
8	1	3	Here now some say, 'It is by himself that he (Agni) is driven about; for by the Vishnu-strides he drives forward, and by the Vâtsapra he unyokes.' Let him not think this to be so; for divine (to the gods) is that progress of his, to wit, the Vishnu-strides; and divine the unyoking, to wit, the Vâtsapra. But human would be that progress of his, which he makes in this manner, and human the unyoking he makes.
8	1	4	This Agni is Pragâpati; and Pragâpati is both the gods and men. Now when the Vishnu-strides and the Vâtsapra are (performed), he thereby makes up that form of his which is divine; and when he drives him about he thereby makes up that form of his which is human. Verily, then, he who, knowing this, drives him about, makes up that whole and entire Pragâpati: let him therefore by all means drive him (Agni) about.
8	1	5	Now on any day on which he may intend to drive, he gets the chariot placed north of the fire (with the pole) to the east; and puts a kindling-stick on it (the fire); for at that time the gods first regaled him (Agni) with food, with that kindling-stick, when he was about to start: and in like manner does this one now first regale him with food, with that kindling-stick, when he is about to start.
8	1	6	'With fuel serve ye Agni!'--that is, 'with fuel worship ye Agni!'--'with draughts of ghee awake ye the guest, offer ye libations unto him!'--that is, 'with (draughts of) ghee do ye awake the guest, and offer libations unto him!'--with a (verse) containing (the verb) 'awake' he awakens him for the starting.
8	1	7	He then lifts him (the fire) up, with , 'Upwards may the All-gods bear thee, O Agni, by their thoughts!'--at the beginning all the gods did indeed bear him upwards by their thoughts, for that (or, he) was then their thought: in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now bear him upwards by his thoughts, for this now is his thought;--'be thou gracious unto us, of fair look, and rich splendour!'--as the text, so its meaning. From the south he places him (Agni) northwardson (the chariot)--the significance of this has been explained. Having put the Gârhapatya into a pot, he places it on (the chariot) behind (the Âhavanîya, or Ukhya Agni). If he choose, he himself may mount up beside him (Agni), or he may walk by the side (of the chariot).
8	1	8	He then yokes two oxen, first the right one, then the left one: so (it is done) with the gods, otherwise in human (practice). And in whatever direction he may intend to drive, let him first drive east, for the east is Agni's region: he (Agni) thus proceeds towards his own region.
8	1	9	'Go forth, O Agni, brilliant thou with propitious flames!'--that is, 'Brilliant, O Agni, go thou forth with propitious, shining flames!'--'Beaming with great beams injure not my people with thy body!'--that is, 'With great shining flames do not injure my people by thyself!'
8	1	10	Whenever the axle creaks, let him mutter that prayer ; for demoniacal is that voice which is in the axle: he thereby appeases that (voice) and makes it as of the gods.
8	1	11	And, again, why he mutters that prayer;--with whomsoever, mounted (on a chariot), the axle creaks, this is his own voice: hence when the axle creaks while Agni is mounted, this is the voice of Agni himself. It was Agni indeed whom the gods thereby praised and magnified; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) thereby praise and magnify him: 'Agni roared like the thundering sky,'--the meaning of this has been explained .
8	1	12	If he unyokes before (reaching) his dwelling, let the fire remain on the chariot itself; but when he unyokes for (staying at) his dwelling, he stops the chariot (with the pole) to the east; and north of it he raises and sprinkles (a place) where he takes it (the fire) down. He takes it down from south to north: the meaning of this has been explained.
8	1	13	He then puts a kindling-stick thereon; for on that occasion the gods regaled him (Agni) with food, with that kindling-stick, after he had travelled: in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now regale him, after he has travelled, with food, with that kindling-stick.
8	1	14	'Far, far famed is this Agni of the Bharata (tribe),'--the Bharata , doubtless, is Pragâpati, for he sustains (bhar) this entire (universe);--'that his great light shineth brightly, as the sun,'--that is, 'that, like the sun, his great light shines brightly;'--'he who overthrew Pûru in battles,'--Pûru, by name, was an Âsura-Rakshas: him Agni overthrew (abhi-sthâ) in battles;--'blazed up hath the divine guest, gracious unto us;'--that is, 'being kindled, the divine guest is gracious to us.' With a (verse) containing (the verb) 'sthâ' (he performs), for he thereby makes him stop (sthâ) for (staying at) his home.
8	1	15	Now, then, the (symbolic) correspondence,--with the first (formula) he puts on a kindling-stick, with one he lifts him up, with one he starts, with one he addresses the axle, with the fifth he puts on akindling-stick, that makes five,--of five layers consists the fire-altar, five seasons are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.
8	2	1	Now, then, as to the taking down of the ashes (to the water ). Now, the gods at that time threw out the ashes (from the pan). They said, 'If we make this, such as it is, part of our own self, we shall become mortal carcases, not freed from sin; and if we cast it away, we shall put outside of Agni what therein is of Agni's nature: find ye out in what manner we shall do this!'--They said, 'Meditate ye (kit)!' whereby, indeed, they said, 'Seek ye a layer (or altar, kiti). Seek ye in what manner we shall do this!'
8	2	2	While meditating, they saw this,--'Let us take it down to the water; for the water is the foundation of this universe: having settled it on that wherein is the foundation of this universe, we shall reproduce from out of the water what there is of Agni's nature in this (heap of ashes).' They then took it down to (and threw it into) the water; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now take it down to the water.
8	2	3	'O divine waters, receive ye these ashes, and put them in a soft and fragrant place!'--that, being consumed (matter), has run its course (is useless): regarding that he says, 'Put it in, the most fragrant place!'--'Maythe wives, wedded to a good lord, bow down to him,'--the wives, doubtless, are the waters, for from the waters this universe is produced; and in Agni the waters have indeed a good lord;--'bear it on the waters, even as a mother (bears) her son!'--that is, 'as a mother would bear her son on her lap, so bear ye this!'
8	2	4	'In the waters, O Agni, is thy seat,'--that is, 'in the waters, O Agni, is thy womb; as such thou clingest to the plants,'--for he does indeed cling to (love) the plants,--'being in (their) womb thou art born again,'--when he is in the womb he is indeed born again,-- 'Thou art the child of the herbs, the child of the trees, the child of all that is, O Agni, thou art the child of the waters;'--he thus makes him (Agni) the child of this entire (universe).
8	2	5	With three (verses) he throws (the ashes into the water),--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus throws them down. First with one (prayer), and then with two; or first with two, and then with one,--but at two separate times he throws them down: he thus throws them down by means of the two-footed animals.
8	2	6	He then takes some (of the ashes) therefrom: he thereby reproduces from the waters what there is of Agni's nature in that (heap of ashes).  with that (nameless or little finger), for with that (finger) medicine is prepared: it is with that one he thus puts him (Agni) together.  'Having settled  in the womb, asashes, in the waters, and the earth, O Agni,'--by his ashes he is, indeed, settled in the womb, that is, both in the waters and in the earth;--'having united with the mothers, thou hast again, brightly shining, seated thee;'--that is, 'Having joined thy mothers, thou, the shining one, hast again seated thyself (in thy home).'--'Having again seated thee in thy seat, the waters and the earth, O Agni, thou liest in her (the earth, or pan) most happy, as in a mother's lap.'--'Return again with sustenance, again, O Agni, with food and life; guard us again from trouble!--With wealth return, O Agni, overflow with the all-feeding stream on every side!'--that is, 'With all this return thou to me!'
8	2	7	With four (verses) he takes (some of the ashes);--he thereby supplies him (Agni) with four-footed animals; and animals being food, it is with food he thus supplies him. With three (verses) he takes (the ashes) down (to the water),--that makes seven, for of seven layers consists the fire-altar , seven seasons are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.
8	2	8	Having taken some of the ashes, and returned, he throws it into the fire-pan, and stands by (the fire) worshipping it; for when he throws Agni into the water he does what is improper; he now makes amends to him so that he may not injure him. With two (verses) relating to Agni (he worships),--for it is to Agni that he makes amends,--and with suchas contain (the verb) 'budh' (to attend to, awake), in order that Agni may attend to this speech of his.
8	2	9	'Attend thou to this word of mine, O youngest!'--that is, 'attend to this word of mine, O youngest!'--'put forth most plentifully, O faithful one!'--that is, 'put forth most abundantly, O faithful one!'--'this one revileth thee, and that one singeth thy praises,'--that is, 'one (man) reviles thee, and another sings thy praises;'--'reverently I revere thy body, O Agni!'--that is, 'I, thy reverer, revere thy body, O Agni!'--'Be thou a munificent patron of offerings, O lord of wealth, the bestower of wealth, keep off from us the haters!' this he says in order that he may keep off haters from him. With two (verses) he worships the fire, a Gâyatrî and a Trishtubh verse: the significance of this has been explained.
8	2	10	These make nine (verses),--there are nine regions , and Agni is the regions; nine vital airs, and Agni is the vital airs: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.
8	2	11	He then performs two expiations; for it is for (the obtainment of) all his desires that he sets up that (fire);--thus whatever part of his desires is here cut off when the fire is thrown into the water, that he thereby joins together and restores. He performs both expiations which (are performed) when the fire has gone out : the significance of this has been explained.
8	2	12	This makes ten (performances),--the Virâg consists of ten syllables, and Agni is the Virâg ; there are ten regions, and Agni is the regions; ten vital airs, and Agni is the vital airs: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.
