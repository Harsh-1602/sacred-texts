1	1	1	Once upon a time the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pragâpati, strove together. And the Asuras, even through arrogance, thinking, 'Unto whom, forsooth, should we make offering?' went on offering into their own mouths. They came to naught, even through arrogance: wherefore let no one be arrogant, for verily arrogance is the cause  of ruin.
1	1	2	But the gods went on making offerings unto one another. Pragâpati gave himself up to them: thus the sacrifice  became theirs; and indeed the sacrifice is the food of the gods .
1	1	3	They then spake, 'To which of us shall this  belong?' They did not agree together, saying, 'To me! to me!' Not being agreed, they said, 'Let us run a race for it: whichever of us shall win, to him it shall belong!'--'So be it!' so they ran a race for it.
1	1	4	Then Brihaspati hasted up to Savitri for his impulsion ,--Savitri being the impeller (prasavitri) among the gods--saying, 'Impel this for me, (so that) impelled by thee, I may win this!' Then Savitri, as the impeller, impelled it for him, and impelled by Savitri, he won: he became everything here, he won everything here; for he won Pragâpati, and Pragâpati (the lord of creatures and procreation) indeed is everything here. By offering therewith he (Brihaspati) ascended to that upper region. Therefore who so knoweth, and who so knoweth not,--they say, 'That upper region belongeth to Brihaspati.'
1	1	5	Thus they who of old used to offer the Vâgapeya, ascended to that upper region. From there Aupâvi Gânasruteya descended again: thenceforward (all men) descend again.
1	1	6	Indra offered that (Vâgapeya),--he became everything here, he won everything here; for he won Pragâpati, and Pragâpati  is everything here: by offering therewith he ascended to that upper region.
1	1	7	Thus they who of old used to offer the Vâgapeya, ascended to that upper region. From there Aupâvi Gânasruteya descended' again: thenceforward (all men) descend again.
1	1	8	And whosoever offers the Vâgapeya, he becomes everything here, he wins everything here; for he wins Pragâpati, and Pragâpati indeed is everything here.
1	1	9	Here now they say, 'One must not offer the Vâgapeya; for he who offers the Vâgapeya wins everything here,--for he wins Pragâpati, and Pragâpati is everything here,--he leaves nothing remaining here: his people (or offspring) is like to become worse (off).'
1	1	10	Let him none the less sacrifice: whatever (priests) thus know that sacrifice properly, in respect of the Rik, the Yagus, and the Sâman, and such as are proficient, let them assist him in offering it; for verily this is the perfection of that sacrifice, when wise (priests) assist him in offering it: let him therefore sacrifice by all means.
1	1	11	Now truly this (the Vâgapeya) is the Brâhmana's own sacrifice, inasmuch as Brihaspati (the lord of prayer and devotion) performed it; for Brihaspati is the Brahman (priesthood, or priestly dignity), and the Brâhmana is the Brahman. And it is also that of the Râganya, inasmuch as Indri performed it; for Indra is the Kshatra (nobility, or ruling power), and the Râganya is the Kshatra.
1	1	12	To the king (râgan) doubtless belongs the Râgasûya; for by offering the Râgasûya he becomes king; and unsuited for kingship is the Brâhmana. And, moreover, the Râgasûya is the lower, and the Vâgapeya the higher (sacrifice).
1	1	13	For by offering the Râgasûya  he becomes king, and by the Vâgapeya (he becomes) emperor (samrâg); and the office of king is the lower, and that of emperor the higher: a king might indeed wish to become emperor, for the office of king is the lower, and that of emperor the higher; but the emperor would not wish to become king, for the office of king is the lower, and that of emperor the higher.
1	1	14	Thus that (king) who, by performing the Vâgapeya, becomes emperor, possesses himself of everything here. Previously to each performance (of an ishti ) he offers that oblation to Savitri (the sun), with the text, 'O divine Savitri, impel (prosper) the sacrifice, impel Pragâpati for his portion!'
1	1	15	And even as then Brihaspati hasted up to Savitri for his impulsion Savitri being the impeller among the gods--saying, 'Impel this for me, (so that) impelled by thee I may win it!' and Savitri, as the impeller, impelled it for him; and impelled by Savitri he won it; even so does this (sacrificing king) now haste up to Savitri for his impulsion--Savitri being the impeller among the gods--saying, 'Impel this for me: may I win it, impelled by thee!' and Savitri, as the impeller, impels it for him, and he wins it impelled by Savitri.
1	1	16	Wherefore he says , 'God Savitri, speed the sacrifice, speed the lord of sacrifice unto his portion! May the heavenly. thought-cleansing Gandharva cleanse our thought! May the Lord of Speech render our meat palatable, hail!' For the Lord of Speech is Pragâpati, and meat means food: 'May Pragâpati this day make palatable this our food!' thus he thereby says. This same oblation he offers till the day before the Soma-feast, for thus that performance of his has been commenced; and he (Savitri, the Sun) becomes serene during that sacrifice.
1	2	1	He draws the Amsu  (graha), just for completeness’ sake, for it is  that he drawsthe Amsu. After that he draws those recognised Agnishtoma cups  up to the Âgrayana.
1	2	2	, He then draws the Prishthyas : and whatever the gods (Agni, Indra, and Sûrya) won by them, even that he wins by them.
1	2	3	He then draws the Shodasin: and whatever Indra won thereby, even that he (the sacrificer) wins thereby.
1	2	4	He then draws those five Vâgapeya cups (for Indra; the first) with the text , 'Thee, the firm-seated, the man-seated, the mind-seated! Thou art taken with a support : I take thee, agreeable to Indra! This is thy womb' (i.e. thy home): thee, most agreeable to Indra!' therewith he deposits it; for of theseworlds this one, to wit the earth, is the firm one: this same world he thereby wins.
1	2	5	'Thee, the water-seated, the ghee-seated, the ether-seated! Thou art taken with a support: I take thee, agreeable to Indra! This is thy womb: thee most agreeable to Indra!' therewith he deposits it; for among these worlds that ether (mentioned in the formula) is this air: he thereby wins this air-world.
1	2	6	'Thee, the earth-seated, the air-seated, the sky-seated, the god-seated, the heaven-seated! Thou art taken with a support: I take thee, agreeable to Indra! This is thy womb: thee, most agreeable to Indra!' therewith he deposits it; for god-seated, heaven-seated indeed is yonder world of the gods: the world of the gods he thereby wins.
1	2	7	'The waters’ invigorating essence, being contained in the sun,--that which is the essence of the waters’ essence, that, the most excellent, I take for you! Thou art taken with a support: I take thee, agreeable to Indra! This is thy womb: thee, most agreeable to Indra!' therewith he deposits it; for the waters’ essence is he that blows (or purifies) yonder (the wind), and he is contained in the sun, he blows from the sun: that same essence he thereby wins.
1	2	8	'Ye cups, of strengthening libations, inspiring the sage with thought,--I have gathered together the pith and sap of you, the handleless! Thou art taken with a support: thee, agreeable to Indra! This is thy womb: thee, most agreeable to Indra!' therewith he deposits it;--pith means essence: it is the essence he thereby wins.
1	2	9	These, then, are five Vâgapeya cups he draws; for he who offers the Vâgapeya wins Pragâpati; and Pragâpati is the year, and there are five seasons in the year,--he thus wins Pragâpati: therefore he draws five Vâgapeya cups.
1	2	10	He (the Adhvaryu) then draws seventeen (other) cups of Soma, and (the Neshtri) seventeen cups of Surâ (spirituous liquor), for to Pragâpati belong these two (saps of) plants, to wit the Soma and the Surâ;--and of these two the Soma is truth, prosperity, light; and the Surâ untruth, misery, darkness: both these (saps of) plants he thereby wins; for he who offers the Vâgapeya wins everything here, since he wins Pragâpati, and Pragâpati indeed is everything here.
1	2	11	Now as to why he draws seventeen cups of Soma;--Pragâpati is seventeenfold, Pragâpati is the sacrifice : as great as the sacrifice is, as great as isits measure, with that much he thus wins its truth, its prosperity, its light.
1	2	12	And why he draws seventeen cups of Surâ;--Pragâpati is seventeenfold, Pragâpati is the sacrifice: as great as the sacrifice is, as great as is its measure, with that much he thus wins its untruth, its misery, its darkness.
1	2	13	These two amount to thirty-four cups; for there are thirty-three gods, and Pragâpati is the thirty-fourth: he thus wins Pragâpati.
1	2	14	Now when he buys the king (Soma), he at the same time buys for a piece of lead the Parisrut (immature spirituous liquor) from a long-haired man near by towards the south. For a long-haired man is neither man nor woman; for, being a male, he is not a woman; and being long-haired (a eunuch), he is not a man. And that lead is neither iron nor gold; and the Parisrut-liquor is neither Soma nor Surâ : this is why he buys the Parisrut for a piece of lead from a long-haired man.
1	2	15	And on the preceding day they prepare twoearth-mounds , the one in front of the axle, and the other behind the axle: 'Lest we should deposit together the cups of Soma, and the cups of Surâ,'--this is why, on the preceding day, they prepare two mounds, one in front, and the other behind the axle.
1	2	16	Now, when they take the Vasatîvarî water  (into the havirdhâna shed) by the front door, the Neshtri takes in the Parisrut-liquor by the back door. From the south they bring in the drinking vessels. The Adhvaryu, seated in front of the axle, with his face towards the west, draws the cups of Soma; and the Neshtri, seated behind the axle, with his face towards the east, draws the cups of Surâ. The Adhvaryu draws a cup of Soma, the Neshtri a cup of Surâ; the Adhvaryu draws a cup of Soma, the Neshtri a cup of Surâ: in this way they draw them alternately.
1	2	17	Neither does the Adhvaryu hold the Soma-cup beyond the axle towards the back, nor the Neshtri the Surâ-cup beyond the axle towards the front, thinking, 'Lest we should confound light and darkness!'
1	2	18	The Adhvaryu holds the Soma-cup just over the axle, and the Neshtri the Surâ-cup just belowthe axle, with , 'United ye are: unite me with happiness!' Thinking, 'Lest we should say "evil",' they withdraw them again, with, 'Disunited ye are: disunite me from evil!' Even as one might tear a single reed from a clump of reed-grass, so do they thereby tear him from out of all evil: there is not in him so much sin as the point of a grass-blade. They deposit the two (cups each time on the mounds).
1	2	19	Thereupon the Adhvaryu draws the Madhu-graha (honey-cup) in a golden vessel, and deposits it in the middle of the Soma-grahas. He then draws the Ukthya, then the Dhruva. And when, at the last chant (of the evening press feast ), he has poured those Soma-grahas one by one into the cups of the officiating priests, they make offering and drink them. At the midday-pressing it is told regarding the honey-cup, and the cups of Surâ: thereof then .
1	3	1	At the Agnishtoma (Sâman ) he seizes a (victim) for Agni, for the Agnishtoma (i.e. 'Agni'spraise ) is Agni: he thereby wins Agni. For the Ukthas  he seizes one for Indra and Agni; for the hymns (uktha) relate to Indra and Agni : the hymns he thereby wins. For the Shodasi n he seizes one for Indra; for the Shodasin is Indra: the Shodasin (Indra) he thereby wins.
1	3	2	For the seventeenth (or seventeenfold) stotra  he seizes one for Sarasvatî: thereby, while there is no over-night performance , it is yet made like the night (performance); for he who offers the Vâgapeyawins Pragâpati, and Pragâpati is the year: by that (victim) for Sarasvatî he now wins the night: hence, while there is no night performance, it is made like the night.
1	3	3	Thereupon he seizes a spotted sterile cow for the Victorious Maruts; for the spotted sterile cow is this (earth): whatever food, rooted and rootless, is here established on her, thereby she is a spotted cow. Now, he who offers the Vâgapeya wins food, for vâga-peya  doubtless means the same as anna-peya (food and drink); and the Maruts are the peasants, and the peasants are food (for the noble). 'To the Victorious (Maruts)!' he says, even for the sake of victory. It is difficult to obtain an invitatory and offering prayer containing the word 'victorious:' if he should be unable to obtain such as contain the word 'victorious,' any other two verses to the Maruts will do. Difficult to obtain also is a spotted sterile cow: if he cannot obtain a spotted sterile cow, any other sterile cow will do.
1	3	4	The course of procedure thereof (is as follows). When the Hotri recites after the Mâhendra libation, then let them proceed with (the offering of) her omentum, for that, the Mâhendra , is Indra's special (nishkevalya) libation; and his also are the Nishkevalya-stotra and Nishkevalya-sastra. Now the sacrificer is Indra: thus he thereby puts strength into the sacrificer in the very middle (of the sacrifice):that is why they should proceed with her omentum at that particular time.
1	3	5	They cook the portions  in two lots. Of the one lot thereof, after making an 'under-layer' of ghee (clarified butter) in the guhû spoon, he makes two cuttings from each (portion), bastes them once, and replenishes with ghee (the empty places of) the cuttings. Thereupon he makes one cutting from each into the upabhrit spoon, bastes them twice, but does not replenish (the places of) the cuttings. Now, when of the one lot (of portions) he makes two cuttings from each, thereby that (sterile cow) becomes whole; and when he proceeds with those (portions), thereby he wins the divine race. He then presents the (other) half to the human kind: and thereby he wins the human kind (people, vis).
1	3	6	But let him not do it in this wise; for verily he who departs from the path of the sacrifice, stumbles; and he who does it in this wise certainly departs from the path of the sacrifice. Hence when they proceed with the omenta of the other victims, only then let them proceed with the omentum of that (cow). They cook the portions in one lot, and do not present any to the human kind.
1	3	7	He then seizes seventeen victims for Pragâpati. They are all hornless, all dark-grey , all (uncastrated) males; for he who offers the Vâgapeya, wins Pragâpati; but Pragâpati is food, and the victim (cattle) is food: he thus wins Pragâpati. And Pragâpati is Soma, and the victim is the visible Soma: he thus wins the visible Pragâpati. There are seventeen (victims), because Pragâpati is seventeenfold: he thus wins Pragâpati.
1	3	8	Now, they are all hornless;--for man is nearest to Pragâpati, and he is hornless, unhorned; and Pragâpati also is hornless, unhorned; and these (victims) belong to Pragâpati: therefore they are all hornless.
1	3	9	They are all dark-grey. Now, the dark-grey has two forms, the light hair and the black; and a couple means a productive pair, and Pragâpati (the lord of generation) represents productiveness, and those (victims) belong to Pragâpati: therefore they are all dark-grey.
1	3	10	They are all males;--for the male means productiveness, and Pragâpati represents productiveness: hence they are all males. Difficult to obtain are victims with these perfections: if he cannot obtain them (all) with these perfections, even some with these perfections will do; for verily Pragâpati is everything here.
1	3	11	Now, some seize the last (victim) for Vâk (Speech), thinking, 'If there be anything beyond Pragâpati, that is Speech: we thus win Speech.' But let him not do it in this wise; for Pragâpati is everything here,--these worlds and everything there is;--whatever speech speaks in these worlds, that speech he wins: therefore he need not heed this.
1	3	12	The course of procedure regarding these (victims is as follows). When the Maitrâvaruna recites after the Vâmadevya , let them then proceedwith their omenta; for the Vâmadevya means productiveness, and Pragâpati means productiveness, and these (victims) belong to Pragâpati: therefore let them proceed with their omenta at that time.
1	3	13	And (when) the after-offerings have been performed, and the spoons have not yet been shifted (separated) , then they proceed with the (chief) oblations of those (victims). That (point in the performance) is the end, and Pragâpati is the end: thus he wins Pragâpati at the very end. But were he to proceed therewith sooner, it would be just as if a man had already gone the way he still intends to go,--and where would he be after that ?--thereforethey proceed with their (chief) oblations at that time.
1	3	14	But let him not do it in this wise for he who departs from the path of the sacrifice stumbles; and he who does it in this wise certainly departs from the path of the sacrifice. Hence whenever they proceed with the omenta of the other victims, let them at the same time proceed with the omenta of these; and whenever they proceed with the (chief) oblations of the other victims, let them at the same time proceed with the oblations of these. There is but one invitatory prayer, and one offering prayer; for (these offerings) belong to one deity. He says (to the Maitrâvaruna), 'To Pragâpati'--saying this (name) in a low voice--'recite the invitatory prayer for the offering of the bucks!'--'To Pragâpati' saying this in a low voice--'urge the ready-standing offering of the bucks!' and as the Vashat is uttered, he makes the offering.
1	4	1	At the midday Soma-feast he consecrates (the Sacrificer) by sprinkling; and at the midday Soma-feast they run a race; for, verily, Pragâpati is that sacrifice  which is here performed, and from which these creatures have been produced,--and indeed, they are even now produced after this one: thus he thereby wins Pragâpati in the very centre (of the sacrifice).
1	4	2	The Mâhendra cup being not yet drawn,--forthat, the Mâhendra, is Indra's special (nishkevalya) cup, and so also are his that Nishkevalya-stotra and Nishkevalya-sastra; and the Sacrificer is Indra: thus he consecrates him at his own dwelling-place. Hence, the Mâhendra cup being not yet drawn,--
1	4	3	He takes down the chariot , with , 'Thou art Indra's thunderbolt;' for the chariot is indeed a thunderbolt, and the sacrificer is Indra: therefore he says, 'Thou art Indra's thunderbolt;'--'a winner of wealth,' for the chariot is indeed a winner of wealth;--'May this one win wealth by thee!'--wealth means food: 'may this one gain food by thee,' is what he thereby says.
1	4	4	That chariot, seized by the pole, he turns (from left to right) so as to make it stand inside the vedi , with, 'In the winning of wealth, the great Mother'--wealth means food: 'in the winning of food, the great Mother'--is what he thereby says;--'Aditi by name, we praise with speech;' now Aditi is this earth: therefore he says, 'Aditi by name, we praise with speech,'--'whereon all this being hath settled;' for indeed thereon all being here is settled;--'thereon may the divine Savitri prosper our stay!' whereby he means to say, 'thereon may the divine Savitri prosper our Sacrificer!'
1	4	5	He then sprinkles the horses with water, either when being led down to be watered, or when broughtup after being watered. Now in the beginning the horse was produced from the water; while being produced from the water, it was produced incomplete, for it was indeed produced incomplete: hence it does not stand on all its feet, but it stands lifting one foot on each side. Thus what then was left behind of it in the water, therewith he now completes it, and makes it whole: therefore he sprinkles the horses with water, either when being led down to be watered, or when brought up after being watered.
1	4	6	He sprinkles them, with , 'Within the waters is ambrosia, in the waters is medicine: at the praises of the waters may ye wax strong, ye horses!' And with this also, 'O divine waters, what rushing, high-peaked, wealth-winning wave ye have, therewith may this one win wealth!' wealth is food: he thus says, 'May he thereby gain food!'
1	4	7	He then yokes (the team of) the chariot. The right horse he yokes (puts to) first; for in human (practice) they indeed put to the left horse first, but with the gods in this way.
1	4	8	He yokes it, with , Either the wind, or thought--'for there is nothing swifter than the wind, and nothing swifter than thought:' therefore he says, 'Either the wind, or thought;--'(or) the seven and twenty Gandharvas ,they yoked the horse at first;' for the Gandharvas indeed yoked the horse at first: 'May they who yoked the horse at first yoke thee!' this he thereby says they;--'laid speed into him,'--he thereby says, 'May they who laid speed into it, lay speed into thee!'
1	4	9	He then yokes the left horse, with , 'Become thou swift as the wind, O courser, being yoked!'--thereby he says, 'Become quick as the wind, O courser, being yoked;'--'be thou as Indra's right (steed) in beauty!'--he thereby says, 'Even as Indra's right (steed) for beauty, so be thou that of the sacrificer for beauty!'--'May the all-knowing Maruts yoke thee!' he thereby says, 'may gods yoke thee!'--'May Tvashtri lay speed into thy feet!' in this there is nothing obscure. He then yokes the right side-horse; for in human (practice) they indeed yoke the left side-horse first, but with the gods in this way.
1	4	10	He yokes it, with , 'What speed hath been secretly laid into thee, O courser, and what (speed), bestowed on the eagle, went along in the wind;'--he thereby says, 'what speed of thine, O courser, is hidden away even elsewhere, therewith win this our sacrifice, Pragâpati!'--'with that strength be thou strong and wealth-winning for us, O courser, and victorious at the gathering!'--wealth means food: he thus means to say, 'And be thou a food-winner for us at this oursacrifice, at the gathering of the gods win thou this sacrifice, Pragâpati!'
1	4	11	Now only those three (horses) are yoked, for what is threefold belongs to the gods, and this (sacrifice is) with the gods. Alongside the yoke (laid) on the side-horse  goes a fourth (horse), for that one is human. When he is about to give that (chariot to the Adhvaryu), he gives it after yoking the fourth (horse) thereto. Hence also at any other sacrifice only those three (horses) are yoked; for what is threefold belongs to the gods, and this (sacrifice is) with the gods. Alongside the yoke of the side-horse goes a fourth (horse), for that one is human. When he is about to give that (chariot) away, he gives it after yoking the fourth (horse) thereto.
1	4	12	He now takes out material for a wild-rice pap of seventeen plates for Brihaspati; for he who offers the Vâgapeya wins food,--vâga-peya being doubtless the same as anna-peya (food and drink): thus whatever food he has thereby won, that he now prepares for him.
1	4	13	And as to why it belongs to Brihaspati:--Brihaspati won it in the beginning, therefore it belongs to Brihaspati.
1	4	14	And why it is prepared of wild rice:--Brihaspati is the Brahman (priesthood), and those wild-rice grains are cooked with the Brahman (prayer),--therefore it is of wild rice. It is one of seventeen plates,because Pragâpati is seventeenfold: he thus wins Pragâpati.
1	4	15	He makes the horses smell it, with 'Ye coursers--;' for horses are coursers (vâgin): therefore he says, 'Ye coursers,'--'wealth-winners,'--wealth is food: 'food-winners' he thereby says;--'starting upon the course;' for they are about to run a race;--'smell ye Brihaspati's portion!' for this indeed is Brihaspati's portion: therefore he says, 'smell ye Brihaspati's portion!' And why he makes the horses smell it: he thinks, 'may I win Him !' therefore he makes the horses smell it.
1	5	1	Now when they run a race, he thereby wins this same (terrestrial) world. And when the Brahman sings a Sâman on the cart-wheel set up on (a post) reaching to his navel, he thereby wins the air-world. And when he erects the sacrificial post, he thereby wins the world of the gods. Hence that threefold performance.
1	5	2	The Brahman mounts a cart-wheel, set up on (a post) as high as his navel , with , 'At the impulse (sava) of the god Savitri, of true impulsion, may I ascend unto the highest heaven of Brihaspati!' thus, if a Brâhmana sacrifices; for Brihaspati is the Brahman (priesthood, or sanctity), and the Brâhmana is the Brahman.
1	5	3	And if a Râganya sacrifices, (he does so) with, 'At the impulse of the divine Savitri, of true impulsion, may I ascend unto the highest heaven of Indra!' for Indra is the Kshatra (nobility, or power), and the Râganya is the Kshatra.
1	5	4	Thrice he sings the Sâman . Having thrice sung it, he descends with, 'At the impulse of the divine Savitri, of true impulsion, I have ascended unto the highest heaven of Brihaspati!'--thus, if a Brâhmana sacrifices, for Brihaspati is the Brahman, and the Brâhmana is the Brahman.
1	5	5	And if a Râganya sacrifices,--with, 'At the impulse of the divine Savitri, of true impulsion, I have ascended unto the highest heaven of Indra!' for Indra is the Kshatra, and the Râganya is the Kshatra.
1	5	6	They put up seventeen drums along the edge of the altar, from the Âgnîdhra backwards (towardsthe west); for he who offers the Vâgapeya wins Pragâpati; but Pragâpati is speech, and that doubtless is the supreme speech which is (the outcome) of seventeen drums: he thus wins the supreme speech, the supreme Pragâpati. Seventeen there are, because Pragâpati is seventeenfold: he thus wins Pragâpati.
1	5	7	One of these drums he (the Brahman) beats (while praying) with a sacrificial formula: thereby all of them become beaten with a sacrificial formula.
1	5	8	He beats it with , 'O Brihaspati, win the race! lift ye up your voice unto Brihaspati: make ye Brihaspati win the race!' thus, if a Brâhmana sacrifices; for Brihaspati is the Brahman, and the Brâhmana is the Brahman.
1	5	9	And if a Râganya sacrifices, (he does so) with, 'O Indra, win the race! lift ye up your voice unto Indra: make ye Indra win the race!' for Indra is the Kshatra, and the Râganya is the Kshatra.
1	5	10	And when those race-running chariots  have come up again, he takes down one of those drums with a sacrificial formula; whereby they all become taken down with a formula.
1	5	11	He takes it down, with , 'This hath been your true concord whereby ye (drums) have caused Brihaspati to win the race;--Brihaspati ye have caused to win the race: be released, ye wood-lords!' thus, if a Brâhmanasacrifices; for Brihaspati is the Brahman, and the Brâhmana is the Brahman.
1	5	12	And if a Râganya sacrifices, with, 'This hath been your true concord whereby ye have caused Indra to twin the race;--Indra ye have caused to win the race: be released, ye wood-lords!' for Indra is the Kshatra, and the Râganya is the Kshatra.
1	5	13	A Râganya then  shoots seventeen arrow's ranges northwards from the edge of the altar; for as much as is one arrow's range, so much is Pragâpati crosswise; and as much as are seventeen arrow's ranges, so much is Pragâpati lengthwise.
1	5	14	And as to why a Râganya shoots,--he, the Râganya is most manifestly of Pragâpati (the lord of creatures): hence, while being one, he rules over many; and because 'pragâpati' has four syllables, and 'râganya ' also has four syllables, therefore a Râganya shoots. He shoots seventeen arrow's ranges, because Pragâpati is seventeenfold: he thereby wins Pragâpati.
1	5	15	And whichever (horse) he yokes with a formula, up to that the Sacrificer now steps , with , 'At the impulse of the divine Savitri,of true impulsion, may I win the race of the race-winning Brihaspati!'
1	5	16	And even as then Brihaspati hasted up to Savitri for his impulsion,--Savitri being the impeller among the gods--saying, 'Impel this for me: impelled by thee, may I win this!' and Savitri, as the impeller, impelled it for him, and impelled by Savitri, he won; in like manner does he thereby haste up to Savitri for his impulsion,--Savitri being the impeller among the gods,--saying, 'Impel this for me: impelled by thee, may I win!' and Savitri, as the impeller, impels it for him, and impelled by Savitri he wins.
1	5	17	And if a pupil of the Adhvaryu's or some (other) theological student were to know that prayer, stepping up he makes (the Sacrificer) say, 'O coursers!'--for horses are indeed coursers: therefore he says, 'O coursers'--'wealth-winners!' for wealth is food: 'food-winners' he thereby says;--'keeping the roads,' for they indeed run keeping (within) the roads;--'measuring the stages;' for measuring the stages they run over the course;--'go ye to the winning-post!' In order that the evil-doers, the Rakshas, may not hurt them midways, he thus says this.--They run the race, they beat the drums, and he (the Brahman) sings the Sâman.
1	5	18	He (the Adhvaryu) then  either offers or addresses (the horses) with those two gagatî-verses: whether he offers, or whether he addresses (thehorses), the significance (of the performance) is the same.
1	5	19	He offers, with , 'That courser speedeth after the whip, fettered at the neck and shoulder and mouth: may Dadhikrâ win according to his power; may he run along the windings of the roads, hail!'
1	5	20	, 'And of him, the running, speeding, there fanneth like the wing of the eager bird,--as of the gliding eagle,--about the breast of Dadhikrâvan passing along with might, hail!'
1	5	21	He then either offers or addresses (the horses) with the following tristich: this is twofold, because he either offers or addresses. Whether he offers, or addresses (the horses), the significance is the same: he thereby speeds those running horses, imbues them with energy. There are here three earths, namely this one, and two beyond it: these he thereby wins.
1	5	22	He addresses , 'Auspicious be the coursers unto us at the invocations in the divine service, running their measured course, with beautiful song; swallowing the dragon, the wolf, the evil spirits: may they ever keep away from us affliction!'
1	5	23	, 'Those racers, wont to hear the calls, may they all hear our call, the coursers running their measured course: they, the winners of thousands, eager to win at the winning of oblations, who have carried off great gain in the contests.'
1	5	24	, 'Inevery race, help us, ye racers, at the prizes, ye wise, immortal knowers of the divine law: drink of this mead, be gladdened, and satisfied walk ye on the paths trodden by the gods!'
1	5	25	He then  steps over against (the horses) with the Bârhaspatya pap, and touches it; for he who offers the Vâgapeya wins food, since 'vâga-peya' is the same as 'anna-peya:' whatever food he has thus gained that he now, having reached that goal, brings in contact with himself, puts within himself.
1	5	26	He touches it, with , 'May gain of wealth come to me!' wealth means food: he thus says, 'May gain of food come (accrue) to me;'--'May these two, Heaven and Earth, the all-shaped, come to me!' for Pragâpati is Heaven and Earth;--'May father and mother come to me!' for Pragâpati is both father and mother;--'May Soma come to me with immortality!' for Pragâpati is Soma.
1	5	27	He makes the horses smell it, with, 'Ye coursers!' for horses are coursers: therefore he says, 'Ye coursers! wealth-winners!' wealth is food: 'food-winners' he thereby says;--'having run the course--' for 'starting (upon the course)' he said before, as then they were indeed starting; but now he says, 'having run,' for they indeed have run (the race): therefore he says, 'having run;'--'smell ye Brihaspati's portion--' for this is Brihaspati's portion: therefore he says, 'Smell ye Brihaspati's portion;'--'taking (it) in!' whereby. he imbues the Sacrificer with energy. And as to whyhe makes the horses smell,--he made them smell before, thinking, 'May I win this (world);' and now (he does so) thinking, 'I have won this (world) that is why he makes the horses smell.
1	5	28	Now on one of those race-running (rival) chariots there has been standing either a Vaisya, or a Râganya; he now sits down on the northern hip of the altar. Thereupon the Adhvaryu and Sacrificer, taking the honey-cup, step out by the front, door (of the cart-shed), and place it in the Vaisya's, or Râganya's, hand. And the Neshtri, taking the cups of Surâ, steps out by the back door. He walks round by the back of the hall, and placing one (of the cups) in the Vaisya's, or Râganya's, hand, he says, 'With this I buy Him of thee!' For the Soma is truth, prosperity, light; and the Surâ is untruth, misery, darkness: he thus imbues the Sacrificer with truth, prosperity, and light; and smites the Vaisya with untruth, misery, and darkness;--whatever benefit (or enjoyment) he desires, he obtains for himself by those (cups of Surâ). But that cup of honey he presents to the Brahman, together with the golden vessel. In presenting it to the Brahman, he imbues himself with immortal life; for gold is immortal life;--and whatsoever benefit he desires that he thereby obtains for himself.
2	1	1	Thereupon, taking the clipping-spoon (sruva) and the pot for melting butter, he goes to the Âhavanîya fire. He either offers those twelve âptis , or makes (the Sacrificer) pronounce (theformulas). Whether he offers, or makes him pronounce (the formulas), the significance is the same.
2	1	2	He offers, with , 'To the ally, hail!--To the good ally, hail!--To the after-born, hail!--To the purpose, hail!--To the Vasu, hail!--To the Lord of day, hail!--To the failing day, hail!--To the failing one, sprung from the evanescent, hail!--To the evanescent one, sprung from the terminal, hail!--To the terminal descendant of being, hail!--To the Lord of being, hail!--To the over-lord, hail!' These twelve âptis (obtainments) he offers, because there are twelve months in the year, and Pragâpati is the year, and the sacrifice is Pragâpati: hence whatever obtainment, whatever accomplishment there is for him , that he thereby wins, that he makes his own.
2	1	3	He then either offers six kliptis , or makes (the Sacrificer) pronounce them. Whether he offers, or makes him pronounce them, the significance is the same.
2	1	4	He makes him pronounce , 'May the life prosper through sacrifice!--May the breath prosper through sacrifice!--May the eye prosper through sacrifice!--May the ear prosper through sacrifice!--May the back prosper through sacrifice!--May the sacrificeprosper through sacrifice!' These six kliptis he makes him pronounce, because there are six seasons in the year, and Pragâpati is the year, and the sacrifice is Pragâpati: thus whatever success, whatever accomplishment there is for him, that he thereby wins, that he makes his own.
2	1	5	The sacrificial post is eight-cornered; for the Gâyatrî metre has eight syllables, and the Gâyatrî is Agni's metre: he thereby wins the world of the gods. The post is either wrapt up, or bound up, in seventeen cloths; for Pragâpati is seventeenfold: he thus wins Pragâpati.
2	1	6	There is a wheaten head-piece  on it; for man is nearest to Pragâpati, and he is skinless . And among plants wheat comes nearest to man, (for) it has no skin: thus he thereby wins the world of men.
2	1	7	The post has a hollow (at the top), and is not pointed at the end; for the hollow is sacred to the Fathers: he thus gains the world of the Fathers. It is seventeen cubits long, for Pragâpati is seventeen-fold: he thus wins Pragâpati.
2	1	8	Thereupon the Neshtri, being about to lead up the (Sacrificer's) wife, makes her wrap round herself, over the garment of consecration, a cloth, or skirt, made of Kusa grass ; for she, the wife, is the hindpart of the sacrifice ; and he wishes her, thus coming forward, to propitiate the sacrifice. But impure is that part of woman which is below the navel, and pure are the plants of (Kusa) grass: thus having, by means of those plants of (Kusa) grass, made pure whatever part of her is impure, he causes her to propitiate the sacrifice, while coming forward. This is why the Neshtri, being about to lead up the wife, makes her wrap round herself, over the garment of consecration, a cloth, or skirt, made of Kusa grass.
2	1	9	He then leans a ladder (against the post). He may ascend either from the south northwards, or from the north southwards; but let him rather ascend from the south northwards (udak), for thus it goes upwards (udak).
2	1	10	Being about to ascend, he (the Sacrificer) addresses his wife, 'Come, wife, ascend we the sky!'--'Ascend we!' says the wife. Now as to why he addresses his wife: she, the wife, in sooth is one half of his own self; hence, as long as he does not obtain her, so long he is not regenerated, for so long he is incomplete. But as soon as he obtains her he is regenerated, for then he is complete. 'Complete I want to go to that supreme goal,' thus (he thinks) and therefore he addresses his wife.
2	1	11	He ascends, with, 'We have become Pragâpati's children;' for he who offers the Vâgapeya indeed becomes Pragâpati's child:
2	1	12	He then touches the wheat (top-piece) , with, 'We have gone to the light, O ye gods!' for he who offers the Vâgapeya, indeed goes to the light.
2	1	13	And as to why he touches the wheat: wheat is food, and he who offers the Vâgapeya, wins food, for vâga-peya is the same as anna-peya (food and drink): thus whatever food he has thereby won, therewith now that he has gone to that supreme goal, he puts himself in contact, and possesses himself of it,--therefore he touches the wheat (top-piece).
2	1	14	He then rises by (the measure of) his head over the post, with, 'We have become immortal!' whereby he wins the world of the gods.
2	1	15	Thereupon, while looking in the different directions, he mutters , 'Ours be your power, ours your manhood and intelligence ours be your energies!' For he who offers the Vâgapeya wins everything here, winning as he does Pragâpati, and Pragâpati being everything here;--having appropriated to himself the glory, the power, and the strength of this All, he now lays them within himself, makes them his own: that is why he mutters, while looking in the different directions.
2	1	16	They throw up to him bags of salt; for salt means cattle, and cattle is food; and he who offers the  wins food, for vâga-peya is the same as anna-peya: thus whatever food he thereby has gained, therewith now that he has gone to the supreme goal, he puts himself in contact, and makes it his own,--therefore they throw bags of salt up to him.
2	1	17	They (the pieces of salt) are done up in asvattha (ficus religiosa) leaves: because Indra on that (former) occasion called upon the Maruts staying on the Asvattha tree , therefore they are done up in asvattha leaves. Peasants (vis) throw them up to him, for the Maruts are the peasants, and the peasants are food (for the nobleman): hence peasants throw them up. There are seventeen (bags), for Pragâpati is seventeenfold: he thus wins Pragâpati.
2	1	18	Thereupon; while looking down upon this (earth), he mutters, Homage be to the mother Earth! homage be to the mother Earth!' For when Brihaspati had been consecrated, the Earth was afraid of him, thinking, 'Something great surely has he become now that he has been consecrated: I fear lest he may rend me asunder !' And Brihaspati also was afraid of the Earth, thinking, 'I fear lest she may shake me off!' Hence by that (formula) he entered into a friendly relation with her; for a mother does not hurt her son, nor does a son hurt his mother.
2	1	19	Now the   is the same as the Vâgapeya; and the earth in truth is afraid of that (Sacrificer), thinking, 'Something greatsurely has he become now that he has been consecrated: I fear lest he may rend me asunder!' And he himself is afraid of her, thinking, 'I fear lest she may shake me off!' Hence he thereby enters into a friendly relation with her, for a mother does not hurt her son; neither does a son hurt his mother.
2	1	20	He then descends (and treads) upon a piece of gold;--gold is immortal life: he thus takes his stand on life immortal.
2	1	21	Now (in the first place) he (the Adhvaryu) spreads out the skin of a he-goat, and lays a (small) gold plate thereon: upon that--or indeed upon this (earth) itself--he (the Sacrificer) steps.
2	1	22	They then bring a throne-seat for him; for truly he who gains a seat in the air , gains a seat above (others): thus these subjects of his sit below him who is seated above,--this is why they bring him a throne-seat.
2	1	23	It is made of udumbara wood,--the Udumbara tree being sustenance, (that is) food,--for his obtainment of sustenance, food: therefore it is made of udumbara wood. They set it down in front of the Havirdhâna (cart-shed), behind the Âhavanîya (fire).
2	1	24	He then spreads the goat-skin thereon; for truly the he-goat is no other than Pragâpati, for they, the goats, are most clearly of Pragâpati (the lord of generation or creatures);--whence, bringing forth thrice in a year, they produce two or three : thus he thereby makes him (the Sacrificer) to be Pragâpati himself,--this is why he spreads the goat-skin thereon.
2	1	25	He spreads it, with, 'This is thy kingship !' whereby he endows him with royal power. He then makes him sit down, with, Thou art the ruler, the ruling lord!' whereby he makes him the ruler, ruling over those subjects of his Thou art firm, and stedfast!' whereby he makes him firm and stedfast in this world;--'Thee for the tilling!--Thee for peaceful dwelling!--Thee for wealth!--Thee for thrift!' whereby he means to say, '(here I seat) thee for the welfare (of the people).'
2	2	1	He now proceeds with the Bârhaspatya pap. Its svishtakrit remains yet unoffered, when he (the Adhvaryu) brings  him (the Sacrificer) some food; for he who offers the Vâgapeya wins food, vâgapeya being the same as anna-peya: thus whatever food he (the Sacrificer) has thereby gained, that he (the Adhvaryu) now brings to him.
2	2	2	In a vessel of udumbara wood--the Udumbara tree being sustenance, (that is) food--for the obtainment of sustenance, food: therefore it is in a vessel of udumbara wood. He first brings water, then milk, then (other) kinds of food, as they occur to him.
2	2	3	Now some bring seventeen kinds of food,saying, 'Seventeenfold is Pragâpati.' But let him not do so: surely all the food is not appropriated to Pragâpati , and, compared to him, what is man that he should appropriate to himself all food? Hence, while bringing every kind of food that occurs to him, let him not bring of some one (particular) kind of food.
2	2	4	And whatever food he does trot bring to him, let him (the Sacrificer) forswear  that, and not eat of it as long as he lives: thus he does not go to the end, thus he lives long. Of all that food brought together he offers the (seven) Vâga-prasavanîya  oblations, cutting out (pieces) with the dipping-spoon. Thus to whatever deities he is now offering, they give an impulse to him, and impelled by them hewins: therefore he offers the Vâgaprasavanîya oblations.
2	2	5	He offers with , 'The impulse of strength impelled of old that king Soma in the plants, in the waters: may they be rich in honey for us! may we be wakeful in the kingdom, placed in the front, hail!'
2	2	6	'The impulse of strength spread over this sky, and over all these worlds, as the all-ruler; knowing he causeth him to give gifts who wisheth not to give: may he bestow upon us wealth with the full muster of heroes, hail!'
2	2	7	'Yea, the impulse of strength prevailed over all these worlds, on every side; from days of yore the king goeth about knowing, increasing the people, and the well-being amongst us, hail!'
2	2	8	'To king Soma, to Agni we cling  for help, to the Âdityas, to Vishnu, to Sûrya, to the Brahman Brihaspati, hail!'
2	2	9	'Urge thou Aryaman, Brihaspati, Indra to the giving of gifts, Vâk , Vishnu, Sarasvatî, and the vigorous Savitri, hail!'
2	2	10	'O Agni, speak to us here, be thou gracious unto us! bestow blessings upon us, O winner of thousands, for thou art the giver of wealth, hail!'
2	2	11	'May Aryaman bestow blessings upon us, and Pûshan, and Brihaspati! may the divine Vâk give us gifts, hail!'
2	2	12	With the remaining (offering material) he sprinkles him (the Sacrificer); he thereby sprinkleshim with food, bestows food upon him: for this reason he sprinkles him with the remaining (material) .
2	2	13	He sprinkles with , 'At the impulse of the divine Savitri, (I sprinkle) thee, by the arms of the Asvins, by the hands of Pûshan!' he thus sprinkles (consecrates) him by the hands of gods;--'I place thee in the leading of Sarasvatî Vâk, the leader;' for Sarasvatî is Vâk (speech): he thus places him in the leading of Vâk, the leader.
2	2	14	Here now some say, 'I place thee in the leading of the leader of all the gods;' for all the gods are the All: he thus places him in the leading of the leader of the All. But let him not say so; let him rather say, 'I place thee in the leading of Sarasvatî Vâk;' for Sarasvatî is Vâk: he thus places him in the leading of Vâk.--'I consecrate thee, N.N., with the supreme rulership of Brihaspati!' therewith he mentions the (Sacrificer's) name: he thus makes him attain to the fellowship of Brihaspati, and to co-existence in his world.
2	2	15	He then says,' All-ruler is he, N.N.! All-ruler is he, N.N.!' Him, thus indicated, he thereby indicates to the gods: 'Of mighty power is he who has been consecrated; he has become one of yours; protect him!' thus he thereby says. Thrice he says it, for threefold is the sacrifice.
2	2	16	He then either offers, or makes him pronounce (the formulas of) the Uggiti oblations . Whether he offers or makes him pronounce (the formulas), the significance is the same.
2	2	17	He makes him say , 'With the (word of) one syllable Agni won the breath: may I win that!-- --  With the (metre of) seventeen syllables Pragâpati won the seventeenfold stoma: may I win that!' whatever those deities won by means of those (formulas), that he now wins by them. There are seventeen (formulas), for Pragâpati is seventeenfold: he thus wins Pragâpati.
2	2	18	Thereupon he says, 'Recite (the invitatory formula) to Agni Svishtakrit!' Now, as to why this rite is performed between two oblations. Pragâpati, truly, is that sacrifice which is here performed, and from which these creatures have been produced,--and, indeed, they are even now produced after this one: he thus wins Pragâpati in the very middle: therefore that rite is performed between two oblations. Having made (the Âgnîdhra) utter the Sraushat, he says, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to Agni Svishtakrit!' and offers as the Vashat is uttered.
2	2	19	He then puts the Idâ on (the idâpâtrî). The Idâ having been invoked , he, having touched water, draws the Mâhendra cup. Having drawn the Mâhendra cup, he sets the chant agoing . He urges him (the Sacrificer) forward to the chant: he gets down (from the throne-seat); he is in attendance at the Stotra, in attendance at the Sastra.
2	2	20	Here now some, having performed that, perform that ; but let him not do it thus; for the Stotra is his (the Sacrificer's) own self, and the Sastra is his people (or ): thereby then he ruins the Sacrificer; he goes astray, he stumbles;--hence having performed that, let him perform that:--
2	2	21	He puts the Idâ on (the dish). The Idâ having been invoked, he, having touched water, draws the Mâhendra cup. Having drawn the Mâhendra cup, he sets the (Prishtha-) Stotra agoing. He urges him (the Sacrificer) forward to the chant: he gets down (from the throne-seat); he is in attendance at the chant (stotra), in attendance at the recitation (sastra).
2	3	1	He offers a full-offering ; for the full means the All: 'May I be consecrated after encompassing the All!' thus he thinks. At this (offering) he bestows a boon; for a boon means all: 'Having encompassed the All (the universe), may I be consecrated! thus he thinks. He may perform this offering, if he chooses; or, if he chooses, he may disregard it.
2	3	2	And on the following day he prepares a cake on eight potsherds, as sacrificial food for Anumati . And whatever portion of (the grains) being ground,--either flour or rice-grains,--falls down behind the pin, that he throws together into the dipping-spoon (sruva) . They take a firebrand from the Anvâhâryapakana (or southern) fire, and therewith go southward. And where he finds a self-produced hollow  or cleft,--
2	3	3	Having there made up a fire, he offers with , 'This, O Nirriti, is thy portion: accept it graciously, hail!' For Nirriti is this (Earth); whomsoever she seizes upon with evil, him she seizes upon with destruction (nirriti): hence whatever part of this (Earth) is of the Nirriti nature, that he thereby propitiates; and thus Nirriti does not seize upon him, while being consecrated. And the reason why he offers in a self-produced hollow orcleft, is that that much of this (earth) is possessed with Nirriti.
2	3	4	They then return (to the sacrificial ground) without looking backward. He now proceeds with the cake on eight potsherds for Anumati. For Anumati is this (Earth); and whosoever knows to do that work which he intends to do, for him indeed she approves (arm-man) thereof: hence it is her he thereby pleases, thinking 'May I be consecrated, approved by that (genius of) approval!'
2	3	5	And as to why it is a (cake) on eight potsherds,--the Gâyatrî consists of eight syllables, and this earth is Gâyatrî. And as to why he offers of the same sacrificial food  both (oblations): thereby, indeed, both of it comes to be this latter one (viz. Anumati, or approval). A garment is the sacrificial fee for this (offering): for even as one clad in a garment does not venture into the forest, but having deposited that garment (somewhere) escapes (robbers), in like manner no assault befalls him while being consecrated.
2	3	6	And on the following day he prepares a cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Vishnu, and offers it in the same way as the (regular) ishti: this indeed is just what that approved initiation-offering to Agni and Vishnu is there . Now Agni is all the deities, since in Agni one offers to all deities; and Agni forsooth is the lower end, and Vishnu is the upper end: 'May I be consecrated, after thus encompassing all the deities, and after encompassingthe whole sacrifice!' thus he thinks, and hence there is a cake on eleven potsherds to Agni and Vishnu. Gold is the sacrificial fee for this (offering); for to Agni belongs this sacrifice, and gold is Agni's seed. As to Vishnu, he is the sacrifice, and Agni forsooth is the sacrifice: nevertheless this is Agni's alone, therefore gold is the fee.
2	3	7	And on the following day he prepares a cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Soma, and offers it in the same way as an (ordinary) ishti, for it was thereby Indra slew Vritra, and thereby he gained that universal conquest which now is his. And in like manner does this (king, the Sacrificer) thereby slay his wicked, hateful enemy, and in like manner does he gain the victory. 'May I be consecrated, when safety and security from evil-doers have been gained!' thus. he thinks: hence there is a cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Soma. For this (offering) a bull set at liberty is the sacrificial fee; for yonder moon  they slay while setting him at liberty : to wit, by the full-moon offering they slay him, and by the new-moon offering they set him at liberty;--therefore a bull set at liberty is the fee.
2	3	8	And on the following day he prepares a cake on twelve potsherds for Indra and Agni, and offers it in the same way as an (ordinary) ishti. Now when Indra slew Vritra, that vigour and energy of his went out of him, being frightened: by this offering he again possessed himself of that vigour and energy. And in like manner does this (Sacrificer) by this offering possess himself of vigour and energy; for Agni is fiery spirit, and Indra is vigour and energy: 'May I be consecrated, having embraced both these energies!' thus he thinks: hence there is a cake on twelve potsherds for Indra and Agni. A bull is the fee for this (offering), for by his shoulder he is of Agni's nature , and by his testicles he is of Indra's nature: therefore a bull is the fee for it.
2	3	9	Thereupon he performs the offering of first-fruits ; for verily he who performs the Râgasûya secures for himself (the benefits of) all sacrificial rites, all ishtis, even the spoon-offerings; and instituted by the gods, in truth, is that ishti, the Âgrayaneshti: 'May this also be offered by me! May I be consecrated by this (offering) also!' thus he thinks, and therefore he performs the offering of first-fruits. Moreover, it is for the plants that he who is consecrated, is consecrated; therefore he now makes the plants healthy and faultless, thinking, 'May I be consecrated for (the obtainment of) healthy, faultless plants (crops)!' A cow is the fee for this (offering).
2	3	10	Thereupon he performs the Seasonal offerings ; for verily he who performs the Râgasûya secures for himself (the benefits of) all sacrificialrites, all ishtis, even the spoon-offerings; and instituted by the gods, in truth, is that sacrificial rite, the Seasonal offerings: 'May these also be offered by me! May I be consecrated by these (offerings) also!' thus he thinks, and therefore he performs the Seasonal offerings.
2	4	1	He offers the Vaisvadeva  (All-gods’ offering); for by means of the Vaisvadeva, Pragâpati created abundance (of food) and creatures, thinking, 'May I be consecrated, after creating abundance and creatures!' And in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now, by the Vaisvadeva, create abundance and creatures, thinking, 'May I be consecrated, after creating abundance and creatures!'
2	4	2	He then offers the Varunapraghâsâh ; for by means of the Varunapraghâsâh Pragâpati delivered the creatures from Varuna's noose, and those creatures of his were produced healthy and faultless: 'May I be consecrated for healthy, faultless creatures!'he thought. And in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now, by the Varunapraghâsâh, deliver the creatures from Varuna's noose, and those creatures of his are produced healthy and faultless: 'May I be consecrated for healthy, faultless creatures!' so he thinks.
2	4	3	He then performs the Sâkamedhâh ; for by the Sâkamedhâh the gods slew Vritra, and gained that universal conquest which now is theirs. And in, like manner does this (Sacrificer) thereby now slay his wicked, hateful enemy; and in like manner does he gain the victory, thinking, 'May I be consecrated, when safety and security are gained!'
2	4	4	He then performs the Sunâsîrya , thinking, 'May I be consecrated, having encompassed both essences! Thereupon the Pañkavâtîya  (oblation to the five winds). Having poked the Âhavanîya fire asunder into five parts, he offers, cutting out butter with the dipping-spoon.
2	4	5	He offers in the forepart (of the fire), with , 'To the Agni-eyed gods, the east-seated, hail!' He then offers in the southern partwith, 'To the Yama-eyed  gods, the south-seated, hail!' He then offers in the hind part with, 'To the Visvadeva-eyed gods, the west-seated, hail!' He then offers in the northern part with either, 'To the Mitrâvaruna-eyed gods,--or, To the Marut-eyed gods,--the north-seated, hail!' He then offers in the centre with, 'To the Soma-eyed gods, the above-seated; the venerable, hail!'
2	4	6	Having then poked (the fire) together, he offers with , 'The gods that are Agni-eyed, east-seated, to them hail!--The gods that are Yama-eyed, south-seated, to them hail!--The gods that are Visvadeva-eyed, west-seated, to them hail!--The gods that are Mitrâvaruna-eyed--or, Marut-eyed--north-seated, to them hail!--The gods that are Soma-eyed, above-seated, venerable, to them hail!' Now as to why he thus offers.
2	4	7	Now when, by means of the Sâkamedhâh, the gods were gaining that universal conquest, which now is theirs, they said, 'Verily the fiends, the Rakshas, suck out these (creatures) in the (four) quarters: come, let us throw the thunderbolt at them!' Now the ghee is a thunderbolt: with that thunderbolt, the ghee, they smote the fiends, the Rakshas, in the (four) quarters, and gained that universal conquest which now is theirs. And in like manner does this (Sacrificer) smite the fiends, the Rakshas, in the quarters, by that thunderbolt, the ghee; and thus he gains the victory, thinking, 'May I be consecrated, when safety and security have been gained!'
2	4	8	And as to why he offers those five latter oblations. Now when they poke the Âhavanîya asunder into five parts, thereby they wound and tear some of the fire; and hereby now he heals it: therefore he offers those five latter oblations.
2	4	9	For this (offering) a carriage and pair, with a side horse, is the priest's fee. Three horses, the warrior, and the charioteer,--these are five breaths, and the breath is the same as the wind: and because that is the fee for this sacrifice, therefore it is called Pañkavâtîya (belonging to the five winds).
2	4	10	He may also heal (some disease ) with this (offering): For yonder blower (or purifier, the wind) is this breath; and the breath is the same as the vital energy. Now he (the wind) blows as one only, but on entering into man, he is divided tenfold; and ten are those oblations he offers: thus he (the priest) endows him with the ten vital airs, with the whole, entire vital energy; and were he now even as one whose vital spirit has departed, verily by this (offering) he (the priest) brings him round again.
2	4	11	Thereupon the Indraturîya .--There is a cake on eight potsherds for Agni, a barley pap for Varuna, a pap of gavedhukâ seed (coix barbata) for Rudra; and a mess of sour curds from a yoke-trainedcow for Indra: this Indraturîya he offers. Now Indra and Agni on that occasion consulted with each other: 'Verily the fiends, the Rakshas, suck out these (creatures) in the (four) quarters: come, let us throw the thunderbolt at them!'
2	4	12	Agni then spake, 'Let there be three shares for me, one for thee!'--'So be it!'--By that offering those two smote the fiends, the Rakshas, in the (four) quarters, and gained that universal conquest which now is theirs. And in like manner does this (Sacrificer) by that offering smite the fiends, the Rakshas, in the quarters; and gain the victory, thinking, 'May I be consecrated, when safety and security have been gained!'
2	4	13	Now what cake on eight potsherds there is for Agni, that is one of Agni's shares; and what barley pap there is for Varuna--Varuna being the same as Agni--that is Agni's second share; and what pap of gavedhukâ seed there is for Rudra--Rudra being the same as Agni--that is Agni's third share. And as to why it is prepared of gavedhukâ seed: that god surely is (the recipient) of refuse (remains of offering) , and gavedhukâ grass is refuse,--hence it is prepared of gavedhukâ seed. And what mess of sour curds there is from a yoke-trained cow for Indra, that is the fourth share (being that) of Indra--turîya being the same as katurtha (fourth)--hence the name Indraturîya. That same yoke-trained cow is the fee for this (offering); for by her shoulder she is of Agni's nature, since her shoulder is, as it were, fire-burnt; and in that, being a female, she improperly draws (the cart), that is her Varunicnature; and in that she is a cow, she is of Rudra's nature ; and in that Indra's sour curds (come) from her, thereby she is of Indra's nature. Indeed that (cow) commands all that: therefore that same yoke-trained cow is the fee.
2	4	14	Thereupon he performs the Apâmârgahoma; for by means of apâmârga plants (achyranthes aspera) the gods wiped away (apa-marg) the fiends, the Rakshas, in the quarters, and gained that universal conquest which now is theirs. And in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now by means of apâmârga plants wipe away the fiends, the Rakshas, in the quarters; and in like manner does he gain the victory, thinking, 'May I be consecrated, when safety and security have been gained!'
2	4	15	He takes apâmârga grains in a dipping-spoon of either palâsa (butea frondosa) or vikaṅkata (flacourtia sapida) wood. They take a firebrand from the Anvâhâryapakana (southern) fire; and proceed therewith eastward or northward; and there having made up a fire he offers.
2	4	16	He takes the firebrand with , 'Encounter the arrays, Agni!'--arrays means battles: 'encounter the battles!' he thereby says;--'Repel the evil-wisher!'--the evil-wisher is the enemy: 'beat off the enemy!' he thereby says;--'Unconquerable, conquering the evil-doers!'--unconquerable he is indeed, by the Rakshas, the fiends; and conquering the evil-doers, for he conquers every evil:therefore he says, 'conquering the evil-doers;'--'Bestow glory upon the offerer of sacrifice!'--'bestowing blessing on the Sacrificer,' is what he thereby says.
2	4	17	Thereupon making up the fire he offers with , 'At the impulse of the God Savitri I offer with the arms of the Asvins, with the hands of Pûshan, with the strength of the Upâmsu!' for the Upâmsu  (cup of Soma) is the mouth (or opening) of the sacrifice: thus he slays the fiends, the Rakshas, by the mouth of the sacrifice;--'Slain is the Rakshas, hail!' thus he slays the fiends, the Rakshas.
2	4	18	If the dipping-spoon is of palâsa wood,--the palâsa being the Brahman--it is with the Brahman that he slays the fiends, the Rakshas; and if it is of vikaṅkata wood,--the vikaṅkata being the thunderbolt--it is with the thunderbolt that the slays the fiends, the Rakshas: 'For the slaughter of the Rakshas (I take) thee!' therewith he slays the fiends, the Rakshas.
2	4	19	If he offers after going eastward, he throws the spoon towards the east; and if he offers after going northward, he throws the spoon towards the north, with, 'We have slain the Rakshas!' thus he slays the fiends, the Rakshas.
2	4	20	Thereupon they return (to the sacrificial ground) without looking back. Now by this (ceremony) also he may make for himself a counter-charm . In whatever direction from there (his evil-wisher) is,looking back thither he offers; for the Apâmârga is of a backward effect: whosoever does anything to him there, him indeed he thereby pitches backward. Let him indicate the name of that one, saying, 'We have slain so and so! So and so is slain!' thus he slays the fiends, the Rakshas.
2	5	1	He prepares a cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Vishnu, a pap for Indra and Vishnu, and either a cake on three potsherds, or a pap, for Vishnu. He performs that Trishamyukta  offering. Therewith the gods came by men, and in like manner does this (king) now thereby come by men.
2	5	2	Now as to why there is that cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Vishnu;--Agni is the giver, and men are Vishnu's: thus Agni, the giver, gives him (the king) men.
2	5	3	And as to why there is a pap for Indra and Vishnu;--Indra is the Sacrificer, and men are Vishnu's: thus Agni, the giver, gives him (the Sacrificer) men; he now puts himself in contact with them, makes them his own.
2	5	4	And as to why there is either a cake on three potsherds, or a pap, for Vishnu;--whatever men Agni, the giver, gives him, among them he thereby finally establishes him (the king); and whatever work he wishes to do with his men, that he is able to do. Thus he thereby approaches the men, thinking, 'May I be consecrated, and possessed of men!' A dwarfish bull is the sacrificial fee for this (offering), for the dwarf belongs to Vishnu .
2	5	5	He then performs another Trishamyukta offering. He prepares a cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Pûshan, a pap for Indra and Pûshan, and a pap for Pûshan: this Trishamyukta he offers. Thereby the gods obtained cattle; and in like manner does this (king) thereby obtain cattle.
2	5	6	Now as to why there is that cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Pûshan; Agni is the giver, and the cattle are Pûshan's: thus Agni, the giver, gives him cattle.
2	5	7	And as to why there is a pap for Indra and Pûshan;--Indra is the Sacrificer, and the cattle are Pûshan's: whatever cattle Agni, the giver, gives him, therewith he now puts himself in contact, those he makes his own.
2	5	8	And why there is a pap for Pûshan;--whatever cattle Agni, the giver, gives him, therewith he thereby finally establishes him, and whatever work he wishes to do with his cattle, that he is ableto do: thus he comes by cattle, thinking, 'May I be consecrated, possessed of cattle!' A dark-grey  bull is the fee for this (offering), for such a dark-grey one is of Pûshan's nature: there are two forms of the dark-grey, the white hair and the black; and 'two and two' means a productive pair, and Pûshan represents productiveness, for Pûshan is cattle, and cattle means productiveness: thus a productive pair is obtained,--hence a dark-grey bull is the sacrificial fee.
2	5	9	He then performs another Trishamyukta offering. He prepares a cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Soma, a pap for Indra and Soma, and a pap for Soma: this Trishamyukta (triply connected) he offers:--Thereby the gods attained glory; and in like manner does this (king) thereby attain glory.
2	5	10	Now as to why there is that cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Soma;--Agni is the giver, and Soma is glory: thus Agni, the giver, gives him glory.
2	5	11	And as to why there is a pap for Indra and Soma;--Indra is the Sacrificer, and Soma is glory: whatever glory Agni, the giver, gives him, therewith he now puts himself in contact, that he makes his own.
2	5	12	And why there is a pap for Soma;--whatever glory, Agni, the giver, gives him, therein he now finally establishes him; and whatever work he, the glorious, wishes to do, that he is able to do. Thus he thereby attains glory,--thinking, 'May I be consecrated, endowed with glory!' for the inglorious one has no concern with success. A brown bull isthe fee for this (offering); for such a brown one is of Soma's nature.
2	5	13	And on the following day he prepares a cake-on twelve potsherds for (Agni) Vaisvânara, and a barley pap for Varuna. These two offerings he performs either on days following one another, or so as to use the same barhis .
2	5	14	And as to why there is that (cake) for Vaisvânara;--Vaisvânara ('belonging to all men') truly is the year, and Pragâpati is the year; and Pragâpati indeed thereby created abundance and creatures, thinking, 'May I be consecrated, having created abundance and creatures!' And in like manner does that (king) thereby create abundance and creatures, thinking, 'May I be consecrated, having created abundance and creatures!'
2	5	15	And why it is one on twelve potsherds;--twelve months there are in the year, and Vaisvânara is the year: this is why it is one on twelve potsherds.
2	5	16	And as to why there is a barley pap for Varuna; he thereby frees the creatures from every snare of Varuna, from all that comes from Varuna ;and those creatures of his are produced sound and faultless: 'May I be consecrated for sound and faultless creatures (or subjects)!' he thinks.
2	5	17	A bull is the fee for the Vaisvânara (oblation); for Vaisvânara is the year, and Pragâpati is the year; and the bull is the Pragâpati (lord of creatures or generation) among cows: therefore a bull is the fee for the Vaisvânara. A black cloth for the Vâruna (oblation), for what is black belongs to Varuna. If he cannot obtain a black one, any kind of cloth will do: it is by its knots that the cloth belongs to Vanilla, for the knot is sacred to Varuna.
3	1	1	Having taken up both (the Gârhapatya and Âhavanîya) fires on the two kindling-sticks , he goes to the house of the Commander of the army, and prepares a cake on eight potsherds for Agni Anîkavat; for Agni is the head (anîka) of the gods, and the commander is the head of the army: hence for Agni Anîkavat. And he, the commander, assuredly is one of his (the king's) jewels : it is forhim that he is thereby consecrated (or quickened), and him he makes his own faithful (follower). The sacrificial fee for this (jewel-offering) consists in gold; for Agni's is that sacrifice, and gold is Agni's seed: therefore the sacrificial fee consists in gold.
3	1	2	And on the following day, he goes to the house of the Purohita (the king's court chaplain), and prepares a pap for Brihaspati; for Brihaspati is the Purohita of the gods, and that (court chaplain) is the Purohita ('praepositus') of that (king): hence it is for Brihaspati. And he, the Purohita, assuredly is one of his (the king's) jewels: it is for him that he is thereby consecrated, and him he makes his own faithful follower. The sacrificial fee for this is a white-backed bullock; for to Brihaspati belongs that upper region, and there above lies that path of Aryaman (the sun) : therefore the fee for the Bârhaspatya (oblation) is a white-backed (bullock).
3	1	3	And on the following day he prepares a cake on eleven potsherds for Indra at the dwelling of him who is being consecrated (the king); for Indra is the Kshatra (ruling power), and he who is consecrated isthe Kshatra: hence it is for Indra. The sacrificial fee for this is a bull, for the bull is Indra's own (animal).
3	1	4	And on the following day, he goes to the dwelling of the Queen, and prepares a pap for Aditi; for Aditi is this Earth, and she is the wife of the gods; and that (queen) is the wife of that (king): hence it is for Aditi. And she, the Queen, assuredly is one of his (the king's) jewels: it is for her that he is thereby consecrated, and he makes her his own faithful (wife). The sacrificial fee, on her part, is a milch cow; for this (earth) is, as it were, a milch cow: she yields to men all their desires; and the milch cow is a mother, and this (earth) is, as it were, a mother: she bears (or sustains) men. Hence the fee is a milch cow.
3	1	5	And on the following day, he goes to the house of the Sûta (court-minstrel and chronicler), and prepares a barley pap for Varuna; for the Sûta is a spiriter (sava), and Varuna is the spiriter of the gods: therefore it is for Varuna. And he, the Sûta, assuredly is one of his (the king's) jewels: it is for him that he is thereby consecrated; and him he makes his own faithful (follower). The sacrificial fee for this one is a horse, for the horse is Varuna's own.
3	1	6	And on the following day, he goes to the house of the Headman (Grâmanî ), and prepares a cakeon seven potsherds for the Maruts; for the Maruts are the peasants, and the headman is a peasant: therefore it is for the Maruts. And he, the headman, assuredly is one of his (the king's) jewels: it is for him that he is thereby consecrated, and him he makes his own faithful follower. The sacrificial fee for this (jewel) is a spotted bullock, for in such a spotted bullock there is abundance of colours; and the Maruts are the clans (or peasants), and the clan means abundance; therefore the sacrificial fee is a spotted bullock.
3	1	7	And on the following day he goes to the house of the Chamberlain (kshattri), and prepares a cake on either twelve, or eight, potsherds for Savitri; for Savitri is the impeller (prasavitri) of the gods, and the chamberlain is an impeller: hence it is for Savitri. And he, the chamberlain, assuredly is one of his (the king's) jewels: it is for him that he thereby is consecrated, and him he makes his own faithful (follower). The sacrificial fee for this (jewel) is a reddish-white draught-bullock; for Savitri is he that burns yonder, and he (the sun) indeed moves along; and the draught-bullock also moves along, when yoked. And as to why it is a reddish-white one;--reddish-white indeed is he (the sun) both in rising and in setting: therefore the sacrificial fee is a reddish-white draught-bullock.
3	1	8	And on the following day he goes to the houseof the Charioteer (samgrahîtri), and prepares a cake on two potsherds for the Asvins; for the two Asvins are of the same womb; and so are the chariot fighter  and the driver (sârathi) of the same womb (standing-place), since they stand on one and the same chariot: hence it is for the Asvins. And he, the charioteer, assuredly is one of his (the king's) jewels: it is for him that he is thereby consecrated, and him he makes his own faithful follower. The sacrificial fee for this (jewel) is a pair of twin bullocks, for such twin bullocks are of the same womb. If he cannot obtain twins, two bullocks produced by successive births (of the same cow) may also form the sacrificial fee, for such also are of the same womb.
3	1	9	And on the following day he goes to the houseof the Carver (bhâgadugha ), and prepares a pap for Pûshan, for Pûshan is carver to the gods; and that (officer) is carver to that (king): therefore it is for Pûshan. And he, the carver, assuredly is one of his (the king's) jewels: it is for him that he is thereby consecrated, and him he makes his own faithful follower. The sacrificial fee for this (jewel) is a dark-grey bullock: the significance of such a one being the same as at the Trishamyukta .
3	1	10	And on the following day, having brought together gavedhukâ (seeds) from the houses of the Keeper of the dice (akshâvâpa ) and the Huntsman (govikartana ), he prepares a gavedhukâ pap for Rudra at the house of him who is consecrated. These two, while being two jewels (of the king), he makes one for the purpose of completeness. And as to why he performs this offering,--Rudra is hankering after that (cow) which is killed here in this hall;now Rudra is Agni (fire), and the gaming-board being fire, and the dice being its coals, it is him (Rudra) he thereby pleases. And verily whosoever, that knows this thus, performs the Râgasûya, in his house that approved (cow) is killed. And he, the keeper of dice, and the huntsman, are (each of them) assuredly one of his (the king's) jewels: it is for these two that he is thereby consecrated, and these two he makes his own faithful followers. The sacrificial fee for this (jewel) is a bicoloured bullock--either one with white fore-feet, or a white-tailed one,--a claw-shaped knife, and a dice-board  with a horsehair band ; for that is what belongs to those two .
3	1	11	And on the following day he goes to the house of the Courier, and having taken ghee in four ladlings, he offers the ghee to the way, with, 'May the way graciously accept of the ghee, hail!' For the courier is to be dispatched, and when dispatched goes on his way: therefore he offers the ghee to the way. And he, the courier, assuredly is one of his (the king's) jewels: it is for him that he is thereby consecrated, and him he makes his own faithful follower. The sacrificial fee for this (jewel) consists in a skin-covered bow, leathern quivers, and a red turban, for that is what belongs to him.
3	1	12	These are the eleven jewels (ratna) he completes; for of eleven syllables consists the Trishtubh, and the Trishtubh is vigour: it is for the sakeof vigour that he completes the (eleven) jewels. Then as to why he performs the oblations of the Ratnins: it is their king he becomes; it is for them that he thereby is consecrated, and it is them he makes his own faithful followers.
3	1	13	And on the following day he goes to the house of a discarded (wife), and prepares a pap for Nirriti;--a discarded wife is one who has no son. He cooks the pap for Nirriti of black rice, after splitting the grains with his nails. He offers it with , 'This, O Nirriti, is thy share: accept it graciously, hail!' For a wife that is without a son, is possessed with Nirriti (destruction, calamity); and whatever of Nirriti's nature there is in her, that he thereby propitiates, and thus Nirriti does not take possession of him while he is consecrated. The fee for this (oblation) consists of a black, decrepit, diseased cow; for such a one also is possessed with Nirriti. He says to her (the wife), 'Let her not dwell this day in my dominion ! thus he removes evil from himself.
3	2	1	After the 'jewels' he offers (a pap) to Soma and Rudra. It is cooked in milk from a white (cow) which has a white calf. And as to why, after the 'jewels,' he offers (a pap) to Soma and Rudra.
3	2	2	Now, once upon a time, Svarbhânu, the Âsura, struck the sun with darkness, and stricken with darkness he did not shine . Soma and Rudraremoved that darkness of his; and freed from evil he burns yonder. And in like manner does that (king) thereby enter darkness,--or darkness enters him,--when he puts those unworthy of sacrifice  in contact with the sacrifice; and he does indeed now put those unworthy of sacrifice--either Sûdras or whomever else--in contact with the sacrifice. It is Soma and Rudra who remove that darkness of his; and freed from evil he becomes consecrated. And as to why it is cooked in milk from a white (cow) which has a white calf,--darkness is black: that darkness he removes. The sacrificial fee for this (oblation) is a white (cow) which has a white calf.
3	2	3	Even he who, while being qualified for fame, is not yet famous, may perform that offering. Now he who is learned (in the Veda), while being qualified for fame, is not famous; and he who is not famous, is covered with darkness: that darkness of his Soma and Rudra thereby remove; and freed from evil he becomes a very light by his prosperity and renown.
3	2	4	Thereupon he prepares a pap for Mitra and Brihaspati . For verily he who departs from thepath of the sacrifice stumbles; and he does indeed depart from the path of the sacrifice, when he puts those unworthy of sacrifice in contact with the sacrifice, and he does indeed now put those unworthy of sacrifice--either Sûdras or whomever else--in contact with the sacrifice. And the path of the sacrifice is Mitra and Brihaspati; for Mitra is the Brahman, and the Brahman is the sacrifice; and Brihaspati is the Brahman, and the Brahman is the sacrifice. Thus he, returns again to the path of the sacrifice; and as soon as he has returned to the path of the sacrifice he is consecrated: therefore he prepares a pap for Mitra and Brihaspati.
3	2	5	The course of this (is as follows). Any asvattha branch broken off by itself, either on the eastern or on the northern side (of the tree), from that he makes a vessel (to hold the pap) for Mitra; for that which is hewn by the axe belongs to Varuna; but that which is broken off by itself belongs to Mitra: therefore he makes the vessel for Mitra from a branch broken off by itself.
3	2	6	Thereupon having curdled the (milk into) curds, and poured it into a leathern bag; and having put (the horses) to the cart, and fastened (the bag on the cart), he tells it to 'fly away.' This is that (kind of) fresh butter which is self-produced ; for that which is churned belongs to Varuna, and that which is self-produced belongs to Mitra: therefore it is self-produced butter.
3	2	7	They divide the rice-grains into two parts: the smaller and broken ones belong to Brihaspati,and the larger and unbroken ones to Mitra. For Mitra injures no one, nor does any one injure Mitra; neither a kusa stalk nor a thorn pricks him, nor has he any scar; for Mitra is every one's friend (mitram).
3	2	8	He then puts the pap for Brihaspati on (the fire), covers it with the vessel for Mitra's (pap), pours the butter (into the latter), and throws in the (larger) rice-grains. It is cooked merely by the hot steam ; for what is cooked by fire belongs to Varuna, and what is cooked by hot steam belongs to Mitra: therefore it is cooked by hot steam. Making cuttings from both these sacrificial dishes, he says, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Mitra and Brihaspati!' Having called for the Sraushat, he says, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to Mitra and Brihaspati!' and offers as the Vashat is uttered.
3	3	1	He performs the initiation ceremony. On the day of preparation he seizes the victim for Agniand Soma. Having performed the offering of the omentum thereof; he prepares a cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Soma . Thereupon the offerings of the Divine Quickeners (Devasû) are prepared.
3	3	2	For Savitri Satyaprasava (of true impulse) he prepares a cake from fast-grown (plâsuka) rice , on either twelve, or eight, potsherds; for Savitri is the impeller (prasavitri) of the gods: 'May I be quickened , impelled by Savitri!' thus (he thinks). And as to (its being) of fast-grown rice: 'May they quickly impel me!' he thinks.
3	3	3	For Agni Grihapati (the house-lord) he then prepares a cake on eight potsherds from quick-grown (âsu) rice ; for the house-lord's position means prosperity: as much as he (the king) rules over, overthat Agni, the house-lord, leads him to hold the position of a master of the house. And as to its being of quick-grown rice: 'May they quickly lead me!' so he thinks.
3	3	4	For Soma Vanaspati (the wood-lord or tree) he then prepares a pap of syâmâka millet: thereby Soma, the wood-lord, quickens him for the plants. And as to its being prepared of syâmâka,--they, the syâmâkas among plants doubtless are most manifestly Soma's own: therefore it is prepared of syâmâka grain.
3	3	5	For Brihaspati Vâk  (speech) he then prepares a pap of wild rice: thereby Brihaspati quickens him for speech. And as to its being prepared of wild rice,--Brihaspati is the Brahman, and they, the wild rice-plants, are ripened by the Brahman : hence it is prepared of wild rice.
3	3	6	For Indra Gyeshtha (the most excellent) he then prepares a pap of red rice-grains (hâyana) : thereby Indra, the most excellent, leads him to excellence (or, lordship). And as to its being prepared of red rice: outstanding doubtless are those plants, the red rice, and outstanding is Indra: therefore it is prepared of red rice.
3	3	7	For Rudra Pasupati (lord of beasts) he then prepares a Raudra pap of gavedhukâ seeds (coix barbata): thereby Rudra, the lord of beasts, quickenshim for cattle. And as to its being prepared of gavedhukâ seed;--that God is (the recipient of) refuse (remains of offering), and gavedhukâ seeds are refuse: therefore it is (prepared) of gavedhukâ seed.
3	3	8	For Mitra Satya (the True) he then prepares a pap of Nâmba  seed: thereby Mitra the True quickens him for the Brahman. And as to its being prepared of Nâmba seed,--to Varuna, no doubt, belong those plants which grow in ploughed ground; but those, the Nâmba plants, belong to Mitra: therefore it is (prepared) of Nâmba seed.
3	3	9	For Varuna Dharmapati (the lord of the law) he then prepares a Varuna pap of barley: thereby Varuna, the lord of the law, makes him lord of the law; and that truly is the supreme state, when one is lord of the law; for whosoever attains to the supreme state, to him they come in (matters of) law: therefore to Varuna Dharmapati.
3	3	10	He then proceeds with the cake for Agni-Soma. The Svishtakrit of that (oblation) remains yet unoffered, when he proceeds with those (other) oblations.
3	3	11	Thereupon, taking hold of him (the Sacrificer) by the right arm, he mutters , 'May Savitri quicken thee for (powers of) quickening (ruling) , Agni for householders, Soma for trees, Brihaspati for speech, Indra for lordship, Rudra for cattle, Mitra for truth, Varuna for the lord of the law.'
3	3	12	'Quicken him, O gods, to be unrivalled!' --he thereby says, 'Quicken him, O gods, so as to be without an enemy; for great chiefdom, for great lordship!' in this there is nothing obscure;--'for man-rule!' 'for the ruling of men,' he thereby says;--'for Indra's energy!' 'for vigour' he means to say when he says, 'for Indra's energy;'--'him, the son of such and such (a man), the son of such and such (a woman),'--whatever be his parentage, with reference to that he says this;--'of such and such a people,' that is to say, of the people whose king he is;--'this man, O ye (people) , is your king, Soma is the king of us Brahmans!' He thereby causes everything here to be food for him (the king); the Brâhman alone he excepts: therefore the Brâhman is not to be fed upon, for he has Soma for his king.
3	3	13	Now those gods have the power of quickening, whence their name 'devasû' (Divine Quickeners). It is those gods who now quicken him thus, and quickened (consecrated) by them he will be consecrated on the morrow.
3	3	14	They are double-named, for a coupling means strength: 'May the strong quicken (him),' thus he thinks, and therefore they are double-named.
3	3	15	He now says, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni Svishtakrit.' And as to why that ceremony is performed here between two offerings ,--verily Pragâpati is that sacrifice which is here performed, and from which all these creatures were produced,--and so they are even now produced after this one. Thus he places him (the Sacrificer) in the very middle of that Pragâpati, and quickens him in the middle: this is why that ceremony is performed between two offerings. Having called for the Sraushat. he says, 'Urge for Agni Svishtakrit!' and offers as the Vashat is pronounced.
3	4	1	He collects (various kinds of) water. The reason why he collects water, is that--water being vigour--he thereby collects vigour, the essence of die waters.
3	4	2	In a vessel of udumbara wood,--the udumbara (ficus glomerata) being sustenance, (that is) food---for the obtainment of sustenance, food: hence in an udumbara vessel (he mixes the different liquids).
3	4	3	He first takes (water)  from the (river) Sarasvatî, with (Vâg. S. X, i), 'The gods took honey-sweet water,'--whereby he says, 'the gods took water full of essence;'--'sapful, deemed king-quickening,'--by 'sapful' he means to say, 'full of essence;' and by 'deemed king-quickening' he means to say, '(water) which is recognised as king-quickening;'--'wherewith they anointed Mitra and Varuna,' for therewith they did anoint (sprinkle) Mitra and Varuna;--'wherewith they guided Indra past his enemies,' for therewith they indeed guided Indra past the fiends, the Rakshas. Therewith he sprinkles him,--Sarasvatî being (the goddess of) Speech: it is with speech he thereby sprinkles him. This is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.
3	4	4	Thereupon the Adhvaryu, having taken ghee in four ladlings, steps down into the water, and takes the two waves which flow away (in different directions) after an animal or a man has stept (or plunged) into it.
3	4	5	The one which rises in front of him he catches up with , 'Thou art the male's wave, a bestower of kingship: bestow kingship on me, hail!--Thou art the male's wave, a bestower of kingship: bestow kingship on N.N.!'
3	4	6	He then catches up that (wave) which rises up behind him with, 'Thou art the lord of a host of males, a bestower of kingship: bestow kingship on me, hail!--Thou art the lord of a host of males, a bestower of kingship: bestow kingship on N.N.!' With that (water) he sprinkles; for indeed that is the vigour of the water which rises when either beast or man plunges into it: it is with vigour he thus sprinkles him. This is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.
3	4	7	He then takes flowing (water) with , 'Task-plying ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on me, hail!--Task-plying ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on N.N.!' With that (water) he sprinkles; for with vigour these (waters) flow, whence nothing stops them flowing along: it iswith vigour he thus sprinkles him. This is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.
3	4	8	He then takes such (water) as flows against the stream of the flowing water with, 'Powerful ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on me, hail!--Powerful ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on N.N.!' With that (water) he sprinkles, for with vigour indeed those (waters) flow against the stream of the flowing ones: it is with vigour he thus sprinkles him. This is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.
3	4	9	He then takes (water) that flows off (the main current) with, 'Overflowing waters ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on me, hail!--Overflowing waters ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on N.N.!' With that (water) he sprinkles. Now that (flow of water), after separating itself from that (main current), comes to be that again ; and so there is in his kingdom even one belonging to some other kingdom, and even that man from another kingdom he absorbs: thus he (the Adhvaryu) bestows abundance upon him (the king), and it is with abundance that he thus consecrates him. This is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.
3	4	10	He then takes the lord of rivers (sea-water) with, 'Thou art the lord of waters, a bestower of kingship: bestow thou kingship on me, hail!--Thou art the lord of waters, a bestower of kingship: bestow thou kingship on N.N.!' With that (water) he sprinkles him; and that lord of rivers (the ocean) being the same as the lord of waters, he thereby makes him (the king) the lord of the people. This is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.
3	4	11	He then takes (water from) a whirlpool with, 'Thou art the offspring of the waters, a bestower of kingship: bestow thou kingship on me, hail!--Thou art the offspring of the waters, a bestower of kingship: bestow thou kingship on N.N.!' With that (water) he sprinkles. Now the waters enclose the offspring (embryo): he thus makes him the offspring of the people. This is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.
3	4	12	Then what standing pool of flowing water there is in a sunny spot, that (water) he takes with , 'Sun-skinned ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on me, hail!--Sun-skinned ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on N.N.!' With that (water) he sprinkles: it is with lustre he thereby sprinkles him, and makes him sun-skinned. Now it is to Varuna that those waters belong which, (whilst being part) of flowing water, do not flow: and Varuna's quickening (sava) is that Râgasûya: therefore he sprinkles him therewith. This is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.
3	4	13	He then catches such (water) as it rains while the sun shines, with, 'Lustrous as the sun ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on me, hail!--Lustrous as the sun ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on N.N.!' With this (water) he sprinkles: it is with lustre he thereby sprinkles him, and lustrousas the sun he thereby makes him. And pure indeed is such water as it rains while the sun shines, for before it has reached this (earth), he catches it: he thus makes him pure thereby. This is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.
3	4	14	He then takes (water) from a pond with, 'Pleasing ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on me!--Pleasing ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on N.N.!' With that (water) he sprinkles: he thereby makes the people steady and faithful to him. This is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.
3	4	15	He then draws (water) from a well with, 'Fold-dwellers ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on me, hail!--Fold-dwellers ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on N.N.!' With this (water) he sprinkles. He thereby brings (some of) the water which is beyond this (earth), and also (he does so) for the completeness of the waters, this is why he sprinkles him therewith. This is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.
3	4	16	He then takes dew-drops  with, 'Devoted ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on me, hail!--Devoted ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on N.N.!' With that (water) he sprinkles: it is with food he thereby consecrates him, and food he thereby bestows upon him, For even as this fire burns up (the wood) so does that sun yonder, even in rising, burn up the plants, the food. But those waters coming down, quench that (heat), for if those waters were not to come down, there would be no food left remaining here: it is with food he thus sprinkles him. This is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.
3	4	17	He then takes honey with, 'Most powerful ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on me, hail!--Most powerful ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on N.N.!' With this (water) he sprinkles, and it is by the essence of the waters and plants that he thereby sprinkles him. This is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.
3	4	18	He then takes embryonic (waters) of a calving cow with, 'Mighty ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on me, hail!--Mighty ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on N.N.!' With that (water) he sprinkles: it is with cattle he thereby consecrates him. This is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.
3	4	19	He then takes milk with, 'Man-supporting ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on me, hail!--Man-supporting ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on N.N.!' With that (water) he sprinkles:it is with cattle he thereby consecrates him. This is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.
3	4	20	He then takes clarified butter with, 'All-supporting ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on me, hail!--All-supporting ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on N.N.!' With that (water) he sprinkles: it is with the essence of cattle he thereby consecrates him. This is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.
3	4	21	Having then caught up (moist) sun-motes with the hollow of his hands, he mixes them (with the other kinds of water), with, 'Self-ruling waters ye are, bestowers of kingship: bestow ye kingship on N.N.!' For those sun-motes are indeed self-ruling waters, since they are flowing, as it were, and, not yielding to one another's superiority, keep being now higher now lower: he thus thereby bestows self-ruling power upon him. This is one kind of water: it is that he now brings.
3	4	22	These then are seventeen (kinds of) water he brings together, for Pragâpati is seventeenfold, and Pragâpati is the sacrifice: that is why he brings together seventeen kinds of water.
3	4	23	Now sixteen kinds of water are those he offers upon; and he offers sixteen oblations: that makes thirty-two. On two of them he does not offer, viz. on the water from the Sarasvatî and on the sun-motes: that makes thirty-four. For three and thirty are the gods, and Pragâpati is the thirty-fourth: he thus makes him to be Pragâpati (the lord of creatures).
3	4	24	And as to why he takes (water) each time after offering,--the ghee, to be sure, is a thunderbolt:having won them, one by one, by means of that thunderbolt, the ghee, and made them his own, he takes them.
3	4	25	And as to why he does not offer on the (water) from the Sarasvatî,--Sarasvatî, to be sure, is (the goddess of) Speech, and the ghee is a thunderbolt: 'Lest I should injure (the goddess of) Speech! thus (he thinks, and) therefore he does not offer on the water from the Sarasvatî.
3	4	26	And as to why he does not offer on the sun-motes: 'Lest I should offer that oblation in a doubtful way !' thus (he thinks, and) therefore he does not offer on the sun-motes.
3	4	27	He pours them together into an udumbara vessel with, 'Let the honey-sweet mix with the honey-sweet!'--'Let those full of essence mix with those full of essence!' he thereby says;--'Winning great power (kshatra) for the Kshatriya!' in saying this he prays in a covert way for power to the Sacrificer.
3	4	28	He deposits them in front of the Maitrâvaruna's hearth, with, 'Unimpaired rest ye, the strengthful!'--'unimpaired by the Rakshas rest ye!' he thereby says; and by 'strengthful' he means to say 'powerful; 'bestowing great power on the Kshatriya;'--in saying this he prays in an overt way for power to the Sacrificer.
3	5	1	He consecrates him at the midday Soma-feast. Now Pragâpati is that sacrifice which is here performed, and whence these creatures have beenproduced,--and so they are even now produced after this one: he thus places him in the very middle of that Pragâpati, and consecrates him in the middle.
3	5	2	Before the Mâhendra (cup) has been drawn,--for that Mâhendra cup is Indra's special (nishkevalya) cup, and so is that Nishkevalya Stotra (hymn) and Nishkevalya Sastra (recitation); and the Sacrificer is Indra: he thus consecrates him--in his own resting-place. Hence before the Mâhendra (cup) has been drawn,--
3	5	3	He spreads a tiger-skin in front of the Maitrâvaruna's hearth , with , 'Thou art Soma's beauty.' For because when Soma flowed through Indra he (Indra) thereupon became a tiger, therefore he is Soma's beauty: this is why he says, 'Thou art Soma's splendour;'--'may my beauty become like unto thine!' He thus bestows the tiger's beauty on him: therefore he says, 'May my beauty become like unto thine!'
3	5	4	He then offers the Pârtha oblations. Now Prithin Vainya was consecrated first of men. He desired that he might appropriate to himself all food. They offered up for him those (oblations), and he appropriated to himself all the food here on earth. They would even call forest beasts to him, saying, 'Come hither thou (beast) so and so, the king wants to cook thee!' Thus he appropriated all food here on earth; and verily he appropriates to himself all food for whom that knows this those (oblations) are offered.
3	5	5	There are twelve of them,--for there aretwelve months in the year: therefore there are twelve of them.
3	5	6	Six he offers before, and six after, the consecration: he thereby places him in the very middle of that Pragâpati, and consecrates him in the middle.
3	5	7	Now of those which he offers before the consecration, Brihaspati is the last (recipient), and of those which he offers after the consecration, Indra is the first;--but Brihaspati is priestly dignity (brahma), and Indra is might, vigour: with these two kinds of vigour he thus encloses him on both sides.
3	5	8	Those which he offers before the consecration, he offers (resp.) with, 'To Agni hail!'--Agni is brightness (tegas): with brightness he thus sprinkles (endows) him;--'To Soma hail!'--Soma is princely power (kshatra): with princely power he thus sprinkles him;--'To Savitri hail!'--Savitri is the impeller of the gods: impelled by Savitri he thus consecrates him;--'To Sarasvatî hail!'--Sarasvatî is Speech: he thus sprinkles him with Speech;--'To Pûshan hail!'--Pûshan is cattle: with cattle he thus sprinkles him;--'To Brihaspati hail!'--Brihaspati is priestly dignity: with priestly dignity he thus sprinkles him. These he offers before the consecration: these are called the Agni-named ones.
3	5	9	Those which he offers after the consecration, he offers (resp.) with, 'To Indra hail!'--Indra is vigour: with vigour he thus sprinkles him;--'To the roar hail!'--roar means vigour: with vigour he thus sprinkles him;--'To the noise hail! 'noise means vigour: with vigour he thus sprinkles him;--'To Amsa hail!'--Amsa is vigour: with vigour he thus sprinkles him;--'To Bhaga hail!'--Bhaga is vigour: with vigour he thus sprinkleshim;--'To Aryaman hail!'--he thus makes him the friend (aryaman) of everything here. These he offers after the consecration: these are called the Âditya-named  ones.
3	5	10	In front of the Maitrâvaruna's hearth are the (four) consecration vessels in which that consecration water is contained .
3	5	11	There is a palâsa (butea frondosa) one: with (the water of) that (vessel) a Brâhman sprinkles;--the Palâsa tree is priestly dignity (brahman): it is with priestly dignity that he sprinkles (endows) him.
3	5	12	There is an udumbara (ficus glomerata) one: therewith one of his own (kinsmen, or brothers) sprinkles. The udumbara tree means sustenance, (that is) food, and the 'own' means sustenance, for as far as a man's own goes, so far he does not hunger: thereby his 'own' is sustenance, and therefore one of his own (kinsmen) sprinkles with an udumbara (vessel).
3	5	13	There is one made of the foot (stem) of the nyagrodha (ficus indica): therewith a friendly (mitrya) Râganya sprinkles: for by its feet  thenyagrodha tree is supported, and by the friend (mitra) the Râganya (nobleman or king) is supported: therefore a friendly Râganya sprinkles with (the water of a vessel) made of the foot of a nyagrodha.
3	5	14	There is an asvattha (ficus religiosa) one: therewith a Vaisya sprinkles. Because Indra on that (former) occasion called upon the Maruts staying on the Asvattha tree , therefore a Vaisya sprinkles with an asvattha (vessel). These are the consecration vessels.
3	5	15	He then prepares two strainers (pavitra), with , 'Purifiers ye are, Vishnu's own;'--the significance is the same (as before ). He weaves gold (threads) into them. With them he purifies those consecration waters. As to why he weaves gold (threads) in,--gold is immortal life: that immortal life he lays into these (waters), and hence he weaves gold (threads) in.
3	5	16	He purifies with, 'By the impulse of Savitri I purify you with a flawless purifier, with the rays of the sun.' The significance is the same (as before ). 'Not downfallen thou art, the friend of Speech, born of heat,'--unimpaired by the Rakshas he means to say when he says, 'not downfallen;'--'the friend of Speech'--as long as there is water in the vital airs, so long (man) speaks with speech: therefore he says, 'the friend of Speech.'
3	5	17	'Born of heat' he says, for from fire springs smoke, from smoke the cloud, from the cloud rain,--it is from fire that these are produced: hence he says, 'born of heat.'
3	5	18	'Soma's portion thou art;' for when they consecrate him with those (waters), then there is an oblation: therefore he says 'Soma's portion thou art;'--'Hail, spiriters of kings!'--it is with 'Hail' that he thus purifies them.
3	5	19	He distributes them over those (consecration) vessels, with , 'Playmates are these glorious waters;'--'not overbearing' he means to say, when he says 'playmates;' and by 'these glorious waters' he means to say 'the powerful ones;'--'unimpaired, active, enveloping,' he thereby means to say 'ye are unimpaired by the Rakshas;'--'In the habitations Varuna hath made a home;'--the habitations are the people (clans): 'in the people Varuna has made a support' he thereby says;--'he, the child of the waters, in the best of mothers;'--for he who performs the Râgasûya is indeed the child of the waters: therefore he says, 'the child of the waters, in the best of mothers.'
3	5	20	He then makes him (the king) put on garments. There is that one called târpya ; therein arewrought  all forms of sacrifice: that he makes him put on, with , 'Thou art the inner caul of knighthood (kshatra)!' He thus causes him to be born from out of what is the inner caul (amnion) of knighthood.
3	5	21	He then makes him put on one of undyed wool, with, 'Thou art the outer caul of knighthood!' He thus causes him to be born from what is the outer caul (chorion) of knighthood.
3	5	22	He then throws over the mantle, with, 'Thou art the womb of knighthood!' He thus causes him to be born from what is the womb of knighthood.
3	5	23	He then draws the head-band together, and conceals it (tucks it under) in front , with, 'Thou art the navel of knighthood!' He thus places him in what is the navel of knighthood.
3	5	24	Now some wind it quite round about (the navel) saying, 'that (band) is his navel, and this navel goes all round.' But let him not do this, but let him merely tuck it under in front, for this navel is in front. And as to why he makes him put on the garments;--he thereby causes him to be born ,thinking, 'I will anoint him when born:' that is why he makes him put on the garments.
3	5	25	Now some put off those garments , and make him put on again the garment of initiation. But let him not do this; for, the limbs  being his natural vestments, they deprive him of his limbs, of his native bodily form. The garment of initiation belongs to Varuna. Let him put on one of those same garments: he (the priest) thereby causes him to be furnished with his limbs, his native bodily form. The garment of initiation belongs to Varuna: he thus saves him from the Varunic garment of initiation.
3	5	26	And when he enters the bath  they throw it into (the water). This is a congruous  performance. After putting on one of those same garments he comes out (of the bath). Let him give away those (garments) either when the omentum of the barren cow has been offered , or at the completing oblation .
3	5	27	He (the Adhvaryu) then strings the bow, with, 'Thou art Indra's Vritra-killer;' for the bowis indeed a Vritra-killer, and the Sacrificer is Indra,--he is Indra in a twofold way, both as a Kshatriya, and as Sacrificer: therefore he says, 'Thou art Indra's Vritra-killer.'
3	5	28	He then strokes the two arms , with, 'Mitra's thou art,--Varuna's thou art;' for the bow is within the two arms, and by his two arms the Râganya pertains to Mitra and Varuna: therefore he says, 'Mitra's thou art, Varuna's thou art.' He hands it to him, with, 'May he slay Vritra by thee!' whereby he means to say, 'May he slay by thee his spiteful enemy!'
3	5	29	He then hands him three arrows. That first-one by which he pierces on shooting , that is one, that one is this earth, that one is called 'dribâ.' And the one by which (the enemy) being pierced lies either living or dead, that is the second, that is this air, that is called 'rugâ.' And the one with which he misses (his aim) , that is the third, that is yonder sky, that is called 'kshumâ.' For these are the three (kinds of) arrows: therefore he hands him three arrows.
3	5	30	These he hands to him with, 'Protect ye him in front !--Protect ye him from behind!--Protect ye him from the side!--Protect yehim from (all) quarters!' Thus he makes all the quarters safe from arrows for him. And as to why he hands the bow to him;--this, the bow, truly is the nobleman's strength: it is because he thinks, 'I will consecrate him when endowed with strength!' that he hands the weapon to him .
3	5	31	Thereupon he makes him pronounce the âvid formulas  , 'In sight, ye mortals! This is mysterious for mysterious is Pragâpati: he thus announces him to Pragâpati, and this one approves of his consecration; and approved by him he is consecrated.
3	5	32	'Present is Agni, the house-lord;'---Agni is the priesthood (brahman); he thus announces him to the priesthood; and it approves of his consecration, and approved by it he is consecrated.
3	5	33	'Present is Indra, the far-famed;'--Indra is the nobility: he thus announces him to the nobility; and, it approves of his consecration, and approved by it he is consecrated.
3	5	34	'Present are Mitra and Varuna, the upholders of the law;'--Mitra and Varuna are the out-breathing and in-breathing: he thus announces him to the out-breathing and in-breathing, and they approve of his consecration, and approved by them he is consecrated.
3	5	35	'Present is Pûshan, the all-possessing;' Pûshan is (the lord of) cattle: he thus announces him to the cattle, and they approve of his consecration; and approved by them he is consecrated.
3	5	36	'Present are Heaven and Earth, the all-propitious;'--he thus announces him to those two, the heaven and the earth, and they approve of his consecration; and approved by them he is consecrated.
3	5	37	'Present is Aditi, of wide shelter;'--Aditi is this earth: he thus announces him to this earth, and she approves of his consecration, and approved by her he is consecrated. Thus to whatever deities he announces him, they approve of his consecration, and approved by them he is consecrated.
4	1	1	He puts a piece of copper  into the mouth of a long-haired man, with , 'Removed by sacrifice are the mordacious.' For verily he who performs the Râgasûya escapes all kinds of death, all murderous blows, and old age alone is his death: hence whatever kind of death, whatever murderous blow there is, past that he now guides him, as past the mordacious ones.
4	1	2	And as to why it is of a long-haired man,--such a long-haired man is neither woman nor man; for being a male, he is not a woman, and being longhaired (a eunuch), he is not a man. And copper (or bronze) is neither iron nor gold; and those mordacious ones (snakes) are neither worms nor non-worms. And as to its being copper,--reddishto be sure are mordacious ones: therefore (he throws it in the face) of a long-haired man.
4	1	3	He then makes him ascend the regions, with , 'Ascend thou the East! May the Gâyatrî (metre) protect thee, the Rathantara-sâman, the threefold stoma, the spring season, the Priesthood, that precious treasure!'
4	1	4	'Ascend thou the South! May the Trishtubh protect thee, the Brihat-sâman, the fifteenfold stoma, the summer season, the Knighthood, that precious treasure!'
4	1	5	'Ascend thou the West! May the Gagatî protect thee, the Vairûpa-sâman, the seventeenfold stoma, the rainy season, the Peasantry, that precious treasure!'
4	1	6	'Ascend thou the North! May the Anushtubh protect thee, the Vairâga-sâman, the twenty-onefold stoma, the autumn season, fruit, that precious treasure!'
4	1	7	'Ascend thou the upper region! May the Paṅkti protect thee, the Sâkvara and Raivata-sâmans, the thrice-ninefold and the three and thirtyfold stomas, the winter and dewy season, spiritual lustre, that precious treasure!'
4	1	8	And as to why he makes him ascend the quarters,--that is a form of the seasons: it is the seasons, the year, that he thereby makes him ascend; and having ascended the seasons, the year, he is high, high above everything here, and everything here is below him.
4	1	9	On the hind part of the tiger's skin  a piece oflead is laid down. He kicks it off with his foot, with , 'Kicked off is Namuki's head!' Now there was once an Âsura, Namuki by name. Indra knocked him down, and trod with his foot upon him. And in that he, thus trodden upon, bulged out, that (is the origin of) a rupture. He tore off his head with his foot, and therefrom sprang a goblin (Rakshas). That one kept calling out to him, 'Whither art thou going? Where wilt thou rid thyself of me?'
4	1	10	He beat it off with (a disk of) lead: hence lead is soft, for it has lost its spring, as it beat off (the goblin) with all its might. Hence also, while being like gold, it is not worth anything; for it has lost its spring, as it beat off (the goblin) with all its might. And so, indeed, he (Indra) thereby beat off the fiends, the Rakshas; and in like manner this one (the king) thereby beats off the fiends, the Rakshas.
4	1	11	He then makes him step upon the tiger's skin, with , 'Thou art Soma's beauty;'--For because when Soma flowed through Indra, he (Indra) thereupon became a tiger, and therefore he is Soma's beauty: this is why he says, 'Thou art Soma's beauty;'--'May my beauty be like unto thine!'--The tiger's beauty he thereby bestows upon him: therefore he says, 'May my beauty be like unto thine!'
4	1	12	Below (the king's foot) he throws a (small) gold plate, with, 'Save (him) from death!'--Gold is immortal life: he thus takes his stand on immortal life.
4	1	13	Then there is (another) gold plate, perforated either with a hundred, or with nine, holes. If witha hundred holes,--man here lives up to a hundred (years), and has a hundred energies, a hundred powers; therefore it is perforated with a hundred holes. And if with nine holes,--there are in man those nine vital airs: therefore it is perforated with nine holes.
4	1	14	That (gold plate) he lays upon his head, with, 'Might thou art, victory thou art, immortality thou art!' Gold being immortal life, he thus lays immortal life into him. And as to why there are gold plates on both sides,--gold being immortal life,--he thus encloses him on both sides with immortal life: this is why there are gold plates on both sides.
4	1	15	He then lifts up his arms, with , 'Golden-bodied, ye two lords rise like the sun: mount ye the chariot, O Mitra and Varuna, and thence behold Aditi and Diti!' Mitra and Varuna verily are the two arms, and the chariot (-seat) is the man: therefore he says, 'Mount ye the chariot, O Mitra and Varuna!'--'thence behold Aditi and Diti!' By this he means to say, 'See ye your own (property) and that of others''
4	1	16	Let him not lift up (the king's arms) with that one, but let him rather lift them up with, 'Thou art Mitra, thou art Varuna;' for Mitra-Varuna are the two arms, and by his arms the Râganya belongs to Mitra and Varuna: let him therefore lift up his arms with, 'Thou art Mitra, thou art Varuna.'
4	1	17	And as to why he anoints him (standing) with upstretched arms;--those arms in truth are the Râganya's power, and power also is that collected essence of the waters wherewith he now anoints him: 'Lest that power, the collected essence of the waters, weigh down (paralyze) this power of mine, the arms,' thus he thinks, and therefore he anoints him (standing) with upstretched arms.
4	2	1	He (the king) is anointed (sprinkled) whilst standing with his face turned towards the east. A Brâhman--either the Adhvaryu, or he who is his (the king's) court chaplain--sprinkles him in front, from behind;--
4	2	2	With , 'With Soma's glory I sprinkle thee,'--'with vigour' he thereby says; 'With Agni's glow . . . ,'--'with vigour' he thereby says;--'With Sûrya's splendour . . .,'--'with vigour' he thereby says;--'With Indra's energy. . .,'--'with vigour' he thereby says;--'Be thou the chieftain of chiefs!'--'be thou the supreme king of kings' he thereby says;--'Guard (him)  against darts!'--darts meaning arrows, it is past murder by arrows that he thus guides him: therefore he says, 'guard him against darts!'
4	2	3	'Quicken him, O gods, tobe unrivalled!'--he thereby says, 'Quicken him, O gods, so as to be without an enemy;'--'For great chiefdom, for great lordship!'--in this there is nothing obscure;--'For man-rule!'--'for the ruling of men' he thereby says;--'For Indra's lordly sway!'--'for power' he means to say, when he says, 'for Indra's lordly sway!'--'Him, the son of such and such (a man), the son of such and such (a woman),'--whatever be his parentage regarding that he says this;--'of such and such a people'--that is to say, of the people whose king he is;--'This man, O ye (people), is your king, Soma is the king of us Brahmans!'--he thereby causes everything here to be food for him (the king); the Brâhman alone he excepts: therefore the Brâhman is not to be fed upon, for he has Soma for his king .
4	2	4	He (the king) then rubs the sprinkled waterover himself with the horn of a black antelope; for that collected essence of the waters wherewith he now anoints him means vigour: 'May this vigour of mine spread through my whole self,' thus he thinks, and therefore he rubs it all over himself.
4	2	5	He rubs it over himself, with , Forth from the back of the mountain, of the bull,'--even as the mountain stands out here, even as the bull stands out beyond the cattle, so does he who performs the Râgasûya stand out beyond everything here, and everything here is below him: therefore he says, 'Forth from the back of the mountain, of the bull,'--'The ships keep moving, the self-pouring; they, the upwards bent, have turned back downwards, flowing after the dragon of the deep .'
4	2	6	He then makes him step the (three) Vishnu-steps within (the extent of) the tiger's skin, with, 'Vishnu's outstepping thou art! Vishnu's outstep thou art! Vishnu's step thou art!' Now Vishnu's outstepping (vikramana), Vishnu's outstep (vikrânta), and Vishnu's step (krânta)  are these (three) worlds: thus having ascended these worlds, he is high above everything here, and everything here is below him.
4	2	7	He then pours the remainders (of the water) together into the Brâhman's vessel: he thereby makes the Brâhman an object of respect after the king, whence the Brâhman is an object of respect after the king.
4	2	8	And to him who is his (the king's) dearest son, he hands that vessel, thinking, 'May this son of mine perpetuate this vigour of mine!'
4	2	9	He then returns to the Gârhapatya fire, (his son) holding on to him behind, and offers, with , 'O Pragâpati, than thee none other hath encompassed all these forms: for whatsoever object we sacrifice, let that accrue unto us!--This one is the father of N.N.!'--him who is the son, he makes the father, and him who is the father, he makes the son : he thereby links together the vigour of both of them.--'N.N. is the father of this one!' him who is the father, he makes the father, and him who is the son, he makes the son: after linking together the vigour of these two, he puts it again in the proper way,--'May we be the lords of riches, hail!'--this is the blessing of that ceremony a blessing he thereby invokes.
4	2	10	And any residue that is left over, he offers in the Âgnîdhrîya; for redundant is that residue, and redundant also is the Âgnîdhrîya,--in the Gârhapatya they cook the oblations, and in the Âhavanîya they offer, but that one is redundant: thus he puts the redundant to the redundant. He offers it on the north part (of the hearth), for that is the region of that god (Rudra): hence he offers it on the northpart. He offers with, 'O Rudra, whatever potent , highest name is thine, therein thou art an offering, thou art a home-offering, hail!'
4	3	1	North of the Âhavanîya he places a hundred, or more than a hundred, cows of that relative of his. The reason why he does so is this:
4	3	2	When Varuna was consecrated, his energy, his vigour departed from him. Probably  that collected essence (life-sap) of the waters wherewith they were sprinkling him, drove out his energy, his vigour. He found it in the cattle, and because he found it in them, therefore cattle are an object of respect. And having found it in the cattle, he again took to himself his energy, his vigour. And in like manner this one;--that energy does not indeed depart from him, but he does it (thinking), 'This Râgasûya is Varuna's consecration, and Varuna did so.'
4	3	3	He takes down the chariot (from the stand ); for whatever turns away from the warrior (râganya) that he overtakes with his chariot: for this reason he takes down the chariot.
4	3	4	He takes it down with , 'Thou art Indra's thunderbolt!' The chariot is indeed a thunderbolt; and the Sacrificer is Indra;--he is Indra for a twofold reason, namely because he is a Kshatriya, and because he is a Sacrificer: therefore he says, 'Indra's thunderbolt thou art.'
4	3	5	Having turned it (so as to stand) inside the Vedi, he yokes it with, 'I yoke thee by the direction of Mitra and Varuna, the directors ;' for Mitra and Varuna are the two arms, and by his arms the Râganya belongs to Mitra and Varuna that is why he says, 'I yoke thee by direction of Mitra and Varuna, the directors.'
4	3	6	He yokes it with four (horses). He passes along by the same way as that on which the dakshinâs  go,--behind the Sadas, and in front of the hall. He stops it behind the kâtvâla, and in front of the Âgnîdhra.
4	3	7	He mounts it with, 'For unfeebleness (I mount) thee, for svadhâ  (I mount) thee!'--by 'for unfeebleness thee' he means to say, 'for a state free from afflictions (I mount) thee;' by 'for svadhâ thee' he means to say, 'for life-sap (I mount) thee;'--'I, the unharmed Arguna!' Now Indra is called Arguna, which is his mystic name; and this (king) is Indra for a twofold reason, namely because he is a Kshatriya, and because he is a Sacrificer: therefore he says, 'the unharmed Arguna.'
4	3	8	He then goads on the right yoke-horse, with, 'Conquer thou by the impulse of the Maruts!' For the Maruts are the clansmen, and it is by hisclan that the chieftain wins what he desires to win: therefore he says, 'Conquer thou by the impulse of the Maruts!'
4	3	9	He then stops (the chariot) in the midst of the cows , with, 'May we obtain by the mind!' For it is by the mind that everything here (that is obtained) is obtained; and by the mind therefore he now obtains everything: therefore he says, 'May we obtain by the mind!'
4	3	10	He then touches a cow with the end of the bow, with, 'Together with energy!'--energy means vigour, kine: it is energy, vigour, he thereby takes to himself. And he adds, 'I overpower them, I seize them!'
4	3	11	Now as to why he stops amidst the cows of his relative,--whatever is tending away from a man, be it either fame, or anything else, that passes over to his relative foremost of all;--that energy, or vigour, he now takes again from his relative to himself: that is why he stops amidst the cows of his relative.
4	3	12	In return he presents to him just as many (cows) , or more. For assuredly he, the Sacrificer,is not capable of a cruel deed; but cruelly indeed he acts when he says, 'I overpower them, I seize them;' and thus that is done by him without cruelty: this is why, in return, he presents to him just as many (cows) or more.
4	3	13	He then pulls the right-side (horses, or reins). He passes along on the same way as that on which the dakshinâ (cows) go,--in front of the sacrificial post, and along the south of the Vedi. Behind the Sadas, and in front of the hall, he stops that (car).
4	3	14	, 'Lest, O Indra, overpowerer of the mighty, we be wanting thee, heedless through ungodliness,--mount thou, O divine wielder of the thunderbolt, the chariot which thou restrainest (as well as its) well-horsed reins .' With this (verse) he stops (the chariot);--reins (rasmi) means bridle (abhîsu): therefore he says, 'Thou restrainest the well-horsed reins .' Thereupon he offers the (four oblations) relating to the unyoking of the chariot. 'Well-pleased the chariot shall be when unyoked,' he thinks, and therefore he offers the (oblations) relating to the unyoking of the chariot.
4	3	15	He offers with , 'To Agni, the House-lord, hail!' He thereby pleases the part of the chariot relating to Agni; and it is the shoulder-pieces of the chariot that relate to Agni it is the shoulder-pieces (of the yoke) he thereby pleases. And the house-lord's position means prosperity: as much as he (the king) rules over, forthe prosperity, the house-lordship, of that his kingship is thereby rendered free (unopposed).
4	3	16	'To Soma, the wood-lord (tree), hail!' There are two kinds of (objects) coming from trees, the wheels of chariots and waggons, for both of these he thereby ensures safety. And the wood-lord (tree) being Soma,--whatever part of the chariot comes from the tree, that he thereby pleases. Now the parts of the chariot coming from trees are the wooden pieces of the chariot: hence it is the wooden pieces he thereby pleases. And Soma being the nobility, it is over the nobility that his kingship is thereby rendered free.
4	3	17	'To the strength of the Maruts, hail!' He thereby pleases the part of the chariot belonging to the Maruts,--there are four horses, the chariot the fifth, and the warrior (chariot-fighter) and charioteer two--these are seven, and the host of the Maruts consists of (troops of) seven each: he thereby pleases the whole chariot; and the Maruts being the peasants, it is over the peasantry that his kingship is thereby rendered free.
4	3	18	'To Indra's energy, hail!' He thereby pleases the part of the chariot that belongs to Indra. Now the warrior relates to Indra, and it is the warrior he thereby pleases. And Indra's energy (indriya) means the vigour in Indra : it is in regard to energy, vigour, that his kingship is thereby rendered free.
4	3	19	He then puts on shoes of boar's skin. Now the gods once put a pot of ghee on the fire. Therefrom a boar was produced: hence the boar is fat,for it was produced from ghee. Hence also cows readily take to a boar: it is indeed their own essence (life-sap, blood) they are readily taking to. Thus he firmly establishes himself in the essence of the cattle: therefore he puts on shoes of boar's skin.
4	3	20	Looking down on this (earth) he then mutters, 'O mother Earth, injure me not, nor I thee!' For the Earth was once afraid of Varuna, when he had been consecrated, thinking, 'Something great surely has he become now that he has been consecrated: I fear lest he may rend me asunder!' And Varuna also was afraid of the Earth, thinking, 'I fear lest she may shake me off!' Hence by that (formula) he entered into a friendly relation with her; for a mother does not injure her son, nor does a son injure his mother.
4	3	21	Now this Râgasûya is Varuna's consecration; and the Earth is afraid of him, thinking, 'Something great surely has he become now that he has been consecrated: I fear lest he may rend me asunder!' And he also is afraid of her, thinking, 'I fear lest she may shake me off.' Hence he thereby enters into a friendly relation with her; for a mother does not injure her son, nor does a son injure his mother: therefore he mutters thus.
4	3	22	He steps down (from the chariot), muttering this atikhandas verse , 'The swan dwelling in the light, the Vasu dwelling in the air, the priest seated on the altar, the guest dwelling in the retreat (house),--the man-dwelling, the space-dwelling , the law-dwelling, the sphere-dwelling, the water-born,cow-born, law-born, rock-born (is) the great .' For that atikhandas (or excessive metre) comprises all the metres: thus evil does not descend along with him.
4	3	23	Let not the charioteer get down along with (or, after) him, lest he should descend on the same world on which the anointed (king) has just descended. They put him up, along with the chariot, on the car-stand. Thence he leaps down: thus he does not descend on the same world on which the anointed has just descended .
4	3	24	North of the Âhavanîya is the original fire, taken up (from the hearth ). Behind the right hind-wheel of the cart-stand he fastens two round satamânas .
4	3	25	He then hides an udumbara (ficus glomerata) branch (in the wheel-track). He touches one of those two (plates), with , 'So great thou art, life thou art: bestow life upon me! A yoke-mate thou art, lustre thou art: bestow lustre upon me!' He thereby takes life and lustre to himself.
4	3	26	He then touches the udumbara branch, with, 'Sustenance thou art: bestow sustenance upon me!' He thereby takes sustenance (strength) to himself. Those same two round satamânas are the fee for this ceremony. He gives them to the Brahman priest, for the Brahman protects the sacrifice from the south: therefore he gives them to the Brahman.
4	3	27	In front of the Maitrâvaruna's hearth the dish of curds for Mitra and Varuna has been deposited. He draws down to it his (the Sacrificer's) two arms , with, 'I draw you down, the arms of Indra, the doer of mighty deeds.' Now curds are the essence of cattle: hence it is to the essence of cattle that he thereby brings down his (the Sacrificer's) arms. And as to its being for Mitra-Varuna, it is because Mitra and Varuna are the two arms.
4	4	1	He proceeds with the curds for Mitra-Varuna. Whilst the Svishtakrit of it remains yet unoffered, they bring a throne-seat for him (the king); for truly he who gains a seat in the air, gains a seat above (others): thus these subjects of his sit below him who is seated above,--that is why they bring him a throne-seat. It is of khadira (acacia catechu) wood, and perforated, and bound with thongs as that of the Bhâratas.
4	4	2	He places it (on the tiger's skin), in front of the Maitrâvaruna's hearth, with , 'Thou art pleasant, thou art soft-seated!'--he thereby renders it kindly and auspicious.
4	4	3	He then spreads a mantle over it, with, 'Thou art the womb (seat) of knighthood!'--he thusmakes it (the king's throne) the very womb of knighthood.
4	4	4	He then makes him sit down on it, with, 'Seat thee on the pleasant one! seat thee on the soft-seated!'--whereby he says, 'Seat thyself on the kindly and auspicious (seat)!'--'Seat thee in the womb of knighthood!'--thus he places him in what is the very womb of knighthood.
4	4	5	Having touched him on the chest, he then mutters , 'He hath sat down, the upholder of the sacred law,'--the king indeed is the upholder of the sacred law, for he is not capable of all and every speech, nor of all and every deed; but that he should speak only what is right, and do what is right, of that he, as well as the Srotriya (the Brâhman versed in sacred writ), is capable; for these two are the upholders of the sacred law among men: therefore he says, 'He hath sat down, the upholder of the sacred law;'--'Varuna, in the home-steads,'--the home-steads are the peasants (clans, people): 'among the peasants' he means to say;--'for supreme rule, he the wise!'--'for kingship' he means to say when he says, 'for supreme rule, he the wise.'
4	4	6	He then throws the five dice  into his hand,with , 'Dominant thou art: may these five regions of thine prosper!'--now thatone, the Kali, is indeed dominant over the (other) dice, for that one dominates over all the dice: therefore he says, 'Dominant thou art: may these five regions of thine prosper!' for there are indeed five regions, and all the regions he thereby causes to prosper for him.
4	4	7	They (the Adhvaryu and his assistants) then silently strike him with sticks on the back;--by beating him with sticks (danda) they guide him safely over judicial punishment (dandabadha): whence the king is exempt from punishment (adandya), because they guide him safely over judicial punishment.
4	4	8	Thereupon he chooses a boon; and, verily, whatsoever boon he who has been anointed chooses, that is completely fulfilled for him: therefore he chooses a boon.
4	4	9	'O Brahman!' thus he addresses (the priest) the first time , thinking, 'I will first utter the (word) Brahman, I will speak speech sped by the Brahman:' this is why he first addresses him with 'O Brahman!' The other answers, 'Thou art Brahman! Thou art Savitri of true impulsion!'--he thereby lays vigour into him, and causes Savitri to be of true impulsion.
4	4	10	'O Brahman!' thus he addresses him the second time. The other answers, 'Thou art Brahman! Thou art Varuna of true power!'--he thereby lays vigour into him, and causes Varuna to be of true power.
4	4	11	'O Brahman!' thus he addresses him the third time. The other answers, 'Thou art Brahman! Thou art Indra, mighty through the people !'--he thereby lays vigour into him, and causes Indra to be mighty through the people.
4	4	12	'O Brahman!' thus he addresses him thefourth time. The other answers, 'Thou art Brahman! Thou art Rudra, the most kindly!'--he thereby lays into him (the king) those former energies, and he appeases him (Rudra); and he, Rudra, therefore, is gracious to every one, because he (the priest) appeases him.
4	4	13	'O Brahman!' thus he addresses him the fifth time. The other answers (undefinedly), 'Thou art Brahman!'--undefined means unlimited: thus heretofore he laid limited vigour into him; but now he answers undefinedly; and undefined meaning unlimited, he thereby lays complete, unlimited vigour into him: therefore he answers here undefinedly.
4	4	14	He then hails him as one bearing auspicious names,--'Much-worker, better-worker, more-worker !' Whoever bears such names speaks auspiciously even with a human voice.
4	4	15	A Brâhmana then hands to him the sacrificial (wooden) sword,--either the Adhvaryu, or he who is his (the king's) domestic chaplain--with, 'Indra's thunderbolt thou art: therewith serve me!'--the sacrificial sword being a thunderbolt, that Brâhmana, by means of that thunderbolt, makes the king to be weaker than himself; for indeed the king who is weaker than a Brâhmana, is stronger than his enemies: thus he thereby makes him stronger than his enemies.
4	4	16	The king hands it to the king's brother, with, 'Indra's thunderbolt thou art: therewith serve me!' Thereby the king makes his brother to be weaker than himself.
4	4	17	The king's brother hands it either to the Sûta (minstrel and chronicler), or to the Governor, with, 'Indra's thunderbolt thou art: therewith serve me!' Thereby the king's brother makes the Sûta, or the Governor, to be weaker than himself.
4	4	18	The Sûta, or the Governor, hands it to the Grâmanî (village-headman ), with, 'Indra's thunderbolt thou art: therewith serve me!' Thereby the Sûta, or the Governor, makes the headman to be weaker than himself.
4	4	19	The Grâmanî hands it to a tribesman , with, 'Indra's thunderbolt thou art: therewith serve me!' Thereby the headman makes the tribesman to be weaker than himself. And as to why they mutually hand it on in this way, they do so lest there should be a confusion of classes, and in order that (society) may be in the proper order.
4	4	20	Thereupon the tribesman and the Pratiprasthâtri , with that sacrificial sword, prepare the gaming-ground, (close) by the original fire , with the puroruk verse of the Sukra . The Sukra is the eater: he thereby makes (him) the eater.
4	4	21	With the puroruk verse of the Manthin  they then put up a shed (vimita). The Manthin cup ishe that is to be eaten,--thus having first made (him) the feeder, they now make for him one to be fed upon: that is why they put up a shed with the puroruk verse of the Manthin cup.
4	4	22	The Adhvaryu then takes clarified butter in four ladlings, places a piece of gold on the gaming-ground, and offers with , 'May ample Agni, the lord of rites, delighted,--may ample Agni, the lord of rites, accept of the butter, hail!'
4	4	23	He (the Adhvaryu) throws down the dice, with, 'Hallowed by Svâhâ, strive ye with Sûrya's rays for the middlemost place among brethren!' For that gaming-ground is the same as 'ample Agni,' and those dice are his coals, thus it is him (Agni) he thereby pleases; and assuredly in the house of him who offers the Râgasûya, or who so knows this, the striking  of that cow is approved of. On those dice he says, 'Play for the cow!' The two draught oxen of the original (hall-door) fire are the sacrificial fee.
4	4	24	He then says, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni Svishtakrit!' And as to why that ceremony is performed between two oblations,--verily, Pragâpati is that sacrifice which is here performed, and from which these creatures have been produced,--and, indeed, they are even now produced after this one;--thus he places him (the Sacrificer) in the very middle of that Pragâpati, and consecrates him in the very middle: that is why that ceremony is performed between two oblations. Having called for the Sraushat, he says, 'Pronounce the offering-formula to Agni Svishtakrit,' and offers as the Vashat is uttered.
4	4	25	He then puts the idâ on (the fire). After the invocation of Idâ, he touches water and draws the Mâhendra cup. Having drawn the Mâhendra cup, he sets the chant agoing. He urges him (the Sacrificer) forward to the chant: he gets down (from the throne-seat); he is in attendance at the chant (stotra), in attendance at the recitation (sastra).
4	5	1	Now when Varuna was consecrated, his lustre departed from him,--lustre means vigour: that Vishnu, the Sacrifice, it was he that departed from him,--probably that collected essence of the waters wherewith he is anointed on that occasion, drove out his lustre.
4	5	2	He stole after it with those deities ,--with Savitri, the impeller (prasavitri); with Sarasvatî, speech; with Tvashtri, the forms of being; with Pûshan, cattle; with Indra, on the part of him  (the Sacrificer); with Brihaspati, holiness; with Varuna, might; with Agni, fiery spirit; with Soma, the King; --but only through Vishnu , the tenth deity, he found it.
4	5	3	And because he there stole after (anu-sam-srip) with those deities, hence the name Samsripah. And because he becomes consecrated on the tenth day, therefore (this ceremony is called) Dasapeya . And because each time ten (men) steal along  after each cup, therefore also it is called Dasapeya.
4	5	4	Here now they say,--'Let him steal forth after enumerating ten Soma-drinking grandfathers : it is thus that he obtains for himself the Soma-draught of this (Dasapeya), for it is a "drinking of ten."' But that is an overburdening , for people (willbe able to) obtain only two or three Soma-drinking grandfathers: hence let him steal forth after enumerating those same deities .
4	5	5	For, surely, it was by those same deities that Varuna obtained the Soma-draught of that (Consecration-ceremony); and in like manner does this one now obtain the Soma-draught of that (ceremony): let him therefore steal forth after enumerating those same deities. Now as soon as the completing oblation  of that Consecration-ceremony comes to an end,--
4	5	6	He prepares those (samsrip) oblations,--a cake on twelve, or eight, potsherds for Savitri; for Savitri is the impeller of the gods: impelled by Savitri, Varuna on that occasion stole along; and in like manner does this one now steal along impelled by Savitri. At this (oblation) he presents one lotus-flower .
4	5	7	He then prepares a (rice) pap for Sarasvatî,--for Sarasvatî is speech, and it was with speech that Varuna on that occasion stole along; and in like manner does this one now steal along with speech. At this (oblation) he presents one lotus-flower.
4	5	8	He then prepares a cake on ten potsherds for Tvashtri,--for Tvashtri (the fashioner, creator) rules over living forms, and with Tvashtri, the living forms, Varuna on that occasion stole along; and inlike manner does this one now steal along with Tvashtri, the living forms. At this (oblation) he presents one lotus-flower.
4	5	9	He then prepares a pap for Pûshan;--for Pûshan is cattle, and with cattle Varuna on that occasion stole along; and in like manner does this one now steal along with cattle. At this (oblation) he presents one lotus-flower.
4	5	10	He then prepares a cake on eleven potsherds for Indra;--for Indriya means energy, vigour, and with vigour Varuna on that occasion stole along; and in like manner does this one now steal along with energy, with vigour. At this (oblation) he presents one lotus-flower.
4	5	11	He then prepares a pap for Brihaspati;--for Brihaspati means holiness, and with holiness Varuna on that occasion stole along; and in likes manner does this one now steal along with holiness. At this (oblation) he presents one lotus-flower.
4	5	12	He then prepares a barley pap for Varuna;--with what vehemence Varuna seized the creatures, with that vehemence Varuna on that occasion stole along; and in like manner does this one now steal along with vehemence. At this (oblation) he presents one lotus-flower.
4	5	13	The deities of the Upasad are the (eighth, ninth, and) tenth . At these (oblations) he presentsfive lotus-flowers. That wreath of twelve lotus-flowers he puts on himself; that is the initiation: by that initiation he initiates himself.
4	5	14	And as to why there are twelve (flowers),--there being twelve months in the year, and the year being All, it is by the All that he thus initiates him: what flowers there are of the lotus, they are a form (an image) of the sky, they are a form of the stars; and what seed-stalks there are, they are a form of the air; and what suckers there are, they are a form of this (earth): thus he initiates him (to rule) over these worlds.
4	5	15	And having bought the King (Soma) , andtied him up in two parts, they drive him around. Having then placed one-half on the throne-seat, he proceeds therewith. Having then placed on the throne-seat that portion which was deposited in the Brahman's house, he proceeds with the guest-meal. Whilst he is proceeding with the guest-meal, he performs the Upasads. Whilst he is performing the Upasads,--
4	5	16	He prepares those (three) oblations,--a cake on eight potsherds for Agni; a pap for Soma; and a cake on three potsherds, or a pap, for Vishnu. Thus he performs the sacrifice in this way, if it pleases him.
4	5	17	But let him not do it in this way; for he who departs from the path of the sacrifice stumbles, and he who departs from the path of the Upasads certainly departs from the path of the sacrifice: let him therefore not depart from the path of the Upasads.
4	5	18	Now when he offers to Agni, he steals along with Agni, with fiery spirit; and when he offers to Soma, he steals along with Soma, the King; and when he offers to Vishnu,--Vishnu being the sacrifice,--he visibly obtains the sacrifice, and having visibly obtained it, he makes it his own (or, takes it in).
4	5	19	This same (Dasapeya) is an Agnishtoma sacrifice (performed) with the seventeenfold (stoma)  for Pragâpati is seventeenfold, and Pragâpati is thesacrifice : thus he visibly obtains the sacrifice, and having visibly obtained it, he makes it his own.
4	5	20	Twelve heifers with first calf are the sacrificial fee for this (sacrifice); for twelve months there are in the year, and the year is Pragâpati, and Pragâpati is the sacrifice: thus he visibly obtains the sacrifice, and having visibly obtained it, he makes it his own.
4	5	21	These (heifers) have twelve embryo calves,--that makes twenty-four; for twenty-four half-moons there are in the year, and the year is Pragâpati, and Pragâpati is the sacrifice: thus he visibly obtains the sacrifice, and having visibly obtained it, he makes it his own.
4	5	22	He gives them to the Brahman, for the Brahman guards the sacrifice from the south: therefore he gives them to the Brahman. To the Udgâtri (chanter) he gives the gold wreath, to the Hotri the gold plate, to the two Adhvaryus two golden mirrors, to the Prastotri () a horse, to the Maitrâvaruna a sterile cow, to the Brâhmanâkhamsin a bull, to the Neshtri and Potri two garments, to the Akhâvâka (a cart) laden with barley, and yoked (with an ox) on one side, to the Agnîdh an ox .
4	5	23	Now there are here either twelve or thirteen  presents,--for either twelve or thirteen are there months in the year, and the year is Pragâpati, and Pragâpati is the sacrifice: thus he visibly obtains the sacrifice, and having visibly obtained it he makes it his own.
5	1	1	There is a cake on eight potsherds for Agni: this he places on the eastern part (of the Vedi). There is either a cake on eleven potsherds for Indra, or a rice-pap for Soma: this he places on the southern part. There is a pap for the Visve Devâh (All-gods): this he places on the western part. There is a dish of curds for Mitra-Varuna: this he places on the north part. There is a pap for Brihaspati: this he places in the middle. This is the five-holed pap ;--what five sacrificial dishes (havis) there are, for them there are five holes: hence the name 'five-holed pap.'
5	1	2	And as to why the performer of the Râgasûya should perform this offering: because he (the priest) makes him ascend the regions, the seasons, the hymns and metres, he now redeems him therefrom by this (offering). But were the performer of the Râgasûya not to perform this offering, then verily he would become intoxicated (with pride)  and would fall down headlong: that is why the performer of the Râgasûya performs this offering.
5	1	3	And why he proceeds with the cake on eightpotsherds for Agni,--because he makes him ascend the eastern region, the seasons, the hymns and metres, he now redeems him therefrom by this (oblation). The remains of it he pours on the Brihaspati pap.
5	1	4	And why he proceeds with the cake on eleven potsherds for Indra, or with the pap for Soma,--because he makes him ascend the southern region, the seasons, the hymns and metres, he now redeems him therefrom by this (oblation). The remains he pours on the Brihaspati pap.
5	1	5	And why he proceeds with the pap to the All-gods,--because he makes him ascend the eastern region, the seasons, the hymns and metres, he now redeems him therefrom by this (oblation). The remains he pours on the Brihaspati pap.
5	1	6	And why he proceeds with the dish of curds for Mitra-Varuna,--because he makes him ascend the northern region, the seasons, the hymns and metres, he now redeems him therefrom by this (oblation). The remains he pours on the Brihaspati pap. And in that he pours those remains on the Brihaspati pap, he thereby bestows food upon him  (the Sacrificer); and hence food is brought to the king from every quarter.
5	1	7	And why he proceeds with the Brihaspati pap,--because he makes him ascend the upper region, the seasons, the hymns and metres, he now redeems him therefrom by this (oblation).
5	1	8	And what cake on eight potsherds there is for Agni, the priest's fee for that is gold; for that offering is for Agni, and gold is Agni's seed: thereforethe fee is gold. He gives it to the Agnîdh; for he, the Âgnîdhra, is really the same as Agni: therefore he gives it to the Agnîdh.
5	1	9	And what cake on eleven potsherds there is for Indra, the fee for that is a bull, for the bull is Indra. And if there be a pap for Soma, then the fee for that is a brown ox, for the brown one is sacred to Soma. He gives it to the Brahman, for the Brahman guards the sacrifice from the south: therefore he gives it to the Brahman.
5	1	10	And what pap there is for the All-gods, the fee for that is a piebald bullock; for abundance of forms (marks) there is in such a piebald bullock, and the Visve Devâh are the clans, and the clans mean abundance: therefore a piebald bullock is the fee. He gives it to the Hotri, for the Hotri means abundance: therefore he gives it to the Hotri.
5	1	11	And what dish of curds there is for Mitra-Varuna, the fee for that is a sterile cow, for that one is sacred to Mitra-Varuna. If he cannot procure a sterile cow, any unimpregnated one will do; for every sterile cow is indeed unimpregnated. He gives it to the two Adhvaryus; for the Adhvaryus are the out-breathing and the in-breathing, and the out-breathing and in-breathing are Mitra-Varuna: therefore he gives it to the two Adhvaryus.
5	1	12	And what pap there is for Brihaspati, the fee for that is a white-backed bullock; for to Brihaspati belongs that upper region , and above that there is that path of Aryaman : therefore a white-backed (bullock) is the fee for the Brihaspati (pap). He gives it to the Brahman, for Brihaspati is the Brahman of the gods, and this one is his (the Sacrificer's) Brahman: therefore he gives it to the Brahman. Even a vishthâvrâgin  who is desirous of food may perform this offering: he (the priest) thereby bestows food upon him from all quarters, and verily he becomes an eater of food.
5	2	1	He performs the oblations of teams (prayugâm havîmshi). The reason why he performs the oblations of teams, is that the anointed thereby yokes the seasons, and thus yoked those seasons draw him along, and he follows the seasons thus yoked: therefore he performs the oblations of teams.
5	2	2	There are twelve of these (oblations), for there are twelve months in the year: that is why there are twelve. 'Let him make offering month by month,' they say. Who knows about (the life of) man ? Let him therefore not make offering month by month. Moving eastward he offers six of them each at the distance of the yoke-pin's throw from the other ; and then turning backward he offers six, each at a yoke-pin's throw from the other.
5	2	3	But let him not do it thus. He prepares those first six so as to have a common barhis , after the manner of those deities (of the first six oblations); even as in early spring they  would yoke their team and go onward until the rainy season, so does he now yoke the six seasons, and thus yoked the six seasons draw him forward and he follows the six seasons thus yoked until the rainy season. Two of the (oxen) drawing the original (hall-door) fire are the sacrificial fee.
5	2	4	He prepares the last six oblations so as to have a common barhis, after the manner of those (six) deities. Even as they would return again towards the rainy season, so does he yoke the six seasons, and thus yoked the six seasons draw him towards the rainy season, and he follows the six seasons thus yoked, in the rainy season. Two of the (oxen) drawing the original fire are the sacrificial fee. And as to why the (oxen) drawing the original fire are the sacrificial fee,--the consecrated (king) now yokes the seasons, and it being oxen that (actually) draw (and thus represent the seasons), therefore the (oxen) drawing the original fire are the sacrificial fee.
5	2	5	Now as to this the Kurupañkâlas used formerly to say, 'It is the seasons that, being yoked, draw us, and we follow the seasons thus yoked.' It was because their kings were performers of the Râgasûya that they spake thus.
5	2	6	There is a cake on eight potsherds for Agni, a pap for Soma, a cake on twelve or eight potsherds for Savitri, a pap for Brihaspati, a cake on ten potsherds for Tvashtri, and one on twelve potsherds for (Agni) Vaisvânara--these are the first six oblations.
5	2	7	The six last are paps,--a pap for Sarasvatî, a pap for Pûshan, a pap for Mitra, a pap for Kshetrapati (the Landlord or Lord of the manor), a pap for Varuna, and a pap for Aditi,--these are the last six paps.
5	2	8	Thereupon they seize  a reddish-white (cow) which is clearly with calf, (as a victim) for Aditi. The mode of procedure regarding her is the same as that of the eight-footed barren cow . Now, Aditi being this earth, it is her embryo (child) he thereby causes him (the king) to be. The sacrificial fee for this (cow-offering) is just such a reddish-white cow that is clearly with calf.
5	2	9	They then seize a dappled one, which is clearly with calf, (as a victim) for the Maruts. The mode of procedure regarding this one is the same. The Maruts being the clans, he thereby makes him the embryo  of the clans. The sacrificial fee for this (cow-offering) is just such a dappled (cow) that is clearly with calf.
5	2	10	These two animal victims, whilst being such, are seized (by some) in a different way. The one that is seized for Aditi, (some) seize for the Âdityas,--the Âdityas being the All, he (the priest) thereby makes him the embryo of the All (universe). And the one that is seized for the Maruts, (some) seize for the All-gods,--the All-gods being the All, he thereby makes him the embryo of the All.
5	3	1	When he has performed the Consecration-ceremony (Abhishekanîya), he does not shave his hair. The reason why he does not shave his hair (is this):--that collected essence of the waters wherewith he is then sprinkled (anointed) is vigour, and it is the hair (of his head) that it reaches first when he is sprinkled; hence were he to shave his hair, he would cause that glory to fall off from him, and would sweep it away: therefore he does not shave his hair.
5	3	2	He does not shave his hair for a year ,--religious observance is of equal measure with the year, hence he does not shave for a year: the Kesavapanîya , namely, is a (day of) praise-singing (stoma) with the view of the termination of the religious performance.
5	3	3	Twenty-onefold is (each stotra of) its Morning-service, seventeenfold (of) the Midday-service, fifteen-fold (of) the Evening-service, together with the Uktha (stotras), the Shodasin, and (the twelve stotras of) the Night-service.
5	3	4	The Twilight (hymn)  is (performed in the) Trivrit (stoma), and with the Rathantara (tune). For the twenty-onefold (stoma) is he that burns yonder (the sun); from that twenty-onefold one he (the Sacrificer) parts, and descends again to the seventeenfold one; from the seventeenfold one to thefifteenfold one; and from the fifteenfold one he plants his foot on this firm footing, the Trivrit (stoma).
5	3	5	The Rathantara is the Prishtha (stotra)  of this (sacrifice); for the Rathantara is this (earth): it is on her, as on a firm footing, he thereby plants his feet. It is an Atirâtra (sacrifice),--the Atirâtra is a firm footing: therefore it is an Atirâtra.
5	3	6	He only cuts down his hair, but does not shave it; for that collected essence of the waters with which he is sprinkled is vigour, and it is the hair that it reaches first when he is sprinkled. Thus were he to shave off his hair he would cause that glory to fall off from him, and would sweep it away. But when he cuts it down, he attaches that glory to his own self: therefore he only cuts down his hair, but does not shave it. This is for him a religious observance: as long as he lives he does not stand on this (earth with bare feet ).
5	3	7	From the throne-seat he slips into the shoes; and on shoes (he stands), whatever his vehicle may be, whether a chariot or anything else. For verily he who performs the Râgasûya is high above everything here, and everything here is beneath him;--therefore this is for him a religious observance: as longas he lives he does not stand on the earth (with bare feet).
5	4	1	There is a reddish-white (he-goat as the victim) for the Asvins , for the Asvins are reddish-white. There is an ewe with teats in the dewlap  for Sarasvatî; and a bull he seizes for Indra Sutrâman (the good protector) . Difficult to obtain are beasts with such perfections; if he cannot obtain anywith such perfections, they may slaughter only goats, for they are easier to cook. And if they seize only goats, that for the Asvins is a red one. Then as to why he performs this sacrifice.
5	4	2	Now Tvashtri had a three-headed, six-eyed son . He had three mouths; and because he was thus shapen, he was called Visvarûpa ('All-shape').
5	4	3	One of his mouths was Soma-drinking, one spirit-drinking, and one for other food. Indra hated him, and cut off those heads of his.
5	4	4	And from the one which was Soma-drinking, a hazel-cock sprang forth; whence the latter is of brownish colour, for king Soma is brown.
5	4	5	And from the one which was spirit-drinking, a sparrow sprang; whence the latter talks like one who is joyful, for when one has drunk spirits, one talks as one who enjoys himself.
5	4	6	And from the one which was for other (kinds of) food, a partridge sprang; whence the latter is exceedingly variegated: ghee drops indeed have, as it were, dropped on his wings in one place, and honey-drops, as it were, in another; for suchlike was the-food he consumed with that (mouth).
5	4	7	Tvashtri was furious: 'Has he really slain my son?' He brought Soma juice withheld from Indra ; and as that Soma-juice was, when produced, even so it remained withheld from Indra.
5	4	8	Indra thought within himself: 'There now, they are excluding me from Soma!' and even uninvited he consumed what pure (Soma) there was in the tub, as the stronger (would consume the food) of the weaker. But it hurt him: it flowed in all directions from (the openings of) his vital airs; only from his mouth it did not flow. Hence there was an atonement; but had it flown also from his mouth, then indeed there would have been no atonement.
5	4	9	For there are four castes, the Brâhmana, the Râganya, the Vaisya, and the Sûdra; but there is not one of them that vomits Soma; but were there any one of them, then indeed there would be atonement.
5	4	10	From what flowed from the nose a lion sprang; and from what flowed from the ears a wolf sprang; and from what flowed from the lower opening wild beasts sprang, with the tiger as their foremost; and what flowed from the upper opening that was the foaming spirit (parisrut). And thrice he spit out: thence were produced the (fruits called) 'kuvala, karkandhu, or badara .' He (Indra) became emptied out of everything, for Soma is everything.
5	4	11	Being thus purged by Soma, he walked about as one tottering. The Asvins cured him by this (offering), and caused him to be supplied with everything, for Soma is everything. By offering he indeed became better.
5	4	12	The gods spake, 'Aha! these two have saved him , the well-saved (sutrâta):' hence the name Sautrâmanî.
5	4	13	Let him also cure by this (ceremony) one purged by Soma;--he whom Soma purges is indeed emptied out of everything, for Soma is everything. He now causes him to be supplied with everything, for Soma is everything; and by offering he indeed becomes better: let him therefore cure thereby also one purged by Soma.
5	4	14	And as to why the performer of the Râgasûya performs this offering. He who performs the Râgasûya assuredly gains for himself all sacrificial rites, all offerings, even the spoonful-oblations; and instituted by the gods indeed is this offering, the Sautrâmanî: 'May offering be made by me with this one also! may I be consecrated by this one also!' thus (he thinks, and) therefore the performer of the Râgasûya performs this offering.
5	4	15	And as to why there is (a victim) for the Asvins,--it was the Asvins who cured him; and in like manner does he (the priest) now cure him through those same Asvins: that is why there is (a victim) for the Asvins.
5	4	16	And why there is one for Sarasvatî,--Sarasvatî assuredly is speech, and it was by speech that the Asvins cured him; and in like manner does he now cure him by speech: that is why there is one for Sarasvatî.
5	4	17	And why there is one for Indra,--Indra assuredly is the deity of the sacrifice, and it is by this (offering) that he now heals him: this is why there is one for Indra.
5	4	18	On (the meat-portions of) those victims he throws hairs of a lion, hairs of a wolf, and hairs of a tiger, for that was what sprang therefrom, when Soma flowed right through him. He now supplieshim therewith, and makes him whole: therefore he throws those (hairs) thereon.
5	4	19	But let him not do it so; for he who throws them on the (portions of) the victims, urges the animals on from behind with a clawed (prickly) fire-brand. Let him therefore rather throw them into the fermented liquor (parisrut ),--thus he does not urge on the animals from behind with a clawed fire-brand; and thus alone he supplies him therewith, and makes him whole: let him therefore throw it rather into the spirituous liquor.
5	4	20	Now on the day before, he mixes the spirituous liquor  he proceeds with that (offering).
5	4	21	They take up two fires; on the northern altar  (they lay down) the northern (fire), and on a raised (mound) the southern one, thinking, 'Lest we should offer together the Soma-libations, and the Surâ (liquor) -libations:' therefore they take up two fires, and on the northern altar (they lay down) the northern (fire), and on a raised (mound) the southern one. And when he proceeds with the omenta, then he proceeds with that spirituous liquor.
5	4	22	He purifies it with stalks of Darbha-grass, thinking, 'Let it be pure,'--with , 'The inviting  Soma, purified by the purifying (strainer), has overflown backwards, Indra's mated friend.' He then pours in flour of 'kuvala, karkandhu, and badara' berries, for when he (Indra) spit out thrice, that was what was produced therefrom: therewith he now supplies him and makes him whole,--therefore he pours in that (flour).
5	4	23	He then draws either one or three cups ,--but only one should be drawn, for there is one puroruk-formula, one invitatory prayer, and one offering prayer; therefore only one (cup) should be drawn.
5	4	24	He draws it with , 'Yea, even as the owners of barley cut their barley, spreading it asunder in due order, so hither, hither, bring thou the nourishments of them that offer up the devotional invocation of the Barhis !--Thou art taken with a support--thee for the Asvins, thee for Sarasvatî, thee for Indra, the good protector!' And if he draw three (cups), let him draw them with that same (verse); but let him in that case draw them with separate 'supports .' He then says, 'Recite theinvitatory prayer to the Asvins, to Sarasvatî, and to Indra Sutrâman!'
5	4	25	He recites , 'Ye, O Asvins, lords of splendour, having quaffed the cheering (Soma) together with Namuki, the Âsura, helped Indra in his deeds!' Having called for the , he says, 'Pronounce the offering prayer to the Asvins, to Sarasvatî, and to Indra Sutrâman!'
5	4	26	He prays , 'As the parents (stand by) their son, so the two Asvins have stood by thee, O Indra, with wise plans and wonderful deeds; when thou quaffedst the cheering (Soma), Sarasvatî cured thee, O Lord, by her services.' Twice the Hotri utters the Vashat, twice the Adhvaryu offers and fetches drink. And if he draw three (cups of liquor), then after the offering of that one the other two are offered.
5	4	27	Now there is a pitcher perforated either with a hundred, or with nine, holes. If it is one with a hundred holes,--man lives up to a hundred (years), and has a hundred energies, and a hundred powers: therefore it is perforated with a hundred holes. And if with nine holes,--there are in man those nine vital airs: therefore it is perforated with nine holes.
5	4	28	This (pitcher), hung up by a sling, they hold just over the Âhavanîya . He pours into it what spirituous liquor has been left over, and whilst it istrickling through, he stands by worshipping with the three verses  of the Pitarah Somavantah (the Fathers accompanied by Soma), with three verses of the Pitaro Barishadah (the Fathers seated on the barhis), and with three verses of the Pitaro Agnishvâttâh (the Fathers consumed by the fire). And as to why he thus stands by worshipping,--when Soma flowed through Indra, what part of it then went to the Fathers--there being three kinds of Fathers--therewith he now supplies him and makes him whole: therefore he thus stands by worshipping.
5	4	29	He then prepares those oblations ,--a cake on twelve or eight potsherds for Savitri, a barley pap for Varuna, and a cake on eleven potsherds for Indra.
5	4	30	And why there is one for Savitri,--Savitri is the impeller of the gods, and impelled by Savitri he now heals : therefore there is one for Savitri.
5	4	31	And why there is one for Varuna,--Varuna is the injurer, and he thus heals him even by him who is the injurer: therefore there is one for Varuna.
5	4	32	And why there is one for Indra,--Indra is the deity of the sacrifice, and he thus heals him by him who is the deity of the sacrifice: therefore there is one for Indra.
5	4	33	And if by that (Sautrâmanî-offering) he would heal one purged by Soma , then--(after) the after-offering (of the animal sacrifice) has been performed, and the two spoons separated--he proceeds with those (three) oblations . For it is towards the back part that Soma flows through, and at the back part (of the sacrifice) he thus closes him up by that sacrificial essence. Let him in that case prepare a cake on two potsherds for the Asvins; and when he proceeds with the offering of the omenta, then he also proceeds with that two-kapâla cake for the Asvins.
5	4	34	Let him, however, not do it in this way; for verily whosoever departs from the path of the sacrifice stumbles, and he who does this indeed departs from the path of the sacrifice. Hence at the very time when they proceed with the omenta of those victims, let them then proceed also with those (three) oblations, and let him not then prepare a two-kapâla cake for the Asvins.
5	4	35	A castrated bull is the sacrificial fee for this (sacrifice);--the castrated bull is neither female nor male; for being a male it is not a female, and being a female (unmanned) it is not a male: therefore a castrated bull is the fee. Or a draught-mare;--the draught-mare is neither male nor female; for in that it pulls the cart it is not a female; and being a female, it is not a male: therefore a draught-mare (may be) the fee.
5	5	1	He prepares a cake on twelve potsherds for Indra and Vishnu. Now as to why he makes this offering. Of old, everything here was within Vritra, to wit, the Rik, the Yagus, and the Sâman. Indra wished to hurl the thunderbolt at him.
5	5	2	He said to Vishnu, 'I will hurl the thunderbolt at Vritra, stand thou by me!'--'So be it!' said Vishnu, 'I will stand by thee: hurl it!' Indra aimed the thunderbolt at him. Vritra was afraid of the raised thunderbolt.
5	5	3	He said, 'There is here a (source of) strength: I will give that up to thee; but do not smite me!' and gave up to him the Yagus-formulas. He (Indra) aimed at him a second time.
5	5	4	He said, 'There is here a (source of) strength: I will give that up to thee; but do not smite me!' and gave up to him the Rik-verses. He aimed at him a third time.
5	5	5	'There is here a (source of) strength: I will give that up to thee; but do not smite me!' and gave up to him the Sâman-hymns (or tunes). Therefore they spread the sacrifice even to this day in the same way with those (three) Vedas, first with the Yagus-formulas, then with the Rik-verses, and then with the Sâman-hymns; for thus he (Vritra) at that time gave them up to him.
5	5	6	And that which had been his (Vritra's) seat, his retreat, that he shattered, grasping it and tearing it out : it became this offering. And because the science (the Veda) that lay in that retreat was, as it were, a threefold (tridhâtu) one, therefore this is called the Traidhâtavî (ishti).
5	5	7	And as to why the oblation is one for Indra and Vishnu, it is because Indra raised the thunderbolt, and Vishnu stood by him.
5	5	8	And why it is (a cake) on twelve potsherds,--there are twelve months in the year, and the offering is of equal measure with the year: therefore it is one of twelve potsherds.
5	5	9	He prepares it of both rice and barley. He first puts on (the fire) a ball of rice, that being a form (symbol) of the Yagus-formulas; then one of barley, that being a form of the Rik-verses; then one of rice, that being a form of the Sâman-hymns. Thus this is made to be a form of the triple science: and this same (offering) becomes the Udavasânîyâ-ishti (completing oblation) for the performer of the Râgasûya.
5	5	10	For, verily, he who performs the Râgasûya gains for himself (the benefit of) all sacrificial rites, all offerings, even the spoonful-oblations; for him the sacrifice becomes as it were exhausted, and he, as it were, turns away from it. Now the whole sacrifice is just as great as that triple Veda; and this (offering) now is made a form of that (Veda, orsacrifice); this is its womb, its seat: thus he commences once more the sacrifice by means of that triple Veda; and thus his sacrifice is not exhausted, and he does not turn away from it.
5	5	11	And, verily, he who performs the Râgasûya gains for himself all sacrificial rites, all offerings, even the spoonful-oblations; and this offering, the Traidhâtavî (ishti), is instituted by the gods: 'May this offering also be performed by me, may I be consecrated by this one also!' thus he thinks, and therefore this is the completing offering for him who performs the Râgasûya.
5	5	12	And also for him who would give (to the priests) a thousand (cows) or more , let this be the completing offering. For he who gives a thousand or more becomes as it were emptied out; and that triple Veda is the thousandfold progeny of Vâk (speech): him who was emptied out he thus fills up again with a thousand; and therefore let it be for him also the completing offering.
5	5	13	And also for those who would sit through (perform) a long sacrificial session , for a year or more, let this be the completing offering. For by those who sit through a long sacrificial session, for a year or more, everything is obtained, everything conquered; but this (offering) is everything: let it therefore be for them also the completing offering.
5	5	14	And indeed one may also practise magic by this (offering); for it was thereby that Ârani bewitched Bhadrasena Âgâtasatrava : 'Quick, then, spread (the barhis)!' thus Yâgñavalkya used to say. And by this (offering) indeed Indra also shattered Vritra's retreat; and, verily, he who therewith practises magic shatters thereby the retreat (of his enemy): therefore one may also practise magic with this (offering).
5	5	15	And, indeed, one may also heal thereby; for, verily, whomsoever one would heal by a single rik, by a single yagus, by a single sâman, him he would indeed render free from disease; how much more so by the triple Veda! Therefore one may also heal by this (offering).
5	5	16	Three gold pieces of a hundred mânas  each are the sacrificial fee for this (offering). He presents them to the Brahman; for the Brahman neither performs (like the Adhvaryu), nor chants (like the Udgâtri), nor recites (like the Hotri), and yet he is an object of respect. And with gold they do nothing , and yet it is an object of respect: therefore he presents to the Brahman three gold pieces of a hundred mânas each.
5	5	17	Three milch cows (he gives) to the Hotri;--for three milch cows mean abundance, and the Hotri means abundance: therefore (he gives) three milch cows to the Hotri.
5	5	18	Three garments (he gives) to the Adhvaryu;--for the Adhvaryu 'spreads' the sacrifice, and the garments spread themselves (over the body) : therefore (he gives) three garments to the Adhvaryu. A bullock (he gives) to the Agnîdh .
5	5	19	Now there are here either twelve, or thirteen gifts , and there are either twelve or thirteen months in the year;--the offering thus is of equal measure with the year: that is why there are either twelve or thirteen sacrificial gifts.
