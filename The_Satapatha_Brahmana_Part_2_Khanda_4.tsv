1	1	1	The Upâmsu (graha), forsooth, is the out-breathing of the Sacrifice , the Upâmsu-savana (press-stone) the through-breathing, and the Antaryâma (graha) the in-breathing.
1	1	2	Now as to why it is called Upâmsu. There is a graha called Amsu , that is Pragâpati: his out-breathing is this (graha); and because it is his out-breathing, therefore it is called Upâmsu.
1	1	3	This (graha) he draws without a strainer : whereby he puts the out-breathing into him as one tending away from him, and thus this forward-tending out-breathing of his streams forth from him. He purifies it with sprigs of Soma, thinking 'it shall be pure.' He purifies it with six (sprigs), for there are six seasons: it is by means of the seasons that he thus purifies it.
1	1	4	As to this they say, 'When he purifies the Upâmsu by means of sprigs, and all (other) Soma-draughtsare purified by means of a strainer, whereby, then, do its sprigs become pure?'
1	1	5	He throws them down again (on the unpressed plants) with , 'What inviolable, quickening name is thine, to that Soma of thine, O Soma, be Hail!' Thus his sprigs become purified by means of the Svâhâ ('Hail!'). But this graha means everything, for it is the type of all the pressings .
1	1	6	Now, once on a time, the gods, while performing sacrifice, were afraid of an attack from the Asura-Rakshas. They said, 'Let us completely establish the sacrifice: if the Asura-Rakshas should then attack us, our sacrifice will at least be completely established.'
1	1	7	Even at the morning Soma-feast they then completely established the entire sacrifice ,--at this same (upâmsu) graha by means of the Yagus; at the first chant (stotra) by means of the Sâman; and at the first recitation (sastra) by means of the Rik: with that sacrifice thus completely established they subsequently worshipped. And in like manner does this sacrifice now become completely established,--by means of the Yagus at this same graha; by means of the Sâman at the first chant; and by means of the Rik at the first recitation; and with this sacrifice thus completely established he subsequently worships.
1	1	8	He presses (the Soma) eight times; for of eightsyllables consists the Gâyatrî, and the morning Soma-feast belongs to the Gâyatrî; thus this (first turn of pressing) is made to be the morning Soma-feast.
1	1	9	He draws (the juice of the first turn of pressing into the cup) with , 'Grow thou pure for Vâkaspati!' for Vâkaspati (lord of speech) is the out-breathing, and this (Upâmsu) graha is the out-breathing: hence he says, 'Grow thou pure for Vâkaspati!'--'purified by the hands with the sprigs of the bull;' for he purifies it with sprigs of Soma: hence he says, 'with the sprigs of the bull;' and 'purified by the hands (gabhasti-pûta ),' he says; for--'gabhasti' being the same as 'pâni' (hand)--he indeed purifies it with his hands.
1	1	10	He then presses eleven times; for of eleven syllables consists the Trishtubh, and the midday Soma-feast belongs to the Trishtubh: thus this (second turn of pressing) is made to be the midday Soma-feast.
1	1	11	He draws (the juice into the cup) with, 'Grow thou pure, a god, for the gods--;' for he (Soma) is indeed a god, and for the gods he becomes pure;--'whose portion thou art;' for he indeed is their portion.
1	1	12	He then presses twelve times; for of twelve syllables consists the Gagatî, and the evening Soma-feast belongs to the Gagatî: thus this (third turn of pressing) is made to be the evening Soma-feast.
1	1	13	He draws (the juice) with, 'Make thou our draughts sweet!' whereby he imbues him (Soma) with sap, and renders him palatable for the gods: hence, when slain, he does not become putrid . And when he offers (that graha) he thereby completely establishes him.
1	1	14	'For one desirous of spiritual lustre (brahmavarkasa) he should press eight times at each (turn),' so they say;--for of eight syllables consists the Gâyatrî, and the Gâyatrî is the Brahman: he indeed becomes endowed with spiritual lustre.
1	1	15	Thus the pressing amounts to twenty-four times (of beating). Now there are twenty-four half-moons in the year; and Pragâpati (the lord of creatures) is the year, and the sacrifice is Pragâpati: thus as great as the sacrifice is, as great as is its measure, so great he thereby establishes it.
1	1	16	'For one desirous of cattle he should press five times at each (turn),' so they say;--the cattle (animal victims) consist of five parts: he indeed gains cattle; and there are five seasons in the year; and Pragâpati is the year, and the sacrifice is Pragâpati thus as great as the sacrifice is, as great as is its measure, so great he thereby establishes it. This, however, is mere speculation: it is the other (manner) which is practised.
1	1	17	Having drawn the graha, he wipes (the vessel) all round, lest any (Soma-juice) should trickle down. He does not deposit it; for this is his out-breathing, whence this out-breathing passes unceasingly. Should he, however, desire to exorcise, he maydeposit it  with, 'I put thee down, the out-breathing of N.N.!' Thus, forsooth, inasmuch as he (the Adhvaryu) does not quit his hold of it, it is not again in that (enemy); and thus both the Adhvaryu and the Sacrificer live long.
1	1	18	Or he may merely cover (the vessel by his hand) with, 'I shut thee off, the out-breathing of N.N.!' Thus, forsooth, inasmuch as he does not deposit it, it is not again in that enemy; and thus he does not disorder the vital airs.
1	1	19	While he is still inside (the Havirdhâna) he utters 'Hail!' For the gods were afraid lest the Asura-Rakshas should destroy what part of this graha was previous to the offering. They offered it (symbolically) by means of the Svâhâ, while they were still inside (the cart-shed), and what was thus offered they afterwards offered up in the fire. And in like manner does he now offer it up by means of the Svâhâ, while he is still inside, and what has thus been offered he afterwards offers up in the fire.
1	1	20	He then walks out (of the Havirdhâna) with, 'I walk along the wide air .' For along the airthe Rakshas roams rootless and unfettered on both sides, even as man here roams along the air, rootless and unfettered on both sides ; and, that formula being the Brahman (prayer), a slayer of the Rakshas, he, by means of that Brahman, renders the air free from danger and injury.
1	1	21	Thereupon he (the Sacrificer) asks a boon. For the gods, forsooth, greatly desire to obtain the offering of that graha, and they grant to him that boon, in order that he may forthwith offer that graha to them: this is why he asks a boon.
1	1	22	He (the Adhvaryu) offers with , 'Self-made thou art,' for, this graha being his (Yagña's) out-breathing, it is indeed made by itself, born of itself : hence he says, 'Self-made thou art;'--'for all powers, divine and earthly,'--for it is born of itself for all creatures ;--'May the mind obtain thee!'--the mind being Pragâpati, he thereby means to say, 'may Pragâpati obtain thee!' 'Hail! thee, O well-born, for Sûrya!' thus he utters the second  (or inferior) 'Hail!' with regard to a subsequent  (or higher; the highest) deity.
1	1	23	Now it is in him that burns yonder (the sun) that he has just offered that (libation); and the latter is the All: hence he makes that (sun) the highest of the All. But were he to utter the second (or higher) 'Hail!' with regard to a preceding (or lower) deity , then it would be even higher than yonder sun: therefore he utters the second 'Hail!' with regard to a subsequent deity.
1	1	24	And, having offered, he wipes the (vessel of the) graha upwards; whereby he puts that out-breathing into him as one tending away from him. Thereupon he rubs (the wiped-off Soma) upon the middle enclosing stick from west to east with the palm of his hand turned upwards --whereby he puts that out-breathing into him as one tending away from him--with, 'Thee to the gods sipping motes of light!'
1	1	25	For in that orb which burns yonder he has just offered this (libation), and those rays thereof are the gods sipping motes of light: it is these he thereby gratifies; and thus gratified those gods convey him to the heavenly world.
1	1	26	For this same graha there is neither an invitatory prayer nor an offering prayer : he offers itwith a (Yagus) formula, and thereby it becomes for him supplied with both an invitatory and an offering prayer. And if he desire to exorcise, let him offer some spray (of Soma) which may adhere either to his arm, or to his breast, or to his garment, with, 'O divine plant, let that be true wherefore I pray thee: let N.N. be struck down by destruction falling from above, crash!' Even as one of (enemies) that are being slain might escape, so does this (sprig) fly away from those that are being pressed: thus nothing (hostile)--either running thither or running away --remains to him for whom he performs this. He deposits that (cup) with, 'Thee for the out-breathing!' for this (graha) indeed is his out-breathing.
1	1	27	Now some deposit it on the south part (of the khara ), for, they say, it is in that direction thatyonder (sun) moves. Let him, however, not do this, but let him deposit it on the north (uttara) part (of the khara), because there is not any higher (uttara) graha than this. He deposits it with, 'Thee for the out-breathing!' for this (graha) is indeed his out-breathing.
1	1	28	He then takes the Upâmsu-savana (pressing-stone). He neither touches it with the fringe nor with the straining-cloth, for that would be like rinsing it in water. If there be any spray adhering to it, let him remove it with his hand, and then lay down (the stone) beside (the Upâmsu cup), with the face towards the north, with, 'Thee for the through-breathing!' for this (stone) is indeed his (Yagña's) through-breathing.
1	2	1	The Upâmsu (graha), forsooth, is his out-breathing, the Upâmsu-savana (stone) his through-breathing,and the Antaryâma (graha) his in-breathing.
1	2	2	Now as to why it is called Antaryâma. That which is the out-breathing is also the in-breathing and the through-breathing. Now, in drawing the Upâmsu (graha), he puts into him that out-breathing which tends away from him; and in drawing the Antaryâma, he puts into him that in-breathing which tends towards him. But this same in-breathing is confined within his self; and because it is confined (yam) within (antar) his self, or because these creatures are sustained (yam) by it, therefore it is called Antaryâma.
1	2	3	He draws it from inside the strainer , whereby he puts that in-breathing into him as one tending towards him, and that in-breathing of his is placed (or beneficial) within his self. And thereby also that Upâmsu (libation) of his comes to be drawn from inside the strainer (i.e. from the pure Soma), for one and the same are the Upâmsu and Antaryâma, since they are the out-breathing and in-breathing. And thereby, moreover, that (vital air) of his comes to be unceasing also at the other grahas.
1	2	4	Now as to why he purifies the Soma by means of a strainer (pavitra). When Soma had oppressed his own family-priest Brihaspati, he restored to him (his property); and on his restoring it, he (Brihaspati) became reconciled to him. Still there was guilt remaining, if only for having contemplated oppressing the priesthood.
1	2	5	The gods purified him by some means of purification (or a strainer, pavitra), and, being cleansed and pure, he became the (sacrificial) food of the gods. Andin like manner does he now purify him by means of that strainer, and, being cleansed and pure, he becomes the food of the gods.
1	2	6	Then as to why the grahas are drawn with the Upayâma . Now Aditi is this (earth), and hers was that prâyanîya oblation, that Âditya rice-pap . But that was, as it were, previous to the Soma feast: she desired to have a share along with the gods in the Soma feast, and said, 'Let there be for me also a share of the pressed Soma!'
1	2	7	The gods said, 'This sacrifice has already been distributed among the deities: by means of thee the grahas shall be taken and offered to the deities!'-- 'So be it!' This, then, is her share of the pressed Soma.
1	2	8	And, again, why the grahas are drawn with the Upayâma. The Upayâma indeed is this (earth), since it is this (earth) that bears (upa-yam ) food here for cattle and men and trees; and the gods are above this, for the gods are in heaven.
1	2	9	The reason, then, why the grahas are drawn with the Upayâma, is that they are drawn by means of this (earth); and why he deposits them in the womb , is that this earth is the womb of everything, that it is from her that these creatures have sprung.
1	2	10	That same Soma the priests carry about as seed. And seed which is cast outside the womb is lost; but that which he deposits in the womb is indeed deposited in this earth.
1	2	11	Now these two grahas are his out-breathing and in-breathing; one of them he offers after sunrise and the other before sunrise, in order to keep the out-breathing and in-breathing distinct from each other. He thus keeps the out-breathing and in-breathing distinct from each other: hence these two, even while being one and the same, are yet called differently 'out-breathing' and 'in-breathing.'
1	2	12	Now those two grahas are for him day and night; one of them he offers after sunrise and theother before sunrise, in order to keep day and night distinct from each other: he thus keeps day and night distinct. from each other  .
1	2	13	The Upâmsu, being the day, he offers in the night; and thus he puts the day into the night: whence even in the deepest darkness one distinguishes something .
1	2	14	The Antaryâma, being the night, he offers after sunrise, and thus he puts the night into the day: whence that sun, on rising, does not burn up these creatures; whence these creatures are preserved.
1	2	15	He draws (the Antaryâma graha) therefrom  with , 'Thou art taken with a support!'--The significance of the Upayâma has been told .--'Restrain thou, O mighty (Indra), guard Soma!' the mighty, forsooth, is Indra; and Indra is the leader of the sacrifice: wherefore he says 'O mighty!' and by 'guard Soma' he means to say 'protect Soma!' 'Preserve the riches! gain thee food in the sacrifice!'--riches mean cattle: 'Protect the cattle' he thereby means to say. 'Gain thee food in the sacrifice!'--food means creatures: he thus makes these eager to sacrifice, and these creatures go on sacrificing and praising and toiling.
1	2	16	'Into thee I lay day and night ; into thee I lay the wide air: allied with the gods, the lower and the higher,'--thereby he makes this (graha) one belonging to all the gods: because by means of it these creatures move about in the air breathing out and breathing in, therefore it belongs to all the gods.--'Delight thyself in the Antaryâma, O mighty one!' the mighty one is Indra, and Indra is the leader of the sacrifice, wherefore he says 'O mighty one!' and in that he draws it with 'into--into,' thereby he means to say 'I lay thee into his (Indra's) self.'
1	2	17	Having drawn it, he wipes (the vessel) all round, lest (any Soma-juice) should trickle down. He does not deposit it; for this is the in-breathing: hence this in-breathing passes unceasingly. But should he desire to exorcise, let him deposit it with 'I put thee down, the in-breathing of N.N.!'
1	2	18	If he deposits the Upâmsu, let him also deposit this (Antaryâma cup) ; and if he does not deposit the Upâmsu, let him also not deposit this. And if he covers the Upâmsu (with his hand), let him also cover this; and if he does not cover the Upâmsu, let him also not cover this: as the performance regarding the Upâmsu, so regarding this (graha); for one and the same are these two, the Upâmsu and Antaryâma, since they are the out-breathing and in-breathing.
1	2	19	Now the Karakas, forsooth, offer these two (libations) with two different formulas , saying, 'These two are his out-breathing and in-breathing: we make the out-breathing and in-breathing of varied vigour.' But let him not do this, for they disorder the sacrificer's out-breathing and in-breathing. Now, one might also  offer this one silently:--
1	2	20	But, as he offers the Upâmsu with a formula, even thereby this (libation) also comes to be offered with a formula. How then could one offer it silently, for these two, the Upâmsu and Antaryâma, are one and the same, since they are the out-breathing and in-breathing?
1	2	21	With the very same formula with which he offers the Upâmsu, he offers this (libation),--'Self-made thou art: for all powers divine and earthly: may the mind obtain thee! Hail!--thee, O well-born, for Sûrya!' The significance of this formula has been told.
1	2	22	And, having offered , he wipes the cup clean downwards. For even now, after offering the Upâmsu, he wiped (the cup) upwards; but here he wipes it downwards; whereby he puts the in-breathing into him as one tending towards him.
1	2	23	He then rubs (the wiped-off Soma) upon the middle enclosing stick from east to west with the palm of his hand turned downwards. For even now, after offering the Upâmsu, he rubbed it upon themiddle enclosing stick from west to east with the palm of his hand turned upwards; but here he does so from east to west with the palm of his hand turned downwards--whereby he puts the in-breathing into him as one tending towards him--with, 'Thee for the gods sipping motes of light!' The significance is the same as before.
1	2	24	Having returned (to the cart-shed), he deposits that (cup) with, 'Thee for the in-breathing!' for this is indeed his in-breathing. He deposits them  so as to touch one another; whereby he makes out-breathing and in-breathing touch one another, joins the out-breathings and in-breathings together.
1	2	25	Now these (cups and stone) repose without being moved until the evening Soma feast, whence men sleep here on earth; and at the evening Soma feast they are used again, whence these men, having slept, awake and are bustling and restless;--this, forsooth, is after the manner of the sacrifice, for the sacrifice is fashioned like a bird: the Upâmsu and Antaryâma (grahas) are its wings, and the Upâmsusavana (stone) its body.
1	2	26	They repose without being moved until the evening Soma feast. The sacrifice is spread along; but what is spread along moves, whence those birds fly spreading their wings, not drawing them in. At the evening Soma feast they are again used; whencethese birds fly drawing in their wings to fold them: this indeed is after the manner of the sacrifice.
1	2	27	The Upâmsu, forsooth, is this (earth), for the Upâmsu is the out-breathing, and breathing out one breathes upon this (earth). And the Antaryâma is yonder (sky), for the Upâmsu is the in-breathing (up-breathing), and in breathing up one breathes towards yonder world. And the Upâmsu-savana (stone) is the air, for the Upâmsu-savana is the through-breathing, and he who breathes through (in and out), breathes through this air.
1	3	1	The Aindra-vâyava (graha), forsooth, is his speech; and as such belonging to his self . Now Indra, when he had hurled the thunderbolt at Vritra, thinking himself to be the weaker, and fearing lest he had not laid him low, hid himself. The gods also hid themselves away in the same place.
1	3	2	The gods then said, 'Verily, we know not if Vritra be slain or alive: come, let one of us find out, if Vritra be slain or alive!'
1	3	3	They said unto Vâyu--Vâyu, forsooth, is he that blows yonder--'Find thou out, O Vâyu, if Vritra be slain or alive; for thou art the swiftest among us: if he lives, thou indeed wilt quickly return hither.'
1	3	4	He spake, 'What shall be my reward then?'--'The first Vashat of king Soma!'--'So be it!' so Vâyu went, and lo  Vritra slain. He spake, 'Vritra is slain: do ye with the slain what ye list!'
1	3	5	The gods rushed thither,--as (those) eager to take possession of their property, so (it fared with) him (Vritra--Soma) : what (part of him) one of them seized, that became an ekadevatya (graha, belonging to one deity), and what two of them, that became a dvidevatya , and what many (seized), that became a bahudevatya;--and because they caught him up each separately (vi-grah) by means of vessels, therefore (the libations) are called graha.
1	3	6	He stank in their nostrils,--sour and putrid he blew towards them: he was neither fit for offering, nor was he fit for drinking.
1	3	7	The gods said to Vâyu, 'Vâyu, blow thou through him, make him palatable for us!' He said, 'What shall be my reward then?'--'After thee they shall name those cups.'--'So be it!' he said, 'but blow ye along with me!'
1	3	8	The gods dispelled some of that smell, and laid it into the cattle,--this is that foul smell in (dead) cattle: hence one must not close (his nose) at that foul smell, since it is the smell of king Soma.
1	3	9	Nor must one spit thereat ; even though he should think himself ever so much affected, let himgo round it windward ; for Soma means eminence, and disease meanness: even as at the approach of his superior the meaner man would get down (from his seat), so does disease go down before him (Soma).
1	3	10	Then Vâyu blew a second time through him and thereby made him palatable; whereupon he was fit for offering and fit for drinking. Hence those (vessels), though belonging to various deities, are called 'vâyavya (Vâyu's vessels) .' His (Vâyu's) is that first Vashat of king Soma, and, moreover, those vessels are named after him.
1	3	11	Indra then thought within himself:--'Vâyu, forsooth, has the largest share of this our sacrifice, since his is the first Vashat of king Soma, and, moreover, those vessels are named after him: nay, but I, too, will desire a share therein!'
1	3	12	He said, 'Vâyu, let me share in this cup!'--'What will then be?'--'Speech shall speak intelligibly !'--'If speech will speak intelligibly, then will I let thee share!' Thus that cup henceforward belonged to Indra and Vâyu, but theretofore it belonged to Vâyu alone.
1	3	13	Indra said, 'One half of this cup is mine!'--'Only one fourth is thine!' said Vâyu.--'One half is mine!' said Indra.--'Only one fourth is thine!' said Vâyu.
1	3	14	They went to Pragâpati for his decision. Pragâpati divided the cup (of Soma) into two parts and said, 'This (half) is Vâyu's!' Then he divided the (other) half into two parts and said, 'This is Vâyu's!--This is thine!' then he assigned to Indra a fourth part for his share--one fourth is the same as a quarter: henceforward that cup belonged, one fourth of it, to Indra.
1	3	15	Now with this libation there are two puroruk --formulas,--the first belonging to Vâyu alone, and the second to Indra and Vâyu; and two invitatory prayers (anuvâkyâ),--the, first to Vâyu alone, and the second to Indra and Vâyu; and two praisha (directions),--the first belonging to Vâyu alone, and the second to Indra and Vâyu; and two offering prayers (yâgyâ),--the first to Vâyu alone, and the second to Indra and Vâyu: thus he assigns to him (Indra) each time a fourth part for his share.
1	3	16	He said, 'If they have assigned to me a fourth part each time for my share, then speech shall speak intelligibly only one fourth part!' Hence only that fourth part of speech is intelligible which men speak; but that fourth part of speech which beasts speak is unintelligible; and that fourth part of speech which birds speak is unintelligible; and that fourth part of speech which the small vermin here speaks is unintelligible.
1	3	17	Wherefore it has been thus spoken by the Rishi :--'Four are the measured grades of speech; the Brâhmans that are wise know them: three, deposited in secret, move not; the fourth grade of speech men speak.'
1	3	18	He now draws (the graha) from that (stream of Soma) , with , 'Come nigh to us, O Vâyu, sipping ofthe pure (Soma)! Thine are a thousand steeds, O bestower of all boons! Unto thee hath been offered the gladdening juice whereof thou, O God, takest the first draught!--Thee for Vâyu!'
1	3	19	And, having withdrawn (the cup), he again fills it , with , 'O Indra and Vâyu, here is Soma-juice: come ye hither for the refreshing draught, the drops long for you!--Thou art taken with a support !--Thee for Vâyu, for Indra and Vâyu!'--with 'This is thy womb : thee for the closely united!' he deposits (the cup). As to why he says, 'Thee for the closely united,'--he who is Vâyu, is Indra; and he who is Indra, is Vâyu: therefore he says, 'This is thy womb: thee for the closely united!'
1	4	1	Mitra and Varuna, forsooth, are his intelligence and will; and as such belonging to his self: whenever he desires anything in his mind, as 'Would that this were mine! I might do this!' that is intelligence; and whenever that is accomplished, that is will . Now intelligence indeed is Mitra, and will is Varuna; and Mitra is the priesthood, and Varuna the nobility; and the priesthood is the conceiver, and the noble is the doer.
1	4	2	Now in the beginning these two, the priesthood and the nobility, were separate: then Mitra, the priesthood, could stand without Varuna, the nobility.
1	4	3	Not Varuna, the nobility, without Mitra, the priesthood: whatever deed Varuna did unsped by Mitra, the priesthood, therein, forsooth, he succeeded not.
1	4	4	Varuna, the nobility, then called upon Mitra, the priesthood, saying, 'Turn thou unto me that we may unite: I will place thee foremost, sped by thee, I will do deeds!'--'So be it!' So the two united; and therefrom resulted that graha to Mitra and Varuna.
1	4	5	Such, then, is the office of Purohita (placed foremost, domestic priest). Wherefore let not a Brâhman desire to become the Purohita of any one Kshatriya (he may meet with), as thereby righteousness and unrighteousness unite; nor should a Kshatriya make any Brâhman (he may meet with) his Purohita, as thereby righteousness and unrighteousness unite.--Whatever deed, sped by Mitra, the priesthood, Varuna thenceforward did, in that he succeeded.
1	4	6	Hence it is quite proper that a Brâhman should be without a king, but were he to obtain a king, it would be conducive to the success (of both). It is, however, quite improper that a king should be without a Brâhman, for whatever deed he does, unsped by Mitra, the priesthood, therein he succeeds not. Wherefore a Kshatriya who intends to do a deed ought by all means to resort to a Brâhman, forhe verily succeeds only in the deed sped by the Brâhman.
1	4	7	Now he draws (the Maitrâ-varuna graha) from that (stream of Soma) , with , 'This Soma, O Mitra and Varuna, hath been pressed for you; ye holy, now hear my cry!--Thou art taken with a support !--Thee for Mitra and Varuna!'
1	4	8	He mixes it with milk. The reason why he mixes it with milk is this. Soma, forsooth, was Vritra. Now when the gods slew him, they said to Mitra, 'Thou also slayest!' But he liked it not and said, 'Surely, I am every one's friend (mitra): being no friend, I shall become an enemy (or, other than Mitra, Amitra).'--'Then we shall exclude thee from the sacrifice!'--Then said he, 'I, too, slay!' Thereupon the cattle went from him, saying, 'Being a friend, he has become an enemy!' Thus he was deprived of the cattle. By mixing (the Soma) with milk, the gods then supplied him with cattle; and in like manner does this (priest) now supply him (the sacrificer or Mitra) with cattle by mixing (the Soma) with milk.
1	4	9	As to this they say, 'Surely he liked it not to slay!' Thus, what milk there is in this (mixture) that belongs to Mitra, but the Soma belongs to Varuna: therefore one mixes it with milk.
1	4	10	He mixes it with , 'May we delight in the wealth we have gained, the gods in the offering, the kine in pasture! that unfailing milch cow, O Mitra and Varuna, grant ye unto us day by day!'--with 'This is thy womb: thee for truth and life !' he deposits it. Now as to why he says, 'Thee for truth and life,'--the truth is Mitra , since Mitra is the Brahman, and the truth is the Brahman (sacerdotium or sacred writ);--and life is Varuna, since Varuna is the year, and life is the year: therefore he says, 'This is thy womb: thee for truth and life!'
1	5	1	The Âsvina graha , forsooth, is his organ of hearing; hence in drinking it he turns (the cup) all round , since with that ear of his he hears all round.--Now when the Bhrigus, or the Aṅgiras, attained the heavenly world, Kyavana the Bhârgava, or Kyavana the Âṅgirasa, was left behind here (on earth) decrepit and ghostlike .
1	5	2	But Saryâta, the Mânava, just then wandered about here with his tribe, and settled near by that same place. His boys , while playing, setting that decrepit, ghostlike man at nought, pelted him with clods.
1	5	3	He was wroth with the Sâryâtas, and sowed discord among them: father fought with son, and brother with brother.
1	5	4	Saryâta then bethought him ,--'This has come to pass for something or other I have done!' He caused the cowherds and shepherds to be called together, and said--
1	5	5	He said, 'Which of you has seen anything here this day?'--They said, 'Yonder lies a man, decrepit and ghostlike: him the boys have pelted with clods, setting him at nought.' Then Saryâta knew that this was Kyavana.
1	5	6	He yoked his chariot, and putting his daughter Sukanyâ thereon, he set forth, and came to the place where the Rishi was.
1	5	7	He said, 'Reverence be to thee, O Rishi;because I knew thee not, therefore have I offended thee; here is Sukanyâ , with her I make atonement to thee: let my tribe live at peace together!' And from that same time his tribe lived at peace together. But Saryâta, the Mânava, departed  forthwith, lest he should offend him a second time.
1	5	8	Now the Asvins then wandered about here on earth performing cures. They came to Sukanyâ, and desired to win her love; but she consented not thereto.
1	5	9	They said, 'Sukanyâ, what a decrepit, ghostlike man is that whom thou liest with; come and follow us!' She said, 'To whom my father has given me, him will I not abandon, as long as he lives!' But the Rishi was aware of this.
1	5	10	He said, 'Sukanyâ, what have those two said to thee?' She told him all; and, when she had told him, he said, 'If they speak to thee thus again, say thou to them, "But surely, ye are neither quite complete nor quite perfect, and yet ye deride my husband!" and if they say to thee, "In what respect are we incomplete, in what respect imperfect?" say thou to them, "Nay, make ye my husband young again, and I will tell you!"' They came again to her, and said to her the same thing.
1	5	11	She said, 'But surely ye are neither quite complete nor quite perfect, and yet ye deride my husband!' They said, 'In what respect are we incomplete, in what respect imperfect?' She said, 'Nay, make ye my husband young again, and I will tell you!'
1	5	12	They said, 'Take him down to yonder pool , and he shall come forth with whatever age he shall desire!' She took him down to that pool, and he came forth with the age he desired.
1	5	13	They said, Sukanyâ, in what respect are we incomplete, in what respect imperfect?' The Rishi himself answered them,--'In Kurukshetra yonder the gods perform a sacrifice and exclude you two from it: in that respect ye are incomplete, in that respect imperfect!' And the Asvins departed forthwith, and came to the gods, as they were performing a sacrifice, after the chanting of the Bahishpavamâna.
1	5	14	They said, 'Invite us thereto!' The gods said, 'We will not invite you: ye have wandered and mixed much among men, performing cures.'
1	5	15	They said, 'But surely ye worship with aheadless sacrifice!'--'How with a headless (sacrifice)?'--'Nay, invite us, and we will tell you!'--'So be it!' so they invited them. They drew this Âsvina cup for them; and those two became the Adhvaryu priests of the sacrifice, and restored the head of the sacrifice. Then, in the chapter of the divâkîrtyas , it is explained how they did restore the head of the sacrifice. Hence this libation is drawn after the chanting of the Bahishpavamâna, for it was after the chanting of the Bahishpavamâna that they arrived.
1	5	16	They said, 'Well, but we two, being the Adhvaryus, are the heads (leaders) of the sacrifice: transfer ye that graha of ours to this earlier time, to those belonging to two deities !' Accordingly they transferred that graha for them to a former time, to those belonging to two deities: hence that graha is drawn in the tenth place, and is consecrated by Vashat in the third place. And as to (the significance of) the Asvins,--the Asvins are manifestly  those two, heaven and earth , for it is those twothat have obtained possession of everything here;--'the lotus-crowned' they (the Asvins) are called: Agni, forsooth, is the lotus of this earth, and the sun that of yonder sky.
1	5	17	Thus he takes (the Âsvina graha) from that (stream of Soma) , with , 'Mix ye the sacrifice, O Asvins, with that goad of yours, rich in honey and joyfulness!--Thou art taken with a support ! thee for the Asvins!' with 'This is thy womb: thee for the honey-loving  (Asvins)!' he deposits it. Now as to why he takes (the graha) with a verse containing (the word) 'honey (madhu),' and deposits it with 'thee for the honey-loving!'
1	5	18	Dadhyañk, the Âtharvana, imparted to them (the Asvins) the brâhmana called Madhu : that (Madhu) is their favourite resort, and with that (favourite resort) of theirs he now approaches them;--hence he takes (their graha) with a verse containing (the word) 'honey,' and deposits it with 'thee for the honey-loving!'
1	5	19	Now those vessels (other than those of the three dvidevatya grahas) are smooth . The vessel of the graha for Indra and Vâyu has a (wooden) 'belt' round it: this is its second (peculiarity of) shape, and therefore it belongs to two deities. The vessel of the graha for Mitra and Varuna is goat-like : this is its second shape, and therefore it belongs to two deities. The vessel of the graha for the Asvins is lip-shaped: this is its second shape, and therefore it belongs to two deities. And the reason why (this belongs to) the Asvins is that the Asvins are the heads (mukhya, viz. of the sacrifice), and this head (mukha ) is supplied with lips: hence the vessel of the Asvina graha is lip-shaped.
2	1	1	The Sukra and Manthin (grahas), forsooth, are his eyes. Now the Sukra, indeed, is he that burns yonder (the sun); and because it burns there , therefore it is (called) Sukra ('bright'). And the Manthin, indeed, is the moon.
2	1	2	He mixes it with (barley) meal: thus he makes it to be gruel (mantha), whence it is (called) Manthin. Now those two (sun and moon); forsooth, are the eyes of these creatures; for were those two not to rise, these (creatures) could not distinguish even their own hands.
2	1	3	One of them is the eater, and the other thefood ; to wit, the Sukra is the eater, and the Manthin the food.
2	1	4	To one of them corresponds the eater, and to the other the food; to wit, the eater corresponds to the Sukra, and the food to the Manthin. Now these two (cups) are drawn for one (person) and offered to another. There are two Asura-Rakshas, Sanda and Marka: for them they are drawn; and to deities they are offered. The reason for this is as follows.
2	1	5	Now when the gods drove away the Asura-Rakshas, they could not drive away these two; but whatever (sacrificial) work the gods performed, that these two disturbed, and then quickly fled.
2	1	6	The gods then said, 'Contrive ye how we shall drive away these two!' They said, 'Let us draw two cups (of Soma juice) for them: they will come down to us, and we shall seize them and drive them away.' They accordingly drew two cups (of Soma) for them, and they both came down, and, having seized them, they (the gods) drove them away . This is why (the two cups) are drawn for Sanda and Marka, but are offered to deities.
2	1	7	Also Yâgñavalkya said, 'Should we not rather draw them for the deities, since that is, as it were, the sign of conquest ?' In this, however, he merely speculated, but he did not practise it.
2	1	8	Now some make this the puroruk formula of the Sukra, 'He, the longing, light-enveloped, urged the daughters of the dappled (cloud) along the measurer of the welkin,'--saying, 'We thus make it like him that burns yonder, in that he says "the light-enveloped."'
2	1	9	But let him make this one the puroruk formula of the Sukra , 'In the olden way, in the former way, in every way, in this way (drawest thou) supremacy from him, the barhis-seated, and the bliss-attaining,'--for the eater corresponds to this (Sukra cup), and the eater is supreme hence he says, 'Supremacy from him, the barhis-seated, bliss-attaining,'--and onward strength drawest thou from him, the roaring , the swift, that winneth those  through which thou waxest strong.--Thou art taken with a support: thee for Sanda!'--With 'This is thy womb: protect manhood!' he deposits (the cup); for to this one corresponds the eater, and the man (hero) is the eater: hence he says, 'This is thy womb: protect manhood!' He deposits it on the south part (of the mount), for it is in that direction that yonder (sun) moves.
2	1	10	Thereupon he draws the Manthin with , 'He, the longing , light-enveloped , urged the daughters of the dappled  on the measurer of the welkin : him the bards kiss like a child with songs at the union of the waters and the sun.--Thou art taken with a support: thee to Marka!'
2	1	11	He mixes it with (barley) meal: the reason why he mixes it with meal is this. Varuna once struck king Soma right in the eye, and it swelled (asvayat): therefrom a horse (asva) sprung; and because it sprung from a swelling, therefore it is called asva. A tear of his fell down: therefrom the barley sprung; whence they say that the barley belongs to Varuna. Thus whatever part of his eye was injured on that occasion in (that part he now restores him and makes him whole by means of this (barley): therefore he mixes (the libation) with meal.
2	1	12	He mixes it with , 'At whichever offerings ye two, rushing swiftly as thought, accept with favour the songs--he, the manly, who by the reeds of this (one) hath seasoned  in the hand the (object of his) desire;'--with 'This is thy womb: protect the creatures!' he deposits it (on the north part of the mound); for to this (graha) corresponds the food, and these creatures, the people, are food: hence he says, 'This is thy womb: protect the creatures!'
2	1	13	There are two sprinkled and two unsprinkled chips of the sacrificial stake : the Adhvaryu takes a sprinkled and an unsprinkled one; and in like manner the Pratiprasthâtri takes a sprinkled and an unsprinkled one. And the Adhvaryu takes the Sukra, the Pratiprasthâtri the Manthin.
2	1	14	The Adhvaryu cleanses (his cup) with the unsprinkled chip, with, Swept away is Sanda!' In like manner the Pratiprasthâtri with, 'Swept away is Marka!' Thus even while drawing (the cups), they drive away the two Asura-Rakshas. With 'May the Sukra-sipping gods lead thee forward!' the Adhvaryu walks out (of the cart-shed); with 'May the Manthin-sipping gods lead thee forward!' the Pratiprasthâtri: thus they lead forward those two (libations) to the deities.
2	1	15	Behind the Âhavanîya fire they put their (right) elbows together, and deposit (the cups) on the high altar: the Adhvaryu on the right hip, and the Pratiprasthâtri on the left--without quitting their hold of them--with 'Unassailable artthou!' whereby they make the high altar unassailable by evil spirits; for they are about, in walking round it, to pass by the fire: hereby, then, they propitiate it, and so the fire does not injure them, while they walk round it on different sides .
2	1	16	The Adhvaryu walks round it (on the north side) with , 'Abounding in heroes, producing heroes'--for to this (libation) corresponds the eater, and the hero is the eater: hence he says, 'Abounding in heroes, producing heroes!'--'encompass thou  the sacrificer with growth of wealth!' By saying 'Encompass thou the sacrificer with growth of wealth!' he invokes a blessing upon the sacrificer.
2	1	17	And the Pratiprasthâtri walks round (on the south side) with , 'Abounding in creatures, producing creatures'--for to this (libation) corresponds the food, and the creatures, the people, are the food: hence he says, 'Abounding in creatures, producing creatures,'--'encompass thou the sacrificer with growth of wealth!' By saying 'Encompass thou the sacrificer with growth of wealth!' he invokes a blessing on the sacrificer.
2	1	18	They step out (from the altar) after closing the two (cups with their hands): thereby they make them invisible; whence no one sees yonder sun and moon when they go forward (eastwards). Having gone round to the front (of the stake), they uncover (the cups), and offer them while standing in front: thereby they make them visible; whence every onesees yonder sun and moon when they go backwards. Hence also no one sees the seed which is cast forwards, but every one sees what is produced backwards.
2	1	19	They put their elbows together behind the sacrificial stake, unless the fire should blaze up ; but. if the fire blaze up, they may join their elbows in front of the stake,--the Adhvaryu with, 'The Sukra (bright), uniting with the sky, with the earth, with the brightly shining;' the Pratiprasthâtri with, 'The Manthin, uniting with the sky, with the earth, with the manthin-shining.' Thus they make these two (cups) the resting-places of the eyes, and join the two eyes together: whence these two eyes are joined together with bones all round .
2	1	20	The Adhvaryu throws the unsprinkled stake-chip outside (the altar) with, 'Cast out is Sanda!' and in like manner the Pratiprasthâtri with, 'Cast out is Marka!' Thus they drive away the two Asura-Rakshas before the offerings.
2	1	21	Thereupon the Adhvaryu throws the sprinkled stake-chip on the Âhavanîya with, 'Thou art the abode of the Sukra!' and in like manner the Pratiprasthâtri with, 'Thou art the abode of the Manthin!' These two (chips), forsooth, are the kindlers of the eyes,--he kindles the eyes therewith; whence these eyes are kindled.
2	1	22	Thereon he mutters , 'Maywe be the preservers of thine unbroken manhood and prosperity, O divine Soma!' This is the benediction of that performance: he thereby invokes a blessing.
2	1	23	He then calls (on the Agnîdh) for the Sraushat, and says, 'Urge thou for Indra the Soma-draughts brought forward, the pure, sweet-flowing, of the morrow's morning feast!' As the Vashat is uttered, the Adhvaryu offers; then the Pratiprasthâtri; then the cup-bearers (kamasâdhvaryu).
2	1	24	Those two offer while standing in front (of the fire); for these two (libations) are the eyes: thus they put those eyes in the front; and hence these eyes are in the front.
2	1	25	They offer while standing on both sides of the stake; for what the nose is, that is the sacrificial stake: hence these two eyes are on both sides of the nose.
2	1	26	Being consecrated by Vashat, these two (libations) are offered with a prayer. Now it is because the entire Savana is offered after these two (libations) that they attain to this (distinction) ; and the reason why the entire Savana is offered after them, is that they are most distinctly Pragâpati's own: for they are the eyes, and the eye is the truth, and Pragâpati is the truth;--this is why the entire Savana is offered after them.
2	1	27	He offers with,' This is the first consecration, assuring all boons: he is the first, Varuna, Mitra, Agni;--he is the first, Brihaspati, the wise: to that Indra offer ye the liquor, Hail !'
2	1	28	Now when he offers with, 'This is the first--he is the first,' it is just as with cast seed; for the eyes doubtless are formed first  hence he offers with, 'This is the first--he is the first'
2	1	29	He then gives directions:--'Let the Hotri's cup advance! let the Brahman's, the Chanters’, the Sacrificer's (cups) advance! Ye cup-bearers of the fire-priests , approach and fill up (the cups) with pure Soma!'--this is a composite direction. Having gone round (to behind the high altar) the Pratiprasthâtri pours his residue (of Soma) into the Adhvaryu's (Sukra) vessel; whereby he makes the food pay tribute to the eater. The Adhvaryu pours it into the Hotri's cup for drinking; because the draught belongs to the utterer of the Vashat; for the Vashat is the breath, and that breath has, as it were, departed from him while uttering the Vashat. Now the draught is breath: thus he puts that breath back into him.
2	1	30	And the reason why they do not take thosetwo (cups) behind , but do so take the other cups, is that those two are the eyes. The residue (of Soma), then, he pours into the Hotri's cup.
2	1	31	They now fill up the cups of the fire-priests. For those residues  are remains of oblations, insufficient for offering: he now fills them up again, and thus they become sufficient for offering: therefore they fill up the cups of the fire-priests.
2	1	32	Thereupon they make the fire-priests offer together . Now the fire-priests combined conveythe sacrifice to the gods,--it is them he thereby satisfies together, thinking, 'Satisfied and pleased they shall convey the sacrifice to the gods;' therefore they make the fire-priests offer together.
2	1	33	When (the libation of) the first, or last  fire-priest has been offered, he addresses them , 'Let the priests’ offices be satisfied, they that have obtained a good sacrifice of sweet drink; they that are well-pleased, when they have obtained good offering with Svâhâ!' for this is the satisfaction of the priests’ (offices). Thereupon he approaches (to the Hotri's hearth) and sits down with his face to the west, with 'The Agnîdh hath sacrificed!' for on this occasion the Agnîdh sacrifices last of those that sacrifice: hence he says, 'The Agnîdh hath sacrificed.'
2	2	1	The Âgrayana graha, forsooth, is his self (body, trunk), and as such it is his all; for this self is one's all. Therefore he draws it by means of this (earth), for of her is the bowl , and with a bowl he draws this (libation); and this (earth) is all, as thisgraha is all: hence he takes it by means of this (earth).
2	2	2	He draws it full; for the 'full' means all, and this graha is all: therefore he draws it full.
2	2	3	: He draws it for the All-gods; for the All-gods are all, and this graha is all: therefore he draws it for the All-gods.
2	2	4	He draws it at all (three) Soma feasts; for the (three) feasts mean all, and this graha is all: therefore he draws it at all the feasts.
2	2	5	And if the king (Soma) become exhausted, they extend him from out of that (bowl), make him issue therefrom; for the Âgrayana is the body, and from the body all these limbs issue. Therefrom they draw at the end the Hâriyogana cup : whereby the sacrifice is established at the end in this resting-place, the body (or its own self).
2	2	6	Then as to why it is called Âgrayana. His speech which he restrains, on taking up that press-stone , spoke out again first at this (libation); and because it spoke out first (agre) at this (libation), therefore this is called the Âgrayana .
2	2	7	It was from fear of the evil spirits that (the gods) restrained their speech. Previously to this he draws six grahas, and this is the seventh: for there are six seasons in the year, and the year is all.
2	2	8	And all being conquered and free from danger and injury , the gods now first uttered speech; andin like manner does he first utter speech now that everything is conquered and free from danger and injury.
2	2	9	He now draws it from that (stream of Soma ) with , Ye Gods, who are eleven in heaven, who are eleven on earth, and who are eleven dwelling in glory in the (aerial) waters: do ye graciously accept this sacrifice!--Thou art taken with a support: thou art Âgrayana, a good firstling (sv-âgrayana)!' Hereby he makes that speech of renewed vigour; whence he speaks therewith in a different way, while yet the same, in order to avoid sameness; for were he to take it with, 'Thou art Âgrayana, thou art Âgrayana,' he would commit (the fault of) sameness: therefore he says, 'Thou art Âgrayana, a good âgrayana.'
2	2	10	'Guard the sacrifice! guard the lord of the sacrifice!' whereby he utters freed speech, meaning to say, 'Protect the sacrifice! protect the sacrificer!' for the lord of the sacrifice is the sacrificer. 'May Vishnu-guard thee with his might! guard thou Vishnu!' whereby he utters freed speech--Vishnu being the sacrifice--'May the sacrificeprotect thee with its power! protect thou the sacrifice!'--'Guard thou the Soma feasts all around!' whereby he means this very graha, because that belongs to all (three) Soma feasts .
2	2	11	Having then wrapped up (the bowl in) a fringed filtering-cloth, he utters 'Hiṅ!' Now that same speech (Vâk, fem.), being unsupported, lay exhausted. By means of the 'Hiṅ' the gods infused breath into that exhausted speech, for the 'Hiṅ' is breath, the 'Hiṅ' is indeed breath: hence one cannot utter the sound 'hiṅ' after closing his nostrils. By means of that breath she rose again, for when one who is exhausted takes breath, he rises again. And in like manner does he now infuse breath into the exhausted speech by means of the 'Hiṅ,' and through. that breath she rises again. Thrice he utters the 'Hiṅ,' for threefold is the sacrifice.
2	2	12	He then says , 'Soma becometh pure!' For that (speech) which, for fear of the Asura-Rakshas, they (the gods) did not utter, he now utters and reveals when all is conquered and free from danger and injury: therefore he says, 'Soma becometh pure.'
2	2	13	'For this priesthood, for this nobility'--whereby he means to say, 'for the priesthood as well as for the nobility for the Soma-pressing sacrificer he becometh pure;' whereby he means to say, 'for the sacrificer.'
2	2	14	Here now they say, 'Having said this much, let him deposit (the cup); for as much as the priesthood, and the nobility, and the people are, so muchmeans this All, since Indra and Agni are this All : hence, having said this much, let him deposit (the cup).'
2	2	15	Let him, nevertheless, say this more, 'For sap and pith he becometh pure,'--by saying 'for sap' he means to say 'for rain;' and 'for pith' he says with a view to that pith or juice which springs from rain;--'for the waters and plants he becometh pure,' this he says for the waters and plants;--'for heaven and earth he becometh pure,' this he says for those two, heaven and earth, whereon this All rests;--'for well-being he becometh pure,' whereby he means to say 'for good.'
2	2	16	Here now some say, 'for spiritual lustre he becometh pure;' but let him not say so, for in saying 'for this priesthood,' he says it with a view to spiritual lustre. With, 'Thee for the All-gods! this is thy womb: thee for the All-gods!' he deposits (the cup); for it is for the All-gods that he draws it. He deposits it in the middle (of the mound); for this is his trunk, and that trunk is, as it were, in the middle. On the right (south) side of it is the Ukthya bowl, and on the left side the Âditya bowl.
2	3	1	That Ukthya (graha), forsooth, is his undefined breath (vital air) , and as such it is that self of his; for the undefined breath is the self; it is hisvital energy. Hence he draws it by means of this (earth), because of her is the bowl, and he draws it with a bowl;--for undecaying and immortal is this (earth), and undecaying and immortal is the vital energy; therefore he draws it by means of this (earth or bowl).
2	3	2	He draws it full; for full means all, and the vital energy means all: therefore he draws it full.
2	3	3	That Dhruva (graha) , forsooth, (also) is his vital energy; by it his body is held together, and the joints are knit together. For (when) the last cup has not yet been drawn from that (Soma juice in the Ukthya vessel) for the Akhâvâka priest,
2	3	4	Then he takes the king (Soma) down (from the cart) , and pours one third of the Vasatîvarîs (into the Âdhavanîya trough). Thus the joint unites; for, indeed, he makes (the Ukthya cup) the first of the second pressing (Soma feast), and the last of the first: that which belongs to the second pressing he makes first, and that which belongs to the first he makes last. Thus he interlocks them; whence these joints are interlocked: this one overlapping thus, and this one thus.
2	3	5	In like manner at the midday pressing: (when)the last cup has not yet been drawn therefrom for the Akhâvâka priest, he pours (the remaining) one-third of the Vasatîvarî (into the Âdhavanîya). Thus the joint unites; for, indeed, he makes it the first of the second pressing, and the last of the first pressing : that which belongs to the second pressing he makes first, and that which belongs to the first he makes last. Thus he interlocks them; whence these joints are interlocked: this one overlapping thus, and this one thus. And because his body is thereby held together, therefore this (graha) is his vital energy.
2	3	6	This (Ukthya graha) is the cow of plenty, Indra's special portion. At the morning feast he (the Adhvaryu) divides it for three songs of praise , and at the midday feast for three,--this makes six times, for there are six seasons, and the seasons mature all wishes here on earth: for this reason, then, this (libation) is the cow of plenty, Indra's special portion.
2	3	7	He draws it without (reciting) a puroruk; for the puroruk is a song of praise, since the puroruk is a Rik, and the song of praise is Rik; and the libation is Sâman; and what other (formula) he mutters, that is Yagus. Formerly these same (puroruk verses) were apart  from the Riks, apart from the Yagus, and apart from the Sâmans.
2	3	8	The gods said, 'Come, let us place them among the Yagus: thus this science will be still more manifold.' Accordingly they placed them among the Yagus, and thenceforward this science was still more manifold.
2	3	9	And the reason why he draws this (graha) without a puroruk, is that the puroruk is praise, (being) a Rik, and the song of praise is Rik; and in that he divides it for recitations, thereby indeed it becomes possessed of a puroruk: hence he draws it without a puroruk.
2	3	10	Now he draws it from that (stream of Soma ), with , 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for Indra, possessed of the great (chant), possessed of vigour,'--for Indra is the deity of the sacrifice; wherefore he says 'thee for Indra;' and by 'possessed of the great (chant), possessed of vigour,' he means to say 'for him, the strong;'--'I take (thee) the song-pleasing,' for he indeed takes it for songs of praise;--'what great vigour is thine, O Indra'--whereby he means to say, 'what strength is thine, O Indra'--'for that (I take) thee! for Vishnu--thee!' for he takes it for the life of the sacrifice: hence he says, 'for that--thee! for Vishnu--thee!' With, 'This is thy womb: thee for the songs of praise!' he deposits it; for he indeed takes it for songs of praise.
2	3	11	He distributes it  with, 'Thee, thegod-pleasing , I take for the gods, for the life of the sacrifice.' He who would perform it in this manner would assume the command ; but let him rather distribute it to the respective deities.
2	3	12	With, 'Thee, the god-pleasing, I take for Mitra and Varuna, for the life of the sacrifice!' (he takes the portion) for the Maitrâvaruna priest;--for in verses to Mitra and Varuna they (the Udgâtris) chant praises for this (libation); and he (the Hotri) afterwards recites verses to Mitra and Varuna for the sastra, and offers with a verse to Mitra and Varuna.
2	3	13	With, 'Thee, the god-pleasing, I take for Indra, for the life of the sacrifice!' (he takes the portion) for the Brâhmanâkhamsin; for in verses to Indra praises are chanted for this (libation); and verses to Indra are afterwards recited as a sastra, and offering is made with a verse to Indra.
2	3	14	With, 'Thee, the god-pleasing, I take for Indra and Agni, for the life of the sacrifice!' (he takes the portion) for the Akhâvâka; for in verses to Indra and Agni praises are chanted for this (libation); and verses to Indra and Agni are afterwards recited as a sastra, and offering is madewith a verse to Indra and Agni. With, 'Thee . . . . for Indra,' he performs at the midday feast, for the midday feast is sacred to Indra.
2	3	15	Now the Karakâdhvaryus  divide (the Ukthya libation into three portions), with 'Thou art taken with a support: thee, the god-pleasing, I take for the gods; (thee) the praise-pleasing, for praises, agreeable to Mitra and Varuna!'--with 'This is thy womb: thee to Mitra and Varuna!' he (the Karakâdhvaryu) deposits it; and with 'Thou art a re-offering' he touches the sthâlî.
2	3	16	'Thou art taken with a support: thee, the god-pleasing. I take for the gods; (thee) the praise-pleasing, for praises,--agreeable to Indra!--This is thy womb: thee to Indra!' thus he deposits it; and with 'Thou art a re-offering' he touches the sthâlî.
2	3	17	'Thou art taken with a support: thee, the god-pleasing, I take for the gods; (thee) the praise-pleasing, for praises,--agreeable to Indra and Agni!--This is thy womb: thee for Indra and Agni!' thus he deposits it. He does not at this (third portion) touch the sthâlî with 'Thou art a re-offering.' '. . . . Thee for Indra!' he says each time at the midday feast, for the midday feast is sacred to Indra.Twice he touches the sthâlî with 'Thou art a re-offering;' and silently he puts it down the third time.
2	3	18	But, in order to avoid sameness (of performance), let him not take it out with the 'support;' nor let him deposit it in the 'womb;' for this (Ukthyalibation) has at first been taken with the 'support,' and it has at first been deposited in the womb;--and were he now also to take it with the 'support,' and deposit it in the 'womb,' he would assuredly commit (the fault of) sameness. And as to his touching the sthâlî with 'Thou art a re-offering,' he will indeed again take a libation therefrom. Let him not heed this, but let him put down (the vessel) silently.
2	4	1	That (opening of) vital air of his which is in front, that, forsooth, is the Vaisvânara (graha); and that which is behind is the Dhruva. Formerly, indeed, both these grahas, the Dhruva and Vaisvânara, were drawn; and even now one of them is still drawn, to wit, the Dhruva . And if he acquire a knowledge of that (Vaisvânara graha) either from the Karakas, or from anywhere else, let him pour it into the sacrificer's cup; but this (Dhruva graha he pours) into the Hotri's cup .
2	4	2	Now, what part of him there is below the navel, that part of his self, that vital energy of his, is this (Dhruva): hence he draws it by means of this (earth), because of her is the bowl (sthâlî) , and with a bowl he draws it;--for undecaying and immortal is this (earth), and undecaying and immortal is the vital energy: therefore he draws it by means of this (earth).
2	4	3	He draws it full; for full means all, and the vital energy means all: therefore he draws it full.
2	4	4	He draws it for (Agni) Vaisvânara; for Vaisvânara ('he that belongs to all men') is the year, and the vital energy (life) is the year: therefore he draws it for Vaisvânara.
2	4	5	Having been drawn at the morning pressing, it reposes apart from that time: thus he guides him (the sacrificer) safely through all the pressings.
2	4	6	Let him not pour it (into the Hotri's cup) during the chanting; for, verily, were he to pour it out during the chanting, the sacrificer would not live through the year.
2	4	7	He pours it out during the recitation of the sastra; whereby he guides him safely over the twelvefold chant of praise: thus he obtains ever continued life, and thus does the sacrificer live long. Therefore the Brâhman should sit through the praise of Agni (Agnishtoma) ; till the offering of this (libation) he must not slip away --nor must hedischarge urine: thus he obtains the full life--for this (libation) is his life--thus he reaches the full (measure of) life.
2	4	8	For, what part of him there is below the navel, that part of his self is this (Dhruva libation). Hence were he to slip away or discharge urine before the offering of this (libation), he would discharge the Dhruva (the firm, constant one): hence, lest he should discharge the Dhruva, he sits through the praise of Agni. This, indeed, applies only to the sacrificer , for this (libation) is part of the sacrificer's self.
2	4	9	He sits through the praise of Agni ;--for Soma is glory: hence they both approach, he who partakes of the Soma and he who does not,--they approach, forsooth, to behold that glory. And thus indeed the Brahmans, having crept near together, take unto them that glory, when they drink (the Soma);--and verily whosoever, knowing this, drinks (Soma), becomes glorious  indeed.
2	4	10	Now, those same (priests) having, while gliding along , deposited that glory in him who sits through (celebrates) the praise of Agni, they glide along and turn away from that glory : having thus encompassed it, he again takes that glory unto himself;--verily, whosoever, knowing this, sits through (celebrates) the praise of Agni, he passes away after becoming the most glorious of these (men).
2	4	11	Now, the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pragâpati, were contending for this sacrifice--their father Pragâpati, the year,--saying, 'Ours he shall be! ours he shall be!'
2	4	12	Then the gods went on singing praises and toiling. They devised this Agnishtoma feast, and by means of this Agnishtoma feast they appropriated the entire sacrifice and excluded the Asuras from the sacrifice. And in like manner does this (sacrificer), by means of this Agnishtoma feast, now appropriate the entire sacrifice, and exclude his enemies from the sacrifice: therefore he celebrates the Agnishtoma.
2	4	13	Having drawn it (the Dhruva graha), he deposits it with the northern cart , lest he should confound the vital airs, for the grahas are vital airs: now the other grahas he deposits on the raised (mound), but this one (he deposits) after pushing (the dust) aside without leaving as much as a blade of grass between .
2	4	14	For those (other cups of Soma) are that part of his body from the navel upwards, and above, as it were, is what is from the navel upwards, and above, as it were, is what is raised: therefore he deposits (the others) on the raised (mound), and this one (he deposits) after pushing (the dust) aside without leaving as much as a blade of grass between.
2	4	15	For this (cup of Soma) is that part of his body from the navel downwards; and below, as it were, is what is from the navel downwards; and below, as it were, is what (one deposits) after pushing (the dust) aside and leaving not so much as a blade of grass between: therefore he deposits this (Dhruva graha) after pushing (the dust) aside, without leaving so much as a blade of grass between.
2	4	16	Now, that sacrifice which is being performed is Pragâpati, from whom these creatures on earth have been born,--and indeed even now they are born after this (sacrifice). The creatures that are born therefrom after those (libations) which he deposits on the raised (mound), stand on this (earth) with something different from their own self,--for those which stand on hoofs indeed stand on this (earth) with something different from their own self. And when he deposits this (Dhruva cup) after shifting aside (the dust), and not leaving so much as a blade of grass between,--the creatures that are born thereafter from this (sacrifice), stand on this (earth) with their own self, namely, men and wild beasts
2	4	17	Moreover, on the one hand, in throwing up (the mound) he puts upon this (earth) something different from it; and those creatures that are born from this (sacrifice) after those (libations) which he deposits on the raised (mound), they stand on this (earth) with something different from their own self, namely, with hoofs.
2	4	18	And, on the other hand, they offer in the Âhavanîya  a sacrificial cake, parched barley-grains, porridge, sour curds, and clotted curds,--this is like pouring (food) into one's mouth. But this (libation) remains apart, (being) of one form like water. Hence while he eats the multiform food with that mouth (the fire), he lets flow from that opening the uniform (libation) like water. Then as to why it is called Dhruva.
2	4	19	Now, once on a time, the gods, while performing sacrifice, were afraid of an attack from the Asura-Rakshas. The Asura-Rakshas assailed them from the south, and overturned those southern cups of Soma,--even that southern Soma-cart they overturned; but that other (cart) they could not overturn: the northern cart then kept the southern cart steady . And because they could not overturn that (northern cup) therefore it is called Dhruva (firm) .
2	4	20	They indeed watch over it; for this (cup of Soma) is the head of Gâyatrî, Gâyatrî being the sacrifice,--there are twelve chants (stotra) and twelve recitations (sastra): that makes twenty-four, and of twenty-four syllables consists the Gâyatrî. This cup of Soma is her head; but the head means excellence, for the head indeed means excellence: hence people say of him who is the best man of a place, that 'so and so is the head of such and such a place.' And, indeed, the best man would come to harm, if this (cup) were to come to harm; and, the best man being the sacrificer, they watch (this cup) lest the sacrificer should come to harm.
2	4	21	Moreover, this (graha) is Gâyatrî's calf, Gâyatrî being the sacrifice,--there are twelve chants and twelve recitations: that makes twenty-four, and of twenty-four syllables consists the Gâyatrî. This is her calf;--when they watch it, then they watch these calves for the sake of the milking: 'as they yield this milk, even so may this Gâyatrî yield all the sacrificer's wishes,'--this is why they watch it.
2	4	22	And when both the Adhvaryu and the Pratiprasthâtri walk out (of the cart-shed) and (afterwards) enter (again) , it is as if (a cow) were to come with the calf tied to her. They come to this cup of Soma, and he (the Adhvaryu) pours it out; whereby he lets loose the Gâyatrî: 'Made over to the sacrificer, may this Gâyatrî yield all his desires!' for this reason he pours it out.
2	4	23	He pours it (into the Hotri's cup ) with , 'The firm Soma I pour out--or, I take--with firm mind and speech: now may Indra make our people of one mind, free from enemies!' whereby he means to say, 'so that Indra may make these our creatures, the people, of one mind and free from enemies, for their happiness and glory and nourishment!'
2	4	24	Here now he draws it from that (stream of Soma) , , 'Agni Vaisvânara, the crest of heaven, the disposer of the earth, born in the sacred rite, the wise all-ruler, the guest of men,--him the gods have begotten as a vessel for their mouth. Thou art taken with a support: thou art firm (Dhruva), of firm abode, the firmest of the firm, the most solidly founded of the solid! This is thy womb--thee for Vaisvânara!' therewith he deposits it after pushing (the dust) aside, and not leaving so much as a blade of grass between: for he indeed takes it for (Agni) Vaisvânara.
2	5	1	Having drawn the cups of Soma, and gone out (of the cart-shed to the high altar) , he offers the oblation of drops . The reason why he offers the oblation of drops is this. Whatever drops of that (Soma) are spilt here, to them he now wishes a safe journey to the Âhavanîya, for the Âhavanîya is the resting-place of offerings: this is why he offers the oblation of drops.
2	5	2	He offers with , 'Whatever drop of thine leapethaway, whatever stalk of thine,'--whatever particle (of Soma) is spilt, that is a drop, that indeed he means; and by 'whatever stalk of thine' he mentions the stalk;--'stone-pressed, from the lap of the press-bowls;' for pressed by the stone  it leaps away from the two press-bowls;--'be it from the Adhvaryu or from the strainer,'--for it leaps away either from the Adhvaryu's hands or from the strainer,--'that I offer unto thee in my mind consecrated by Vashat, Hail!' whereby it becomes for him as an offering consecrated by Vashat.
2	5	3	Thereupon the Adhvaryu takes two stalks of grass from the covered altar. The two Adhvaryus  proceed first (to the chanting-place beside the pit), as the out-breathing and in-breathing of the sacrifice; then the Prastotri, as the voice of the sacrifice; then the Udgâtri, as the self (or body), the Pragâpati, of the sacrifice; then the Pratihartri, either as the physician or the through-breathing .
2	5	4	The Sacrificer holds on to those five priests from behind , for as much as those five priests are, so much is the whole sacrifice, the sacrifice being fivefold: hence the Sacrificer thereby holds on to the sacrifice.
2	5	5	He (the Adhvaryu) then throws one of the twostalks of grass forward towards the pit , with, 'Thou art the ascent of the gods!' for when the gods through the sacrifice attained to the heavenly world, it was from that pit that they went upwards to the heavenly world: he thus makes the sacrificer look along the road to heaven.
2	5	6	He then throws down the other stalk in front of the chanters, silently, for those chanters represent the hymn of praise (stotra), Pragâpati (the sacrifice),--he (Pragâpati) draws to himself everything here, and takes possession of everything here: it is to him that that stalk is offered, and thus he does not draw the Adhvaryu to himself, and take possession of him. And when they mutter ,--for the chanters mutter now ,--
2	5	7	Then he bespeaks the chant, saying, 'Soma becometh pure!' He bespeaks the chant right off , and they chant right off; for these chants, the Pavamânâh , are directed towards the gods, sincethe gods thereby attained to the heavenly world right off (straightway): therefore he bespeaks the chant right off, and right off they chant.
2	5	8	With 'Turn ye back !' (he bespeaks) the other chants (viz. the Dhuryas), and turning back (or repeating) they chant the Dhuryas , for the latterare directed towards these creatures: whence creatures are produced here repeatedly.
2	5	9	And as to why they chant the Bahishpavamâna here (near the kâtvâla). In the beginning, forsooth, yonder sun was here on earth . The seasons embraced him and ascended from hence to the heavenly world: there he burns firmly establishedin the seasons. And in like manner do the priests thereby embrace the sacrificer and ascend from hence to the heavenly world: this is why they chant the Bahishpavamâna h ere.
2	5	10	The Bahishpavamâna  chant truly is a shipbound heavenwards: the priests are its spars and oars, the means of reaching the heavenly world. If there be a blameworthy one, even that one (priest) would make it sink: he makes it sink, even as one who ascends a ship that is full would make it sink. And, indeed, every sacrifice is a ship bound heavenwards: hence one should seek to keep a blameworthy (priest) away from every sacrifice.
2	5	11	Thereupon, when the chanting is over , heutters this speech,--'Agnîdh, spread the fires! strew the barhis! Prepare the cakes! go on with the victim!' The Agnîdh spreads the fires, that is to say, kindles them ; he strews that barhis , thinking, 'When the barhis is strewn, I will offer to the gods on the kindled (fire).'--'Prepare the cakes,' he says, because he is about to proceed with the cakes; and, 'Go on with the victim,' because he is about to get ready the victim .
2	5	12	Having again entered (the cart-shed) he draws the Âsvina graha . Having drawn the Âsvina graha he goes out and girds the sacrificial stake ; and having girt the stake he gets ready the victim: he thereby puts flavour (juice) into him (Soma--the sacrificer).
2	5	13	Having been slain at the morning feast, it continues being cooked till the evening feast; whereby he puts flavour (juice) into the whole sacrifice, imbues it with flavour.
2	5	14	Let him therefore, at the Agnishtoma, slay a (victim) sacred to Agni, for there is harmony when, at the Agnishtoma, he slays a (victim) for Agni. Ifit be an Ukthya sacrifice, let him slay one to Indra and Agni in the second place, for songs of praise (uktha)  refer to Indra and Agni. If it be a Shodasin sacrifice, let him slay one to Indra in the third place, for the sixteenfold chant (shodasin)  means Indra. If it be an Atirâtra, let him slay one to Sarasvatî in the fourth place, for Sarasvatî is speech, and speech (vâk, fem.) is female, as the night (râtri, fem.) is female: he thus duly distinguishes the forms of sacrifice .
2	5	15	Thereupon he proceeds with (the offering of) the cakes of the Soma feast. Now Soma is a god, for Soma was in the heaven;--'Soma, forsooth, was Vritra; the mountains and stones are his body: thereon grows that plant called Usânâ,' said Svetaketu Auddâlaki; that they bring hither and press.'
2	5	16	Now when he slays the victim, he thereby puts flavour into it; and when he proceeds with (the offering of) the Soma feast cakes, he puts sap into it: thus it becomes Soma for him.
2	5	17	They all belong to Indra; for Indra is the deity of the sacrifice: that is why they all belong to Indra.
2	5	18	And as to why there are a cake, parched barley-grain, a porridge, sour curds, and clotted curds,--it is that those who are the deities of the sacrifice shall be well-pleased.
2	5	19	For, when one has eaten cake here, he wishes, 'I should like to take parched grains, I should like to eat porridge, I should like to eat sour curds, I should like to eat clotted curds!' All these (are Objects of one's) wishes: it is in order that those who are the deities of the sacrifice shall be well-pleased. Now as to why that offering of clotted curds (payasyâ) is prepared only at the morning libation, and not at the two other libations (Soma feasts).
2	5	20	The Gâyatrî, forsooth, bears the morning libation (to the gods), the Trishtubh the midday libation, and the Gagatî the evening libation,--but, then, the Trishtubh bears the midday libation, not alone, (but) with both the Gâyatrî and the Brihatî ; and the Gagatî (bears) the evening libation, not alone, (but) with the Gâyatrî, the Kakubh, and Ushnih, and the Anushtubh .
2	5	21	The Gâyatrî alone bears singly the morning libation,--with those two sets of five (paṅkti) , the set of five chants, and the set of five oblations: there are four Âgya (chants)  and the Bahishpavamâna is the fifth,--the Paṅkti metre is five-footed with that paṅkti of chants, not alone, the Gâyatrî bears the morning libation.
2	5	22	To Indra belongs the cake, to the two bay steeds the parched grains (dhânâh) , to Pûshan the porridge (karambha), to Sarasvatî the sour curds (dadhi), and to Mitra and Varuna the clotted curds (payasyâ) ,--the Paṅkti is five-footed--with that paṅkti of oblations, not alone, the Gâyatrî bears themorning libation (to the gods): for the sake of completing that paṅkti, that oblation of clotted curds to Mitra and Varuna is prepared only at the morning libation, and not at the two other libations.
3	1	1	Having drunk (Soma)  and said, 'We areinvited together ,' he (the Adhvaryu) rises. He takes a piece of the cake, and at the place where the Akhâvâka, being seated, is now (about to) recite, he puts the piece of cake in his hand and says, 'O Akhâvâka, say what thou hast to say!' Now, the Akhâvâka was excluded (from the Soma) .
3	1	2	Indra and Agni preserved him for the production of creatures, whence the Akhâvâka priest belongs to Indra and Agni. But it is by means of that sacrificial food, the piece of cake which he now puts in his hand, and by means of that (saying) of the seers which he now recites, it is thereby they (Indra and Agni) preserve him.
3	1	3	When the Akhâvâka has (again) taken his seat (behind his hearth), he (his Adhvaryu) proceeds with the libations of the seasons (Ritugraha). The reason why he proceeds with the libations of the seasons when the Akhâvâka is seated, is that the Akhâvâka represents a sexual union, since the Akhâvâka belongs to Indra and Agni, and Indra and Agni are two, and a productive union means a pair: from that same productive union he produces the seasons, the year.
3	1	4	And again why he proceeds with the libations of the seasons, when the Akhâvâka is seated. The seasons, the year, are everything; he thus produces everything: this is why he proceeds with the libations of the seasons when the Akhâvâka is seated.
3	1	5	Let him draw twelve of them,--twelve months there are. in the year: therefore he should draw twelve (cups of Soma). But he may also draw thirteen, for, they say, there is a thirteenth month . Let him nevertheless draw twelve only, for such is completeness.
3	1	6	He draws them from the Dronakalasa (Soma trough), for the Dronakalasa is Pragâpati, and from out of that Pragâpati he produces the seasons, the year.
3	1	7	He draws them by means of double-mouthed cups ;--for where is the end of those two (cups) that are double-mouthed? Hence this year revolves without end. When he has drawn this (libation), he does not deposit it: whence this year is ceaseless.
3	1	8	He recites no invitatory prayer; since oneinvites with an invitatory prayer, and the present season has already come, either by day or by night. Nor does he utter a second Vashat, lest he should turn away the seasons. Simultaneously they (the Adhvaryu and Pratiprasthâtri) draw the two first and the two last libations: thus they embrace everything here by means of the year, and everything here is embraced within the year.
3	1	9	Out (of the Havirdhâna shed) walks the one, in steps the other, whence these months pass following one another. But were both to walk out together, or were both to enter together, these months would assuredly pass separated one from the other: therefore while out walks the one, in steps the other.
3	1	10	Six times they perform  with, 'With theseason'--thereby the gods created the day; and four times with, 'With the seasons'--thereby they created the night. And, assuredly, were only this much (used), there would be nothing but night: it would never pass away.
3	1	11	Over and above they perform twice with the formula 'With the season;' thereby the gods subsequently gave the day (again), whence it is now day there, then it will be night, and to-morrow day.
3	1	12	By 'With the season' the gods forsooth created the men, and by 'With the seasons' the beasts; and because they created the beasts in the middle of those (men), therefore these beasts (cattle), being shut in on both sides, have come into the power of men.
3	1	13	And having performed six times with, 'With the season,' they both turn round their vessels to the other side; and having performed four times with, 'With the seasons,' they turn round their vessels to the other side: from the one side (or mouth) indeed the gods created the day, and from the other side the night; from the one side the gods created men, and from the other beasts.
3	1	14	Now he draws the cups (for the seasons)therefrom , with , 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for Madhu!' the Adhvaryu takes (the first); with 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for Mâdhava!' the Pratiprasthâtri (the second). These two are the spring (months ): because in spring plants sprout and trees are brought to ripeness, therefore these two are Madhu (sweet) and Mâdhava.
3	1	15	With 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for Sukra!' the Adhvaryu draws (the third); with 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for Suki!' the Pratiprasthâtri (the fourth). These two are the summer (months): because during them it burns fiercest, therefore these two are Sukra (clear) and Suki (bright).
3	1	16	With 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for Nabhas!' the Adhvaryu draws (the fifth); with 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for Nabhasya!' the Pratiprasthâtri (the sixth). These two are (the months) of the rainy season: it rains from yonder sky, and hence these two are Nabhas (mist, cloud) and Nabhasya.
3	1	17	With 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for Ish (sap)!' the Adhvaryu draws (the seventh); with 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for Ûrg (food)!' the Pratiprasthâtri (the eighth). These two are the autumn (months): because in autumn food (ûrg) and juice, (namely) plants, ripen, therefore these two are Isha and Ûrga.
3	1	18	With 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for Sahas!' the Adhvaryu draws (the ninth); with 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for Sahasya!' the Pratiprasthâtri (the tenth). These two are the winter (months): because the winter by force (sahas) brings these creatures into his power, therefore these two are Saha and Sahasya.
3	1	19	With 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for Tapas!' the Adhvaryu draws (the eleventh); with 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for Tapasya!' the Pratiprasthâtri (the twelfth). These two are (the months) of the dewy season: because during them it freezes most severely, therefore these two are Tapas and Tapasya.
3	1	20	With 'Thou art taken with a support: thee to Amhasaspati (lord of trouble)!' he (the Adhvaryu) draws the thirteenth libation, if he draw a thirteenth. The Pratiprasthâtri then pours his residue into the Adhvaryu's vessel, or the Adhvaryu pours his residue into the Pratiprasthâtri's vessel. He (the Adhvaryu) takes it (to the Sadas) for the purpose of drinking it .
3	1	21	Thereupon the Pratiprasthâtri draws the Aindrâgna graha with the vessel not used for the drinking. The reason why he draws the Aindrâgna libation with the vessel not used for drinking is thatno second Vashat is pronounced on the Ritugrahas, and for them he is about to take the Aindrâgna graha: thus they become consecrated for him by a second Vashat through the Aindrâgna.
3	1	22	And again, why he draws the Aindrâgna graha. By drawing the libations to the seasons he has generated this All, and having generated this All, he now establishes it on the out-breathing and in-breathing: hence this All is established on the out-breathing and in-breathing, for Indra and Agni are the out-breathing and in-breathing, and these two, heaven and earth, are the out-breathing and in-breathing, and within these two this All is established.
3	1	23	And again, why he draws the Aindrâgna cup. By drawing the libations to the seasons he has generated this All, and having generated this All, he lays the out-breathing and in-breathing into this All: hence these two, the out-breathing anti in-breathing, are laid into (or beneficial, hita, in) this All.
3	1	24	He now draws it from that (dronakalasa trough) with , 'O Indra and Agni, through our songs come ye hither to the Soma, to the agreeable fume: drink thereof, urged by our hymn!--Thou art taken with a support: thee to Indra and Agni!'--with 'This is thy womb: thee to Indra and Agni!' he deposits it (on the mound), for it is for Indra and Agni that he draws it.
3	1	25	Thereupon he draws the Vaisvadeva cup . For by drawing the Ritugrahas he has generated this All; but were there nothing but that, there would indeed be only as many, creatures as were created in the beginning: no (more) would be generated.
3	1	26	Now, in that he draws the Vaisvadeva graha, thereby he sends forth this All, these creatures in due order: whence these creatures are generated again repeatedly. He draws it with the Sukra cup, for the Sukra (bright) is yonder burning (sun), andwhat rays of his there are, they are the All-gods: therefore he draws it with the Sukra cup.
3	1	27	He draws it from that (Soma in the Dronakalasa) with , 'Ye protectors and supporters of men, O All-gods, come hither, ye givers, to the giver's liquor!--Thou art taken with a support: thee to the All-gods!' with 'This is thy womb: thee to the All-gods!' he deposits it , for it is for the All-gods that he draws it.
3	2	1	Now truly when the Hotri praises (recites the sastra ), he sings, and to him thus singing the Adhvaryu responds (prati-â-gar), whence the name response (pratigara).
3	2	2	calls upon that (Adhvaryu) seated (before him) with his face towards the east . For allothers except the Udgâtri perform their priestly duties while facing the east, and in this manner that priestly duty of his is performed towards the east.
3	2	3	Now the Udgâtri is Pragâpati, and the Hotri, (being) the Rik (fem.), is a female. And when he chants, then the Udgâtri, Pragâpati, implants seed in the female Hotri, the Rik; this the Hotri brings forth by means of the sastra (recitation), he sharpensit even as this man is sharpened , and because he thereby sharpens (so) therefore it is called sastra.
3	2	4	Having turned round (so as to face the Hotri, the Adhvaryu) then responds: thereby he quickens  that implanted seed. On the other hand, were he to respond while standing with his face turned away (from the Hotri), that implanted seed would assuredly perish away, and would not be brought forth; but thus facing each other (the male and female) bring forth the implanted seed.
3	2	5	Now the strength of the metres was exhausted by the gods, for it was by the metres that the gods attained the world of heaven. And the response (song) is ecstasy (mada )--what ecstasy there is in the rik and that which there is in the Sâman, that is sap: this sap he now lays into the metres, and thus makes the metres of restored strength; and with them of restored strength they perform the sacrifice.
3	2	6	Hence if (the Hotri) recites by half-verses, let (the Adhvaryu) respond at each half-verse; and if he recites by pâdas (hemistichs), let him respond at each pâda. For whenever, in reciting, he (the Hotri) draws breath, there the Asura-Rakshas rush into the sacrifice: there he (the Adhvaryu) closes it up by means of the response, so that the evil spirits, the Rakshas, cannot rush in; and thus he destroys the world of the sacrificer's enemies.
3	2	7	Now, in the beginning the metres consisted of four syllables. Then Gagatî flew up for Soma and came back, leaving behind three syllables. Then Trishtubh flew up for Soma and came back, leaving behind one syllable. Then Gâyatrî flew up for Soma, and she came back bringing with her those syllables as well as Soma. Thus she came to consist of eight syllables: wherefore they say, 'Gâyatrî is octosyllabic.'
3	2	8	With her they performed the morning feast of the Soma-sacrifice,--whence the morning feast pertains to Gâyatrî. With her they performed the midday feast. Trishtubh then said to her, 'To thee will I come with three syllables: invite me, and exclude me not from the sacrifice!'--'So be it!' she said and invited her. Thus the Trishtubh came to consist of eleven syllables, and therefore they say, 'The midday Soma feast pertains to Trishtubh.'
3	2	9	With her (Gâyatrî) indeed they performed the evening feast. Gagatî then said to her, 'To thee will I come with one syllable: invite me, and exclude me not from the sacrifice!'--'So be it!' she said and invited her. Thus the Gagatî came to consist of twelve syllables; and therefore they say, 'The evening Soma feast pertains to Gagatî.'
3	2	10	As to this they say, 'Surely all the Soma feasts pertain to Gâyatrî, since Gâyatrî alone went on increasing.' At the morning feast he should therefore respond with a complete (formula), for complete  Gâyatrî returned. At the midday feast (he responds with a formula) containing once (the verb) 'to rejoice (mad) ,' for she (Trishtubh) came back, leaving one syllable behind; and with that same (formula) he then completes her, makes her whole,
3	2	11	When trishtubh verses were recited. At the evening Soma feast (the Adhvaryu responds with a formula) containing thrice (the verb) 'to rejoice ,' for she (Gagatî) came back leaving three syllables behind; and with these (formulas) he then completes her, makes her whole,--
3	2	12	When (the hymn) to Heaven and Earth is recited . Now these creatures subsist on those two,the heaven and the earth--he thereby imbues those two, heaven and earth, with vigour; and upon those two, thus vigorous and affording the means of subsistence, these creatures subsist. Let him respond with 'Om!' only, for that is truth, that the gods know.
3	2	13	Now some respond with 'Othâmo daiva vâk,' saying, 'The response is speech (vâk): thus we obtain speech.' But let him not do this; for surely, in whichsoever way he may respond, speech is obtained by him, since he responds by speech. Let him therefore respond with 'Om !' only, for that is truth, that the gods know.
3	3	1	He presses out (the Soma juice) with 'Ihā̃! Ihā̃ !' (hither), whereby he draws Indra nigh; andwith 'Brihat! Brihat!' (great), whereby he draws Indra  nigh.
3	3	2	The Sukra and Manthin grahas he draws first, for thereby the Soma feast comes to be supplied with pure Soma (sukra). Thereupon the Âgrayana, for that (cup) is drawn at all (three) feasts. Then the Marutvatîya cup; then the Ukthya, for here also there are songs of praise (Uktha) .
3	3	3	Now some draw the Marutvatîya after they have drawn the Ukthya; but let him. not do this,--let him rather draw the Ukthya after he has drawn the Marutvatîya.
3	3	4	These, then, are five grahas he draws; for that midday Pavamâna chant is a thunderbolt: hence it is a fifteenfold five-hymned chant , for the thunderbolt is fifteenfold . He is so by means of these five grahas (cups of Soma ): for five are these fingers, and with the fingers he hurls (the thunderbolt).
3	3	5	Indra hurled the thunderbolt at Vritra; and having smitten Vritra, the wicked, and safety and peace being secured , he led forth the dakshinâs (gifts to priests). Wherefore now also, when they (the Udgâtris) chant the midday Pavamâna, and safety and peace are secured, the dakshinâs are led forth. And so, forsooth, does he now by means of those five cups of Soma hurl the thunderbolt at the wicked, hateful enemy, and having smitten Vritra, the wicked, and safety and peace beingsecured, he leads forth the dakshinâs. This is why he draws those five cups.
3	3	6	Then as to why he draws the Marutvatîya cups. Now this, the midday pressing feast, is Indra's special (nishkevalya) feast: thereby he strove to smite Vritra, thereby he strove to vanquish him. But the Maruts, having on that account  withdrawn, were standing on an Asvattha tree  (Ficus Religiosa). Now Indra is the nobility, and the Maruts are the people, and through the people the noble becomes strong: therefore the two Ritu cups (they say)  may be of asvattha wood; but in reality they are of kârshmarya wood.
3	3	7	Indra called on them, saying, 'Do ye join me that with you as my force I may smite Vritra!' They said, 'What will be our (reward) then?' He drew those two Marutvatîya cups for them.
3	3	8	They said, 'Having put aside this one (cup) for our vigour, we will join thee.' Having accordingly put it aside for their vigour , they joined him. But Indra sought to obtain it, thinking, 'They have come to me after putting aside their vigour.'
3	3	9	He said, 'Do ye join me with vigour!'--'Then draw a third cup for us;' they said. He drew a third cup for them, with, 'Thou art taken with a support,--thee for the vigour of the Maruts!' They then joined him with vigour,--and he conquered with them, and smote Vritra with them;--for Indra is the nobility, and the Maruts are the people, and through the people the noble becomes strong. Hence he now bestows that strength on the nobility, and therefore he draws the Marutvatîya cups.
3	3	10	Let him draw them for Indra Marutvat (accompanied by the Maruts), and not for the Maruts likewise. For were he also to draw cups for the Maruts, he would make the people refractory to the nobility. He thus assigns to the Maruts a share therein after Indra, whereby he makes the people subservient and obedient to the nobility: therefore let him draw the cups for Indra Marutvat, and not for the Maruts likewise.
3	3	11	But he was afraid of their desertion,--'Lest they should desert me, lest they should take to some other (party) ,' so thinking, he by that (share in the libation) made them unwilling to desert him. This is why he should draw the grahas for Indra Marutvat.
3	3	12	He draws them with the two vessels of the seasons, for the year, the sacrifice, means the seasons. There, at the morning Soma feast, they are overtly attended to, in that he draws the grahas for the seasons ; and now they are covertly attendedto, in that he draws the Marutvatîya grahas with the two vessels of the seasons.
3	3	13	He draws (the first) from that (stream of Soma) , with , 'O Indra, leader of the Maruts, drink thou the Soma here, as thou drankest of the liquor at (the sacrifice of) the Son of Saryâti: by thy guidance, in thy protection, O Lord, do the wise serve thee with good offerings!--Thou art taken with a support: thee to Indra Marutvat!--This is thy womb: thee to Indra Marutvat!'
3	3	14	Rig-veda III,
3	3	47	,
3	3	5	], 'The mighty bull, followed by the Maruts, the bountiful, divine ruler Indra,--him, the all-subduing, the terrible bestower of victory, do we now invoke for new favour.--Thou art taken with a support: thee to Indra Marutvat!--This is thy womb: thee to Indra Marutvat!'--with Thou arttaken with a support: thee for the strength of the Maruts!' he draws the third cup.
3	3	15	Thereupon he draws the Mâhendra cup. For Indra was then bound up with evil, in the shape of the people, the Maruts; as one might, for the sake of victory, eat from the same vessel with the people  so it was when they drew a cup for him in common with the Maruts.
3	3	16	When all was conquered and free from danger and injury, the gods plucked him from out of all evil--even as one might pluck out a reed from its sheath--when they drew the cup for the Great Indra. And even as the reed becomes leafless, so is he thereby freed from all evil, when one draws the Mâhendra cup.
3	3	17	And again, why he draws the Mâhendra cup. Before the slaughter of Vritra, he was indeed Indra; but when he had slain Vritra, he became the Great--Indra, even as one who has conquered all around, becomes a Great King (mahârâga): therefore he draws the Mâhendra cup. And, moreover, he forsooth make's him great for the slaughter of Vritra therefore also he draws the Mâhendra cup. He draws it in the Sukra vessel, for bright (sukra) and great indeed is he (the sun) that burns yonder: therefore he draws it in the Sukra vessel.
3	3	18	He thus draws it from that (Dronakalasa or Pûtabhrit), with , 'Great is Indra and hero-like, gladdening the people, of double stature and unimpaired in power. For our sake he waxed strong for heroic deed,--great and broad was he, andwell-shapen by the shapers .--Thou art taken with a support: thee to Mahendra!'--with 'This is thy womb: thee to Mahendra!' he deposits it; for it is indeed for the Great Indra that he draws it.
3	3	19	And having bespoken (the chant ), he says this speech,--'Pressers, press ye! make the mortarsresound! Agnîdh, stir the sour milk! be thou mindful of Soma's (pap)!' It is for the evening's press-feast that those pressers press out (the Soma juice), for the evening feast they make the mortars resound, for the evening feast the Agnîdh stirs the sour milk, for the evening feast he boils the pap for Soma. For these two press-feasts, the morning feast and the midday feast, are indeed rich in pure Soma, are rich in juice; but that third press-feast is emptied of the pure Soma. Hence he forms it from out of this midday feast; and thus that third press-feast becomes for him rich in pure Soma, rich in juice: this is why he now speaks that speech.
3	4	1	Now, they slay the sacrifice, when they spread (perform) it:--to wit, when they press out the king (Soma), they slay him; when they quiet the victim, they slay it; and with mortar and pestle, with the upper and nether millstone, they slay the havis offering.
3	4	2	When slain, that sacrifice was no longer vigorous. By means of dakshinâs (gifts to the priests) the gods invigorated it: hence the name dakshinâ, because thereby they invigorated (dakshay) it. Whatever, therefore, fails in this sacrifice, when slain, that he now invigorates by means of gifts to the priests; then the sacrifice becomes indeed successful: for this reason he makes gifts to the priests.
3	4	3	Now at the Haviryagña, indeed, they give as little as six or twelve (cows ), but no Soma-sacrifice should have dakshinâs of less than a hundred. Forhe, Pragâpati , forsooth, is the visible sacrifice; and man is nearest to Pragâpati, and he has a life of a hundred years, a hundred powers, a hundred energies. Only by a hundred he invigorates him, and not by less than a hundred: wherefore no Soma-sacrifice should have dakshinâs of less than a hundred; nor should any one officiate as a priest for a sacrificer at a (Soma-sacrifice) where less than a hundred are given,--'lest he should be an eyewitness when they will but slay and not invigorate him (Soma).'
3	4	4	Now, truly, there are two kinds of gods; for the gods, forsooth, are the gods; and the learned Brâhmans versed in sacred lore are the human gods. And the sacrifice to them is twofold, oblations (being the sacrifice) to the gods, and gifts to the priests being that to the human gods, to the learned Brâhmans versed in sacred lore. With oblations, forsooth, one gratifies the gods, and with gifts to the priests the human gods, the learned Brâhmans versed in sacred lore. These two kinds of gods, when gratified, convey him to the heavenly world.
3	4	5	But it is to the officiating priests, forsooth, that these gifts of his belong, for they prepare him another self,--to wit, this sacrifice, consisting of Rik and Yagus and Sâman and oblations,--that becomes his self in yonder world: 'It is they that have generated me,' from this (consideration) he should give the gifts to officiating priests and not to non-officiating.
3	4	6	Having gone back to the Gârhapatya fire , heoffers the gift offerings. Having tied a piece of gold in a fringed cloth , and laid it (into the spoon), he offers. 'May there be a place for me in the world of the gods!' With this hope he offers whoever offers: that same sacrifice of his goes to the world of the gods; and behind it goes the gift he gives to the priests, and holding on to the gift follows the sacrificer.
3	4	7	Now, there are four (kinds of) gifts to priests,--gold, the cow, cloth, and the horse. But it is not proper that he should lay a horse's foot or a cow's foot (into the spoon): hence he ties up a piece of gold in a fringed cloth, and having laid it (into the spoon) he offers.
3	4	8	He offers with two verses to the Sun. For yonder world is shut off by darkness; and dispelling the darkness by that light he reaches the heavenly world: therefore he offers with two verses to the Sun.
3	4	9	He offers with this gâyatrî verse , 'The lights bear on high that divine knower of beings, Sûrya, that all may see him,--Hail!'--for the gâyatrî is this earth, and she is a safe resting-place hence he thereby stands firmly on this safe resting-place.
3	4	10	He then makes the second offering with this trishtubh verse , 'The brilliant front  of the gods hath risen,the eye of Mitra, Varuna, and Agni: Sûrya, the soul of the movable and immovable, hath filled the heaven and the earth and the air,--Hail!' whereby he approaches the world (of the gods).
3	4	11	He then makes either one or two oblations on the Âgnîdhra (fire). The reason why he makes one or two oblations on the Âgnîdhra fire is that Agni rules over beasts (cattle) , and they lie round about him on every side: it is him he pleases by this oblation, and thus pleased he is gracious unto this (sacrificer), and the latter offers (to the priests a cow) graciously given up by him (Agni).
3	4	12	He offers with , 'O Agni, lead us on a good path unto wealth; thou, O god, that knowest all works! keep thou from us the sin that leadeth astray, and we will offer unto thee most ample adoration,--'Hail!' Thereupon, if he intends to give away a horse, harnessed or unharnessed, let him make a second oblation; but if not, he need not attend to this.
3	4	13	He offers with , 'May this Agni make wide room for us: may he march in front smiting the haters! May he gain riches in the winning of riches: may he, fiercely rushing, conquer the enemies! Hail!' for the horse is a winner of riches (spoils, prizes).
3	4	14	Thereupon, taking some gold, (the sacrificer)goes to the hall. South of the altar stand the Dakshinâ (cows). Standing in front of the hall, he respectfully addresses them  with , 'By your beauty have I come to beauty.' Now at first cattle did not submit to being given away. Laying aside their own beauteous forms  they approached with their (bare) bodies. The gods then went up to them from the offering ground with their (the animals’) own forms; and they, knowing their own forms, resigned themselves and became well-disposed to being given away. And in like manner does he now go up to them from the offering ground with their own forms; and they, knowing their own forms, resign themselves and become well-disposed to being given away.
3	4	15	'May the all-knowing Tutha distribute you!'--Now, Tutha is the Brahman: he thus distributes them by means of the Brahman. And the Brahman knows who is fit to receive a dakshinâ and who is unfit: thus these (cows) of his are given away only to him who is fit to receive a dakshinâ and not to him who is unfit.
3	4	16	'Go ye forward in the way of truth,'--for whosoever walks in the way of the gods, walks in the way of truth;--'ye of shining (kandra) gifts!' whereby they walk with that light (kandra, the moon).
3	4	17	He then goes to the Sadas, saying, 'Behold thou the heaven, behold the air!' whereby he means to say, 'May I through thee, the dakshinâ, see the (heavenly) world.'
3	4	18	Thereupon he looks on the Sadas, with, 'Unite with the Sadas-priests!' whereby he means to say, 'May the Sadas-priests not go beyond thee!'
3	4	19	He then takes the gold and goes up to the Âgnîdhra (fire-house), saying , 'May I this day obtain a Brâhman who has a father and forefathers!'--for he who is renowned and of renowned family, is one who has a father and forefathers; and by the gifts which he gives to a renowned (priest), though they be but few, he gains great things.--'A Rishi, the scion of Rishis,' for he who is renowned as learned in sacred lore, is a Rishi, the scion of Rishis;--'of well-bestowed gifts,' for he indeed is one on whom gifts are well-bestowed.
3	4	20	Having thus respectfully sat down by the Agnîdh, he gives him the gold, with 'Given (râta) by us, go ye to the gods!'--for whatever sacrificial gift he gives unhesitatingly, with a liberal (râta) mind, thereby he gains great things, 'Go ye to the gods,' he says, for he who sacrifices, sacrifices with the hope, 'May there be a place for me in the world of the gods;' and he thus makes him a sharer in the world of the gods.--'Enter ye to the Giver!' whereby he means to say, 'Enter ye into me!' and thus those (cows)  do not get lost to him. And as to his givinga dakshinâ first to the Agnîdh, it was from thence (from the Âgnîdhra)  that all the gods gained immortality: therefore he gives the dakshinâ first to the Agnîdh.
3	4	21	Then, approaching in the same way, he gives some gold to an Âtreya . For, at the time  when they recite the morning prayer, they were once upon a time singing praises here in front . Now Atri was the Hotri of the Rishis. Then the darkness of the Asuras came rushing into the Sadas. The Rishis said to Atri, 'Come back here, and dispel this darkness!' He dispelled that darkness; and thinking, 'He indeed is the light who has dispelled this darkness,' they brought him this light, gold, for a sacrificial gift,--for gold is indeed light; and by that same splendour and energy the Rishi dispelled the darkness. And so does he now also dispel the darkness by that light: therefore he bestows gold on an Âtreya.
3	4	22	Then to the Brahman, for the Brahman watches over the sacrifice from the south. Then to the Udgâtri (chanter); then to the Hotri; then to the two Adhvaryus, seated in the cart-shed. Then, having returned (to the Sadas he presents gold) to the Prastotri; then to the Maitrâvaruna; then to the Brâhmanâkhamsin; then to the Potri; then to the Neshtri; then to the Akhâvâka; then to the Unnetri; then to the Grâvastut; then to the Subrahmanyâ. To the Pratihartri he presents it last, since he is the restrainer(pratihartri) : he thus in the end restrains (the cows) for him, and so they do not become lost to him.
3	4	23	Thereupon he (the Adhvaryu) says (to the Maitrâvaruna), 'Recite (the invitatory prayer) to Indra, followed by the Maruts!' Now when, in the beginning, Pragâpati gave gifts, Indra thought within himself, 'Everything here, forsooth, he will give away, and not anything will he leave for us.' He then, to stop the giving, raised up that thunderbolt 'Recite to Indra Marutvat!' and thereafter he (Pragâpati) gave no more. And in like manner is that thunderbolt 'Recite to Indra Marutvat!' now raised up to stop the giving, and thereafter he (the sacrificer) gives no more.
3	4	24	; There are, then, four (kinds of) sacrificial gifts: Gold--thereby indeed he preserves his own life, for gold is life. That he (Pragâpati or Varuna) gaveto Agni, performing the office of the Agnîdh (fire-kindler): wherefore now also gold is given to the Agnîdh.
3	4	25	Then the Cow--thereby he preserves his own breath, for the cow is breath, since the cow is food, and breath also is food: her he gave to Rudra, the Hotri.
3	4	26	Then Cloth--thereby he preserves his own skin, for the cloth is skin: this he gave to Brihaspati, who chanted.
3	4	27	Then the Horse--for the horse is a thunderbolt: he thereby makes the thunderbolt the leader. And, moreover, he who sacrifices, sacrifices with the hope 'May there be a place for me in Yama's world!' He thus makes him a sharer in Yama's world. This he gave to Yama, the Brahman.
3	4	28	The (proffered) gold he (the Adhvaryu) goes to meet (accepts) with , 'Let Varuna give thee to me (who am) Agni!' for to Agni Varuna gave it. 'May I obtain immortality! be thou life to the giver, joy (mayas) to me, the receiver!'
3	4	29	And the cow he accepts with, 'Let Varuna give thee to me, Rudra!' for to Rudra Varuna gave her. 'May I obtain immortality! be thou breath to the giver, strength (vayas) to me, the receiver!'
3	4	30	And the cloth he accepts with, 'Let Varuna give thee to me, Brihaspati!' for to Brihaspati Varuna gave it. 'May I obtain immortality! be thou a skin to the giver, joy to me, the receiver!'
3	4	31	And the horse he accepts with, 'Let Varuna give thee to me, Yama!' for to Yama Varunagave it. 'May I obtain immortality! be thou a steed (hayah) to the giver, strength (vayas) to me, the receiver!'
3	4	32	And whatever other gift he gives that he gives with the hope, 'May I also have this in yonder world!' That he accepts with , 'Who hath given it? to whom hath he given it? Hope hath given it, for Hope hath he given it: Hope is the giver, Hope the receiver. This to thee, O Hope!' Thus he assigns it to a deity.
3	4	33	Here they say ,--Let him not assign it to any deity; for whatsoever deity he here kindles, that deity, being kindled, becomes ever more glorious from one day to the morrow; and to whatever fire he here adds fuel, that fire, being kindled, becomes ever more glorious from one day to the morrow; and ever more glorious does he become, whosoever, knowing this, accepts (a gift): even as one offers in kindled fire, so does he offer that (gift) which he gives to one learned in the scriptures. Therefore he who is learned in the scriptures need not assign (the gift to a deity).
3	5	1	Now there are three kinds of gods,--the Vasus, the Rudras, and the Âdityas. Between them the press-feasts are divided: the morning pressing belongs to the Vasus, the midday pressing to the Rudras, and the third pressing to the Âdityas. But the morning pressing belonged to the Vasus exclusively, and the midday pressing to the Rudras exclusively, and the third pressing to the Âdityas conjointly (with others).
3	5	2	The Âdityas then said, 'As that morning pressing belongs exclusively to the Vasus, and that midday pressing exclusively to the Rudras, so offer ye now to us a libation before the common (pressing).' The gods said, 'So be it!' After the completion of the midday pressing, they offered that (libation) previous to the third pressing . And in like manner is that libation offered to this day after the completion of the midday pressing and previous to the third pressing.
3	5	3	The Âdityas said, 'Neither in the one pressing have we a share nor in the other: we fear lest the Rakshas might injure us!'
3	5	4	They said to the (cups) belonging to two deities (dvidevatya ), 'We are afraid of the Rakshas: pray, let us enter into you!'
3	5	5	The Dvidevatyas said, 'What will be our reward then?'--'By us ye shall be supplied with the Anuvashat !', said the Âdityas.--'So be it!'--They entered into the dvidevatya cups.
3	5	6	Hence, when at the morning pressing he (the Adhvaryu) proceeds with the dvidevatya cups, the Pratiprasthâtri draws Soma juice from the Dronakalasa into the Âditya vessel, with this much (of the formula, Vâg. S. VIII, I), 'Thou art taken with a support!' The Adhvaryu calls for the (Agnîdh's) Sraushat, and after the Adhvaryu's libation the Pratiprasthâtri pours (his juice into the fire), and with this much 'Thee to the Âdityas!' he pours the remains (into the Âditya-sthâlî). In the same way at all (three dvidevatya libations).
3	5	7	Thus, the reason why the Pratiprasthâtri draws the Soma-juice, is that they entered into the dvidevatya cups. And the Âdityas then said, 'By us ye shall be supplied with the Anuvashat!' For, that second libation which he (the Pratiprasthâtri) makes, he makes to (Agni) Svishtakrit, and by means of the Svishtakrit these (dvidevatyas) are supplied with the Anuvashat; and thus those (libations) ofhis are supplied with the Anuvashat, having the (oblation to Agni) Svishtakrit performed for them. He offers on the north part (of the fire), for that is the region of that god : hence he offers on the north part.
3	5	8	And again, why the Pratiprasthâtri draws the Soma. They entered into the Dvidevatyas; and from those which they entered he thereby draws them out. He then covers it --for they were afraid of the Rakshas--with 'O Vishnu, Far-strider, here is thy Soma, protect it lest they should injure it!' For Vishnu is the sacrifice: to the sacrifice he thus makes it over for protection. Now, after the completion of the midday Soma feast and before the evening feast he says, 'Come hither, Sacrificer!'
3	5	9	They enter (the Havirdhâna) together,--the Adhvaryu, Sacrificer, Âgnîdhra, Pratiprasthâtri, Unnetri, and whatever other attendant (of the Adhvaryu) there is . They close both doors,--for they (the Âdityas) were afraid of the Rakshas. He (the Adhvaryu) takes up the Âditya-sthâlî and Âditya-pâtra, and holds them close over the Pûtabhrit, 'lest (any Soma juice) should be spilt.'
3	5	10	He then draws (the juice from the sthâlî into the pâtra) with , 'At no time art thou barren, and never failest thou the worshipper, O Indra; butmore and ever more is thy divine gift increased, O mighty lord!--Thee to the Âdityas!'
3	5	11	Let him not draw it with a 'support'--for it was originally drawn with a support--to avoid a repetition (of sacrificial performance); but were he now also to draw it with a support, he would certainly commit a repetition.
3	5	12	Having withdrawn (the cup for a moment from the flowing juice), he again pours it in with , 'At no time art thou heedless, but watchest over both generations; the Soma feast  is thy strength, O fourth Âditya: the ambrosia is ready for thee in the heavens!--Thee to the Âdityas!'
3	5	13	Thereupon he takes sour milk; for the evening pressing belongs to the Âdityas, and cattle are after (the manner of) the Âdityas : he thereby puts milk into the cattle, and thus that milk in cattle is beneficial . 'He should put it right in the centre (of the Âditya cup),' they say, 'for that milk is right in the centre of cattle.' But let him rather put it in the back part (of the cup), for that milk is in the hind part of cattle.
3	5	14	And the reason why he takes sour milk is that those remains (of Soma) poured together are the leavings of offerings, and insufficient for an oblation: he now increases those (remains), and thus theybecome sufficient for an oblation. This is why he takes sour milk.
3	5	15	He takes it with , 'The sacrifice draweth nigh to the glory of the gods: be ye merciful, O Âdityas! Let your favour incline unto us, that it may set us free from all trouble!--Thee to the Âdityas!'
3	5	16	He mixes it by means of the Upâmsusavana stone . For, indeed, that Âditya Vivasvat (the sun) is really the same as the Upâmsusavana, and this is the Âditya libation: thus he makes him delight in his own share.
3	5	17	He touches it neither with the fringe nor with (the woven part of) the straining-cloth; for those two pressings, the morning pressing and midday pressing, forsooth are rich in pure Soma, rich in juice, but this, the third pressing, is emptied of its pure Soma. Now, in that he does not touch it either with the fringe or the straining-cloth, thereby that third pressing of his also becomes rich in pure Soma and juice: therefore he touches it neither with the fringe nor with the straining-cloth.
3	5	18	He mixes it with , 'O Âditya Vivasvat, this is thy draught of Soma: feast thou upon it!' Thereupon he hands the Upâmsusavana to the Unnetri. Then he says to the Unnetri, 'Drop in the pressing-stones!' He drops them either into the Âdhavanîya or into a cup .
3	5	19	After drawing the king (Soma)--the third press-feast belonging to the Âdityas, and the pressing-stones being after (the manner of ) the Âdityas, he thus makes them delight in their own share--they open the doors.
3	5	20	He now walks out, covering (the cup with his hand or the sthâlî); for they (the Âdityas) were afraid of the Rakshas. He then says (to the Maitrâvaruna), 'Recite (the invitatory prayer) to the Âdityas!' If he likes, he may now enumerate (their qualities); but let him rather enumerate them, after he has called for the Sraushat,--'Prompt (the Hotri to recite the offering prayer) to the Âdityas, the beloved, rite-loving, law-loving lords of the great abode, the rulers of the wide air.' He offers, as the Vashat is pronounced. He (the Hotri) pronounces no Anuvashat, lest he should consign the cattle to the fire. The remains (of juice in the sthâlî and graha) he (the Adhvaryu) hands to the Pratiprasthâtri.
3	5	21	Thereupon he again enters (the Havirdhâna) and draws the Âgrayana graha . They spread (over the Pûtabhrit) a straining-cloth with the fringe towards the north. The Adhvaryu pours out (thejuice) of the Âgrayana; the Pratiprasthâtri holds out (and pours in) the two residues (of the Âditya graha ); the Unnetri adds thereto (some juice from the Âdhavanîya) by means of a kamasa cup or a dipping-vessel (udañkana).
3	5	22	Thus he draws the Âgrayana graha from four streams; for the evening pressing belongs to the .Âdityas, and cows are after the manner of the Âdityas; whence this milk of cows is of a fourfold nature: therefore he draws the Âgrayana from four streams .
3	5	23	And as to why the Pratiprasthâtri holds out the two residues: this is (the remains of) the Âditya libation, and for the Âditya libation he pronounces no Anuvashat; and from that (Âgrayana graha) he intends to draw the Sâvitra graha,--so that the Anuvashat is performed for it by means of the Sâvitra graha.
3	5	24	And again why the Pratiprasthâtri holds out the two residues. Previous to that mixed (press-feast), previous to the evening feast, they have offered that (unmixed or special) libation to those (Âdityas); but this libation is taken for the evening feast: thereby the Âdityas take part in the evening feast, and thus they are not excluded from the sacrifice. This is why the Pratiprasthâtri holds out the two residues .
4	1	1	Savitri, forsooth, is his  mind: therefore he draws the Sâvitra cup. And, forsooth, Savitri is his breath (vital air);--when he draws the Upâmsu cup, then he puts into him that vital air in front; and when he draws the Sâvitra cup, then he puts into him that vital air behind: thus those two vital airs on both sides are beneficial (or, put into him), both that which is above and that which is below.
4	1	2	And the sacrifice, forsooth, is the seasons, the year. There, at the morning feast, they are overtly attended to, in that he draws the cups for the seasons; and at the midday feast they are covertly attended to, in that he takes the Marutvatîya libations by means of the two Ritu vessels . Now here (at the evening feast) they neither draw any libation expressly for the seasons, nor is any libation taken with the two Ritu vessels.
4	1	3	But Savitri, forsooth, is he that burns yonder (the sun); and he indeed is all the seasons: thus the seasons, the year, are overtly attended to at the evening feast,--for this reason he draws the Sâvitra cup.
4	1	4	He draws it with the Upâmsu vessel. For Savitri is his mind, and the Upâmsu is his breath: therefore he draws it with the Upâmsu vessel; or with the Antaryâma vessel, for that is one and the same, since the Upâmsu and Antaryâma are the out-breathing and in-breathing .
4	1	5	He draws it from the Âgrayana graha; for Savitri is his mind, and the Âgrayana is his body (or self): he thus puts the mind into the body. Savitri is his breath, and the Âgrayana is his body: he thus puts the breath into the body.
4	1	6	He thus draws it therefrom with , 'Bring thou forth boons for us this day, O Savitar, boons to-morrow, boons day by day: O God, through this our prayer may we be sharers of boons, of a good and plenteous abode!--Thou art taken with a support!--Thou art Savitri's joy-giver, thou art a joy-giver: give me joy! speed the sacrifice; speed the lord of the sacrifice to (receive) his share!'
4	1	7	Having drawn it, he does not deposit it; for Savitri is his (Yagña's) mind, and hence this mind is restless. And Savitri is his breath: hence this breath passes to and fro unrestingly. He then says (to the Maitrâvaruna), 'Recite (the invitatory prayer) to the god Savitri!' Having called for the Sraushat, he says, 'Prompt (the Hotri to recite the offering prayer) to the god Savitri!' The Vashat having been pronounced, he offers. He (the Hotri) pronounces no Anuvashat ,--for Savitri is his mind,--'lest he should consign his mind to the fire;' and Savitri being his breath,--'lest he should consign his breath to the fire.'
4	1	8	Then with the (same) vessel, without drinking therefrom , he draws the Vaisvadeva graha. The reason why he draws the Vaisvadeva graha with the (same) vessel, without drinking therefrom, is this: on the Sâvitra graha he (the Hotri) pronounces no Anuvashat, and it is therefrom that he is about to draw the Vaisvadeva graha,--thus it is by means of the Vaisvadeva that it becomes supplied with the Anuvashat for him.
4	1	9	And further why he draws the Vaisvadeva graha. Savitri, forsooth, is his rind, and the Visve Devâh (All-gods, or all the gods ) are everything here: he thus makes everything here subservient and obedient to the mind, and hence everything here is subservient and obedient to the mind.
4	1	10	And again why he draws the Vaisvadeva graha. Savitri, forsooth, is his breath, and the All-gods are everything here: he thereby puts the out-breathing and in-breathing into everything here, andthus the out-breathing and in-breathing become beneficial (or put) in everything here.
4	1	11	And again why he draws the Vaisvadeva graha. The evening feast belongs to the All-gods: thus indeed it is called on the part of the Sâman, in that the evening feast is called Vaisvadeva on the part of the Rik , and in the same way on the part of the Yagus, by way of preparatory rite, when he draws that Mahâ-vaisvadeva graha.
4	1	12	He draws it from the Pûtabhrit; for the Pûtabhrit belongs to the All-gods, because therefrom they draw (Soma juice) for the gods, therefrom for men, therefrom for the Fathers: hence the Pûtabhrit belongs to the All-gods.
4	1	13	He draws it without a puroruk , for he draws it for the All-gods, and the All-gods are everything, the Rik and Yagus and Sâman; and even in that he draws it for the All-gods, thereby it becomes supplied with a puroruk for him: therefore he draws it without a puroruk.
4	1	14	He thus draws it therefrom with , 'Thou art taken with a support: thou art well-guarded, well-established,'--for well-guarded and well-established is the breath,--'homage to the great bull!'--the great bull is Pragâpati (the lord of creatures): 'homage to Pragâpati,' he thereby means to say.--'Thee to the All-gods! this is thy womb,--thee to the All-gods!' Therewith hedeposits it; for it is for the All-gods that he draws it. Thereupon he goes (to the Sadas) and sits down (in front of the Hotri) with his face to the east .
4	1	15	And when he (the Hotri) recites this (verse), 'With one and ten for thine own sake, with two and twenty for offering, with three and thirty for up-bearing (the sacrifice to the gods); with thy teams, O Vâyu, do thou here unloose them!'--during (the recitation of) this verse to Vâyu the drinking-vessels are unyoked , for beasts have Vâyu for their leader; and Vâyu (wind) is breath, since it is by means of the breath that beasts move about.
4	1	16	Now once on a time he went away from the gods with the beasts. The gods called after him at the morning pressing,--he returned not. They called after him at the midday pressing,--but he returned not. They called after him at the evening pressing.
4	1	17	Being about to return, he said, 'If I were to return to you, what would be my reward? '--'By thee these vessels would be yoked, and by thee they would be unloosed!'--Hence those vessels are yoked by that (Vâyu), when he (the Adhvaryu) draws the (cups) for Indra and Vâyu and so forth . And now those vessels are unloosed by him, when he says, 'with thy teams, O Vâyu, do thou here unloose them;'--teams mean cattle: thus he unlooses those vessels by means of cattle.
4	1	18	Now, had he returned at the morning pressing--the morning pressing belonging to the Gâyatrî, and the Gâyatrî being the priesthood --then cattle would have come to be with priests only. And had he returned at the midday pressing--the midday pressing belonging to Indra, and Indra being the nobility--cattle would have come to be with nobles only. But in that he returned at the evening pressing--the evening pressing belonging to the All-gods, and the All-gods being everything here--therefore there are cattle everywhere here.
4	2	1	He proceeds with (the offering of) Soma's rice-pap; for Soma is the sacrificial food of the gods; and here now sacrificial food is prepared for Soma on his part; and thus Soma is not excluded therefrom. It is a rice-pap (karu), for rice-pap is food for the gods, since rice-pap is boiled rice, and boiled rice is clearly food: therefore it is a rice-pap.
4	2	2	Neither at the morning feast, nor at the midday feast does he offer it, for those two press-feasts, the morning feast and the midday feast, are the exclusive feasts of the gods; and Soma is sacred to the Fathers .
4	2	3	But were he to offer it at the morning feast, or at the midday feast, he would cause discord between the gods and Fathers. He offers it at the evening feast, because the evening feast belongs to the All-gods : thus he does not cause discord. He recites no invitatory prayer (but only an offering prayer), for the Fathers have passed away once for all: hence he recites no invitatory prayer.
4	2	4	Having, in the first place, taken ghee in four ladlings, and having called (on the Agnîdh) for the Sraushat, he says, 'Recite the offering prayer of the ghee!' and offers as the Vashat is uttered. Whatever oblations have been offered previous to this (karu), therefrom he separates this one (to Soma), and thus he causes no discord.
4	2	5	Having poured (into the spoon) an 'underlayer' of ghee, he makes two cuttings from the rice-pap; and bastes them with ghee above. Having called for the Sraushat, he says, 'Recite the offering prayer of the Saumya (rice-pap)!' and offers as the Vashat is uttered.
4	2	6	He then takes ghee a second time by four ladlings, and having called for the Sraushat, he says, 'Recite the offering prayer of the ghee!' and offers as the Vashat is uttered. From whatever oblations he intends to offer hereafter, he thereby separates this one (to Soma), and thus he causes no discord. If he chooses, he may offer (ghee) on both sides (before and after the Soma's rice-pap); or, if he chooses, he may offer on one side only .
4	2	7	Now there is an offering-spoon called 'prakaranî.' Therein the Adhvaryu takes ghee by four ladlings (with the dipping-spoon) and pours it on the Dhishnya hearths by means of fagots (held over them). The reason why he pours ghee on the hearths by means of fagots is this. Because, on a former occasion , the gods said to those (Gandharva Soma-wardens), 'At the third pressing an offering of ghee shall fall to your share, but not one of Soma, for the Soma-draught has been taken from you, wherefore ye are not worthy of a Soma-offering,' that same offering of ghee now falls to their share at the evening pressing, but not one of Soma, in that he pours ghee on the hearths by means of fagots. One after another, in the order in which they were thrown up, and with the same formulas , he pours ghee upon them; on the Mârgâlîya last of all.
4	2	8	Now some make a second pouring on the Âgnîdhrîya hearth, thinking, 'In the North (or upwards) shall this sacred work of ours be accomplished!' but let him not do it in this way, but rather the Mârgâlîya last .
4	2	9	Now, while the Adhvaryu pours ghee on the hearths by means of fagots, the Pratiprasthâtri draws the Pâtnîvata  cup. For from the sacrifice creatures are produced; and being produced from the sacrifice, they are produced from union; and being produced from union, they are produced from the hind part of the sacrifice;--hence he thereby produces them from a productive union, from the hind part of the sacrifice: therefore he draws the Pâtnîvata cup.
4	2	10	He draws it with the Upâmsu vessel. If hedraws the Sâvitra libation with the Upâmsu vessel, (he draws) this one with the Antaryâma vessel; and if he draws the Sâvitra with the Antaryâma vessel (he draws) this one with the Upâmsu vessel;--for one and the same indeed are the Upâmsu and Antaryâma, being breath, and that which is the out-breathing is also the in-breathing. Now the breath (prâna, masc.) is male, and the wife is female: a productive union is thus brought about.
4	2	11	He draws it without a puroruk ,---the puroruk being manhood,--lest he should bestow manhood on women: therefore he draws it without a puroruk.
4	2	12	He thus draws it from that (Âgrayana graha) with , 'Thou art taken with a support: Of thee, divine Soma, begotten by Brihaspati'--Brihaspati is the priesthood: of thee, divine Soma, the priest-begotten' he thereby means to say--'Of thee, the potent juice of the powerful (manly) juice' he means to say when he says 'of thee, the potent juice'--'May I prosper the draughts of thee, the mated one !' he does not now draw it for the wives, lest he should bestow manhood on women: therefore he does not now draw it for the wives.
4	2	13	He (the Adhvaryu) then mixes it with the residue (of ghee) which is left in the prakaranî spoon. Now other libations he completes by mixing, but this one he diminishes; for ghee is a thunderbolt,and by that thunderbolt, the ghee, the gods smote the wives and unmanned them, and thus smitten and unmanned they neither owned any self nor did they own any heritage. And in like manner does he now, by that thunderbolt, the ghee, smite the wives and unman them; and thus smitten and unmanned, they neither own  any self nor do they own any heritage.
4	2	14	He mixes it, with , 'I am above, I am below; and what space there is between, that was my father;--I saw the sun on both sides: I am what is highest to the gods in secret.' In that he mixes with 'I--I,' thereby he bestows manhood on men.
4	2	15	He then says, 'Agnîdh, pronounce the offering prayer of the Pâtnîvata!' The Agnîdh is male, and the wife is female: thus a productive union is brought about. He offers with , 'O Agni, wife-leader !'--Agni is male, and the wife is female: thus a productive union is brought about.
4	2	16	'Together with the divine Tvashtri'--for Tvashtri transforms the cast seed: thus he thereby transforms the cast seed;--'drink the Soma, Hail!' therewith he offers on the north (left) part (of the fire); what other offerings there are, they are the gods, and these are the wives: thus alone it is a proper union, since the woman lies on the left (north) side of the man. The Adhvaryu takes a draught of Soma to the Agnîdh, and the latter says, 'Adhvaryu, invite me!'  he should not invite him, since how can there be an invitation of one smitten and unmanned? He should nevertheless invite him: they offer in his fire, and utter the Vashat,--therefore he should invite him.
4	2	17	He then gives orders, 'Agnîdh, sit in the Neshtri's lap! Neshtri, lead up the lady, and make her exchange looks with the Udgâtri! Unnetri, fill up the Hotri's cup, and let no Soma-juice remain!' Thus, if it be an Agnishtoma sacrifice.
4	2	18	But if it be an Ukthya , let him say, 'Lengthen out the Soma!'--Holding the same vessel (from which the Pâtnîvata libation was made, the Agnîdh) sits down in the Neshtri's lap,--for he, the Agnîdh, is in reality Agni, and the Neshtri is female: the Agnîdh is male, and the Neshtri female,--a productive union is thus brought about. The Neshtri leads up the lady and makes her exchange looks with the Udgâtri , with 'Thou art Pragâpati, themale, the bestower of seed: lay thou seed into me!' The Udgâtri is Pragâpati, and the lady is a woman: a productive union is thus brought about.
4	3	1	The metres, forsooth, are the (draught) cattle of the gods. Even as harnessed cattle here on earthdraw for men, so do the harnessed metres draw the sacrifice for the gods. And whenever the metres gratified the gods, then the gods gratified the metres. Now it has been previous to this, that the harnessed metres have drawn the sacrifice to the gods, that they have gratified them :
4	3	2	He now draws the Hâriyogana  graha--the Hâriyogana being the metres--it is the metres he thereby gratifies: this is why he draws the Hâriyogana graha.
4	3	3	He draws it as an additional (libation); sincehe draws it when he (the Hotri) pronounces the 'All-hail and blessing .' For there are here the gods, and the metres in addition to them; and there are men, and beasts in addition to them: therefore he draws it as an additional one.
4	3	4	He draws it in the Dronakalasa. Now Soma was Vritra. When the gods slew him, his head rolled off : it became the Dronakalasa. Thereinto flowed together so much of the juice as it could hold ; that was in excess; and so is this graha in excess: he thus puts the excess. to the excess,--therefore he draws it in the Dronakalasa.
4	3	5	He draws it without a puroruk-formula, for he draws it for the metres; and in that he draws it for the metres, even thereby that (graha) of his becomes supplied with a puroruk: therefore he draws it without a puroruk.
4	3	6	He now draws it from that (Âgrayana graha) with (Vâg. S. VIII, it), 'Thou art taken with a support: of bay colour art thou, meet for the team of bay steeds,--thee to the pair of bay steeds!' Now, the two bay horses are the Rik and Sâman: it is for the Rik and Sâman that he draws it.
4	3	7	He then pours parched grain into it with, 'Ye are the bays’ grains, united with the Soma for Indra!' Whatever metres there are, both measured and unmeasured, they all thereby drink (of the Soma ).
4	3	8	For this (libation) the Unnetri  calls for the Sraushat;--for the Unnetri is in excess (additional), since he does not call for the Sraushat for any other (libation); and this libation also is in excess: thus he puts the excess to the excess,--therefore the Unnetri calls for the Sraushat.
4	3	9	Placing (the Dronakalasa) on his head, he calls for the Sraushat,--for this (vessel) is his (Soma's) head. He first says (to the Maitrâvaruna), 'Recite (the invitatory prayer) for the Soma-draughts with grains!' Having called for the Sraushat, he says, 'Prompt (the Hotri to pronounce the offering prayer on) the Soma-draughts with grain brought forward !' and offers as the Vashat and Anuvashat are uttered. They then divide the grain between them for the sake of the Soma-draught.
4	3	10	Now some take the Dronakalasa over to the Hotri, on the ground that 'the draught belongs to the utterer of the Vashat.' But let him not do it thus; for the other draughts are (taken by the respective priests) according to the kamasa cups, but this one is in excess: therefore there is a draught in it for all of them,--for this reason they divide the grain between them for the sake of the Soma-draught.
4	3	11	They must not bite them with their teeth,--for these (grains) mean cattle,--thinking 'lest we should do aught to crush our cattle!' They only drink it in with their breath , with , 'What horse-winning, what cow-winning draught is thine ;' for they are cattle: therefore he says, 'what horse-winning, what cow-winning draught is thine;'--'Of that draught, offered with Yagus, praised by chants ,'--for Yagus-prayers have indeed been offered, and chants have been chanted;--'sung by hymns,'--for songs (sastras) have been sung;--'Of the invited  do I drink, invited,'--for invited, he now drinks of the invited.
4	3	12	They must not throw them into the fire, lest they offer remains (of offerings) in the fire. They rather throw them on the high altar: thus they are not excluded from the sacrifice.
4	3	13	Thereupon they touch the vessels filled (with water ) which some call Apsushomâh (Soma-draughts in water). For even as a yoked (animal) draws, sodo they who perform the priestly duties. But the yoked (animal) galls or scratches itself; and water is a means of soothing, a medicine: thus wherever in this (sacrifice) they gall or scratch themselves--water being a means of soothing--they soothe by that means of soothing, water; they heal it by water. This is why they touch the vessels filled (with water).
4	3	14	They touch them with , 'With lustre, with sap, with bodies  have we united,--with the happy spirit: may Tvashtri, the dispenser of boons, grant us riches, and may he smooth what was injured in our body!' thus they heal what was torn.
4	3	15	They then touch their faces. There is a twofold reason why they touch their faces;--water, forsooth, is the elixir of immortality: it is with the elixir of immortality that they thus touch themselves. And, moreover, they thus deposit that holy work into their own self: therefore they touch their faces.
4	4	1	Now, it is nine Samishtayagus  he offers on this occasion. The reason why he offers nine Samishtayagus is that those stotra-verses at the Bahishpavamâna  chant amount to nine. Thus there is at both ends an inferior (incomplete) virâg , for thesake of production: it was from that same inferior (lower) source of production on both sides that Pragâpati produced the creatures,--from the one (he created) the upright, and from the other those tending to the ground. And in like manner does he (the Adhvaryu) now create creatures from that lower source of production on both sides,--from the one the upright, and from the other those tending to the ground.
4	4	2	The call 'Him' is the tenth of stotra-verses, and the 'Svâhâ' (the tenth) of these (Samishtayagus): and thus does this incomplete virâg come to consist of tens and tens.
4	4	3	And as to why they are called Samishtayagus. Whatever deities he invites at this sacrifice, and for whatever deities this sacrifice is performed, they all are thereby 'sacrificed-to together' (sam-ishta); and because, after all those (deities) have been 'sacrificed-to together,' he now offers those (libations), therefore they are called Samishtayagus.
4	4	4	And as to why he offers the Samishtayagus. Now, the self of him who has sacrificed has, as it were, become emptied, since he gives away of whatever is his: it is him he fills again by three out of these (oblations).
4	4	5	And as to the three following which he offers,--whatever deities he invites at this sacrifice, and for whatever deities this sacrifice is performed, they continue waiting till the Samishtayagus are performed, thinking, 'These, forsooth, he must offer unto us!' It is these same deities he thereby dismisses in due form whithersoever their course lies.
4	4	6	And as to the three last which he offers,--in performing the sacrifice he has produced it, and,having produced it, he firmly establishes it where there is a safe resting-place for it: this is why he performs the Samishtayagus.
4	4	7	He offers (the first) with , 'With thought lead us, O Indra, to meet with kine,'--'with thought him who was emptied he thereby fills with thought; with kine;' him who was emptied he thereby fills with kine;--'with patrons, O mighty Lord, with well-being; with prayer which is divinely inspired ,'--'with prayer:' him who was emptied he thereby fills with prayer;--'with the favour of the adorable gods! Hail!'
4	4	8	, 'With lustre, with sap, with bodies,'--'with lustre him who was emptied he thereby fills with lustre; with sap,'--sap is vigour--him who was emptied he thus fills with sap;--'We have united, with the happy spirit: may Tvashtri, the dispenser of boons, grant us riches, and may he smooth what was injured in our body!' Thus they heal what was torn.
4	4	9	, 'May the gracious Dhâtri, Savitri, Pragâpati, the guardian of treasures, and the divine Agni accept this (offering); and Tvashtri and Vishnu: grant ye willingly to the sacrificer wealth together with children! Hail!' Him who was emptied he fills again, when he says, 'grant ye wealth to the sacrificer, Hail!'
4	4	10	, 'Accessible homes have we prepared for you, O gods, who graciously came to this Soma feast;'--whereby he means to say, 'seats easy of access we have prepared for you, O gods, who have graciously come to this Soma feast;'--'Carrying and driving the offerings,' thereby he dismisses the several deities; 'Those forsooth who are without cars may go away carrying; and those who have cars may go away driving,' this is what he means to say; therefore he says, 'Carrying and driving the offerings;'--'bestow goods on him, ye good! Hail!'
4	4	11	, 'The willing gods whom thou, O God, broughtest hither, speed them each to his own abode, O Agni!' For to Agni he said, 'Bring hither such and such gods! bring hither such and such gods!' and to him he now says, 'Whatever gods thou hast brought hither, make them go whithersoever their course lies!'--'Ye have all eaten and drunk,'--for they have eaten the cakes of the animal offering, and they have drunk the king Soma: therefore he says, 'ye have all eaten and drunk;'--'Draw ye nigh to the air, to the heat, to the light! H ail!' Hereby, then, he dismisses the deities.
4	4	12	, 'Thee, O Agni, have we chosen here for our Hotri at the opening of this sacrifice: severally hast thou offered to them, and severally hast thou toiled; well-knowing the sacrifice, draw thou nigh , thou the wise! Hail!' by this (verse) he releases Agni, dismisses Agni.
4	4	13	, 'Ye path-finding gods,'--for the gods are, indeed, the finders of the path;--'having found the path,'--'having found the sacrifice,' he thereby means to say;--'go ye in the path!' therewith he dismisses them in due form;--'O divine Lord of mind, this sacrifice--Svâhâ!--give thou to the wind!' for the sacrifice, indeed, is yonder blowing (wind): having thus completed this sacrifice, he establishes it in that sacrifice, and thus unites sacrifice with sacrifice,--hence he says, 'Svâhâ! give (it) to the wind!'
4	4	14	, 'O sacrifice, go to the sacrifice, go to the lord of the sacrifice, go to thine own womb, Hail!'--the sacrifice, thus established, he thereby establishes in its own womb. , 'This is thy sacrifice, O lord of the sacrifice, bestowing numerous heroes, together with the song of praise: do thou accept it, Hail!' the sacrifice, thus established, bestowing numerous heroes, together with the song of praise he thereby finally establishes in the sacrificer.
4	5	1	He now betakes himself to the expiatory bath (avabhritha). The reason why he betakes himself to the expiatory bath is this. What vital sap there has been in him (Soma and the sacrificer), that (sap) of his he (the priest) has produced (extracted) for the offerings. Now that body (of Soma, i.e.the Soma-husks),--there is no sap in it; (yet) it is not to be cast away: they take it down to the water and--water being sap--he puts that sap into it. Thus he unites him with that sap, and thus he produces him from it,--he (Soma), even when produced, produces him (the sacrificer) : and because they take it down (ava-hri ) to the water, therefore (the bath is called) avabhritha.
4	5	2	In the first place he performs the Samishtayagus offerings, for the Samishtayagus are the extreme end of the sacrifice. As soon as he has performed the Samishtayagus, they go together to the kâtvâla (pit) with whatever he (the sacrificer) has about him : both the black-deer's horn  and the girdle he throws into the pit,--
4	5	3	With , 'Be thou nor adder nor viper!' Now when they take the Soma-husks down to the water, that forsooth is the wishing of 'good-speed !' to it, and this now is the 'good-speed!' to him (the sacrificer); for snakes are like rope, and snakes' haunts are like wells (pits), and there is as it were a feud between men and snakes: 'Lest that should spring therefrom,' he thinks, and therefore he says, 'Be thou nor adder nor viper!'
4	5	4	He then makes (the sacrificer) say , 'Broad forsooth is the path which king Varuna hath made for the sun to walk along,'--whereby he means to say, 'even as there is for the sun that broad path, free from danger and injury, so may there be for me here a broad path, free from danger and injury.'
4	5	5	'For the footless hath he made feet to put down ,' for, although he (the sun) is footless, yet he is able to walk;--'And the forbidder is he of all that woundeth the heart,'--thus he frees him from every guilt and evil of the heart.
4	5	6	He then says, 'Sing the Sâman!' or 'Speak the Sâman!' but let him rather say 'Sing,' for they do sing the Sâman. The reason why he sings the Sâman is that the evil spirits may not injure that body of his outside the sacrifice, for the Sâman is a repeller of the evil spirits.
4	5	7	He (the Prastotri) sings a (verse) to Agni, for Agni is a repeller of the evil spirits. He sings in the Atikhandas; for this, the Atikhandas, is all the metres : therefore he sings in the Atikhandas.
4	5	8	He sings, 'Agni burneth, Agni encountereth with flames,--Ahâvah! Ahâvah !' Thus he drives the evil spirits away from here.
4	5	9	They walk out (from the sacrificial ground) northwards, along the back of the pit and the front side of the Âgnîdhra: then they proceed in whatever direction the water is.
4	5	10	Where there is a standing pool of flowing water, there let him (the sacrificer) descend into the water--for whatsoever parts of flowing water flow not, these are holden by Varuna; and the expiatory bath belongs to Varuna--to free himself from Varuna. But if he does not find such, he may descend into any water.
4	5	11	While he makes him descend into the water, he bids him say, 'Homage be to Varuna: downtrodden is Varuna's snare!' thus he delivers him from every snare of Varuna, from every (infliction ) of Varuna.
4	5	12	Thereupon, taking ghee in four ladlings, and throwing down a kindling-stick (on the water), he offers thereon, with , 'The face of Agni, the waters, have I entered, escaping from the power of demons, O son of the waters! In every homestead offer thou the log, O Agni! let thy tongue dart forth towards the ghee,--Hail!'
4	5	13	Now, once on a time, the gods made so much of Agni, as would go in , enter the water, in order that the evil spirits should not rise therefrom; for Agni is the repeller of evil spirits. It is him he kindles by this kindling-stick and by thisoblation, thinking 'On the kindled (fire) will I offer to the gods!'
4	5	14	Then, having taken ghee a second time in four ladlings, and having called for the (Âgnîdhra's) Sraushat, he says, 'Pronounce the offering prayer to the Kindling-sticks!' He offers four fore-offerings, omitting that to the Barhis --the Barhis being offspring, and the expiatory bath belonging to Varuna--lest Varuna should seize upon his offspring. This is why he offers four fore-offerings, omitting that to the Barhis.
4	5	15	Then follows a cake on one potsherd for Varuna. For whatever sap there had been in him (Soma), that sap of his he has produced (extracted) for the offerings. Now that body: there is no sap in it. But the cake is sap: that sap he puts into it. Thus he unites him with that sap, and so produces him from it,--he (Soma), even when produced, produces him (the sacrificer): hence there is a cake on -one potsherd for Varuna.
4	5	16	Having made an 'underlayer' of ghee (in the offering-spoon), he says, while making the cuttings from the cake , 'Recite (the invitatory prayer) to Varuna!' Here now some make two cuttings from the Soma-husks, but let him not do so; for that (heap of husks) is an empty body, unfit for offering. He makes two cuttings (from the cake) and bastes them once with ghee, and anoints (replenishes the places whence) the cuttings (have been made). Having called for the Sraushat, he says, 'Recite theoffering prayer to Varuna!' and offers as the Vashat is uttered.
4	5	17	Then, having made an underlayer of ghee, he says, while putting the (remainder of the) cake (into the spoon), 'Recite the invitatory prayer to Agni and Varuna!' This is for (Agni) Svishtakrit ; and as to why he does not say 'To Agni,' it is lest Varuna might seize upon Agni. If before he has cut twice from the Soma-husks, he now does so once, but if (he did) not, he need not heed it. He then bastes it twice with butter on the upper side; and having called for the Sraushat, he says, 'Recite the offering prayer to Agni and Varuna!' and offers as the Vashat is uttered.
4	5	18	Now these are six oblations; for there are six seasons in the year, and Varuna is the year: hence there are six oblations.
4	5	19	This is the course of the Âdityas ; and these Yagus, they say, belong to the Âdityas. Let (the Adhvaryu) endeavour to perform as much of it as is his (the sacrificer's) wish. And if the sacrificer tell him to do otherwise, then he should do otherwise. He may also perform those same four fore-offerings,--omitting that to the Barhis--two butter-portions, (the oblations of cake) to Varuna and Agni-Varuna, and two after-offerings,--omitting the one to the Barhis;--this makes ten. Now the virâg consistsof ten syllables, and the sacrifice is virâg: thus he makes the sacrifice to be like the virâg.
4	5	20	This is the course of the Aṅgiras. Having performed the offerings either way, (the Adhvaryu) makes the pot, in which the husks are, float with , 'In the ocean, in the waters, is thy heart (O Soma)'--for the ocean is the waters, and water is sap: that sap he now puts into him (Soma), and thus he unites him with that sap, and produces him therefrom; and he (Soma), even when produced, produces him (the sacrificer);--'May the plants and the waters unite with thee!'--thereby he puts two kinds of sap into him, that which is in plants, and that which is in water,--'that we may serve thee, O lord of the sacrifice, in the singing of praises and the utterance of worship , with Svâhâ!' Whatever is good in the sacrifice, that he thereby puts into him.
4	5	21	Thereupon, letting it go, he stands by it with , 'Ye divine waters, this is your child,'--for he (Soma) indeed is the child of the waters,--'bear ye him, well-beloved, well-nourished!' he thereby makes him over to the waters for protection--'This, O divine Soma, is thine abode: thrive thou well therein, and thrive thou  thoroughly!' whereby he means to say, 'Be thou therein for our happiness, and shield us from all inflictions!'
4	5	22	He then immerses it with , 'O laving bath, laving thou glidest along: with the help of the gods may I wipe out the sin committed against the gods; and with the help of the mortals that committed against mortals!'--for the sin committed against the gods he has indeed wiped out with the help of the gods, namely, with the help of king Soma; and the sin committed against mortals he has wiped out with the help of mortals, namely, by means of the animal victim and the sacrificial cake--'Preserve me, O god, from injury from the fiercely-howling (demon)!' whereby he means to say, 'Preserve me from all inflictions!'
4	5	23	Thereupon both (the sacrificer and his wife) having descended, bathe, and wash each other's back. Having wrapped themselves in fresh garments  they step out: even as a snake casts its skin, so does he cast away all his sin,--there is not in him even as much sin as there is in a toothless child. By the same way by which they came out (from the sacrificial ground), they return thither ; and, having returned, he puts a kindling-stick on the Âhavanîya (at the front hall-door) with, 'Thou art the kindler of the gods!' He thereby kindles the sacrificer himself,for along with the kindling of the gods the sacrificer is kindled .
5	1	1	He proceeds with the rice-pap to Aditi, as the concluding oblation. The reason why there is a rice-pap for Aditi is this. Because, on that former occasion , the gods said to her, 'Thine forsooth shall be the opening, and thine the concluding oblation,' therefore he prepares that share for her at both ends (of the Soma-sacrifice).
5	1	2	And because, on that occasion, he offers when about to go forth (upa-pra-i) to buy the king (Soma), therefore that (opening oblation) is called Prâyanîya. And because he now offers after coming out (ud-â-i) from the expiatory bath, therefore this (concluding oblation) is called Udayanîya . For this indeed is one and the same oblation: to Aditi belongs the opening, to Aditi the concluding (oblation); for Aditi is this (earth).
5	1	3	To Pathyâ Svasti he offers first (at the opening sacrifice): then the gods, through speech, saw their way in what was unknown to them, for by speech the confused becomes known. But now that it is known, he performs in the proper order.
5	1	4	To Agni he offers first, then to Soma, then to Savitri, then to Pathyâ Svasti, then to Aditi, Now Pathyâ Svasti (the wishing of a 'happy journey')is speech, and Aditi is this (earth): on her the gods thereby established speech, and thus established thereon speech speaks here.
5	1	5	Thereupon he slaughters a barren anûbandhyâ  cow for Mitra and Varuna. And this indeed is performed as a different sacrifice, and that an animal offering; for the Samishtayagus form the end of the sacrifice.
5	1	6	The reason why there is a barren cow for Mitra and Varuna is this. Whatever part of his (sacrifice)  who has offered is well-offered that part of his Mitra takes, and whatever is ill-offered that Varuna takes.
5	1	7	Then they say, 'What has become of the sacrificer?'--whatever well-offered part of his (sacrifice) Mitra here takes, that he now again surrenders to him, being pleased with this (cow); and whatever ill-offered part of his Varuna takes, that indeed he makes well-offered for him, being pleased with this (cow), and surrenders it again to him. This forsooth is his own sacrifice , his own merit.
5	1	8	And again, why there is a barren cow for Mitra and Varuna. Now, when the gods caused the cast seed to spring,--there is that sastra called Âgnimâruta : in connection therewith it is explained howthe gods caused that seed to spring. From it the coals (aṅgâra) sprung, and from the coals the Aṅgiras; and after that the other animals .
5	1	9	Then the dust of the ashes which remained: therefrom the ass was produced,--hence when it is dusty anywhere, people say, 'A very place for asses, forsooth !' And when no sap whatever remained,--thence was produced that barren cow belonging to Mitra and Varuna; wherefore that (cow) does not bring forth, for from sap seed is produced, and from seed cattle. And because she was produced at the end, therefore she comes after the end of the sacrifice. Hence also a barren cow for Mitra and Varuna is the most proper here: if he cannot obtain a barren cow, it may also be a bullock .
5	1	10	Then the Visve Devâh applied themselves  a second time: thence the Vaisvadevî (cow) was produced; then the Bârhaspatyâ: that is the end, for Brihaspati is the end.
5	1	11	And whosoever gives a thousand or more (cows to the priests), he will slaughter all these;--indeed, everything is obtained, everything conquered by him who gives a thousand or more. Those (three) cows are everything, (when offered) thus in the proper order: first one to Mitra and Varuna, then one to the All-gods, then one to Brihaspati.
5	1	12	And those who perform a long sacrificial session, for a year or more, they will slaughter all these ;--indeed everything is obtained, everything conquered by those who perform a long sacrificial session, for a year or more: those (cows) are everything, (when offered) thus in the proper order.
5	1	13	Thereupon he performs the Udavasânîyâ ishti (completing oblation). He prepares a cake on five potsherds for Agni. Its invitatory and offering prayers are five-footed paṅktis . For at this time the sacrifice of him who has sacrificed is, as it were, exhausted in strength: it, as it were, passes away from him. Now all sacrifices are Agni, since all sacrifices are performed in him, the domestic sacrifices as well as others. He thus takes hold again of the sacrifice, and thus that sacrifice of his isnot exhausted in strength, and does not pass away from him.
5	1	14	The reason why the cake is one on five potsherds, and the invitatory and offering prayers are paṅktis (verses of five feet), is that the sacrifice is fivefold. He thus takes hold again of the sacrifice, and thus that sacrifice of his is not exhausted in strength, and does not pass away from him.
5	1	15	The priests’ fee for it is gold; for this is a sacrifice to Agni, and gold is Agni's seed: therefore the priests’ fee is gold. Or an ox, for such a one is of Agni's nature as regards its shoulder, since its shoulder (bearing the yoke) is as if burnt by fire.
5	1	16	Or , he takes ghee in five ladlings, and offers it with the verse to Vishnu , 'Stride thou widely, O Vishnu, make wide room for our abode! drink the ghee, thou born of ghee, and speed the lord of the sacrifice ever onwards, Hail!' For Vishnu is the sacrifice: he thus takes hold again of the sacrifice, and thus his sacrifice is not exhausted in strength, and does not pass away from him. And let him on this occasion give as much as he can afford, for no offering, they say, should be without a Dakshinâ. When this Udavasânîyâ-ishti is completed, he offers the (ordinary) evening (milk) offering ,--but the morning offering at its proper time.
5	2	1	They lay hands on the barren cow , and having laid hands on it, they quiet it. It having been quieted , he says (to the slaughterer), 'Pull out the omentum!' The omentum having been pulled out , let him tell (the slaughterer) to search groping for an embryo. If they do not find one, why need they care? and if they find one, atonement is made therefore.
5	2	2	For surely it is not right that, thinking it to be one (cow), they should perform, as it were, with that one; or that, thinking them to be two, they should perform, as it were, with two . Let him bid (theslaughterer) get ready the pot (sthâlî) and the cloth (ushnîsha) .
5	2	3	They then perform with the omentum, just as its mode of performance is . Having performed with the omentum, both the Adhvaryu and Sacrificer return (to the sacrificial ground). The Adhvaryu says, 'Pull out that embryo!' otherwise he would not pull it out from the womb, since it is only pulled out from the womb of a sick or dead (female); but when the embryo is full grown, then indeed it comes out through birth: let him bid him pull it out even after tearing asunder the thighs.
5	2	4	When it is pulled out, he addresses it with , 'May the embryo of ten months move together with the caul!'--by saying, 'May it move,' he puts breath into it; and 'of ten months' he says, because when an embryo is full grown, then it is one of ten months: thus, even though it is not ten months old, he makes it one of ten months by means of the Brahman (prayer), the Yagus.
5	2	5	'Together with the caul'--this he says so that, like a ten months’ (calf), it may go out with the caul ,--'As yonder wind moveth, as the ocean moveth;'--thereby he puts breath into it;--'So hath this ten months' (calf) slipped out with the caul;'--this he means to say so that, like a ten months’ calf, it may slip out with the caul.
5	2	6	Here now they say, 'What is he to do withthat embryo?'--They might cut off a portion from every limb, even as (is done) the portioning of other portions. But let him not do so; for that (embryo) surely has its limbs undeveloped. Having cut it below the neck, they should let that fat juice drip into the pot; for that same juice drips from all its limbs, and thus it is a portion cut out from all its limbs. He then cuts the sacrificial portions of the cow in the same way in which they are (usually) portioned off.
5	2	7	They cook them on the cooking-fire of the animal offering: at the same time  they cook that fat juice. Having wrapped the embryo in the cloth, he lays it down by the side of the cooking-fire. When it (the victim) is cooked, he puts together  the (flesh) portions and bastes only them, but not that juice. They remove the victim (from the fire); and at the same time they remove that juice.
5	2	8	They take it along the back of the pit, between the sacrificial stake and the fire. It having been put down south (of the fire), the Pratiprasthâtri cuts off the sacrificial portions. He then makes an under-layer (of ghee) in both offering-spoons, and addresses (the Hotri) for the recitation to the Manotâ deity on the havis. Thereupon they make cuttings from the portions of the cow, in the same way in which cuttings are made from them .
5	2	9	Now there is an offering-spoon called prakaranîtherein the Pratiprasthâtri makes an underlayer of ghee for the fat juice, takes two portions (from the juice), bastes them once (with ghee), and replenishes (the juice whence) both portions (have been taken). He (the Adhvaryu) then addresses (the Hotri) for. the recitation (of the invitatory prayer). Having called for the Sraushat, he says (to the Maitrâvaruna), 'Prompt (the Hotri to recite the offering prayer)!' As the Vashat is uttered, the Adhvaryu offers (the flesh portions). After the Adhvaryu's oblation the Pratiprasthâtri offers (the fat juice)--
5	2	10	With , 'Thou whose fruit is fit for sacrifice,'--for embryos are unfit for sacrifice: this one he thus makes fit for sacrifice by means of the Brahman, the Yagus;--'thou who hast a golden womb,'--for on that former occasion , they rend the womb when they tear out (the embryo); and gold means immortal life; he thus makes that womb of her (the cow) immortal;--'Him whose limbs are unbroken, I have brought together with his mother, Hail!' Thus, if it be a male (embryo); but if it be a female one, with, 'Her whose limbs are unbroken, I have brought together with her mother, Hail!' And, if it be an indistinguishable embryo, let him offer in making it male, since embryos (garbha, masc.) are male, 'Him whose limbs are unbroken, I have brought together with his mother, Hail!' For on that former occasion, when they tear out (the embryo) they separate it from its mother: now, having rendered it successful by means of the Brahman, the Yagus, he brings it again together with its mother in the midst of the sacrifice.
5	2	11	Thereupon the Adhvaryu makes the oblation to the Lord of the forest . Having made the oblation to the Lord of the forest, the Adhvaryu, while pouring together the sacrificial portions that are for the upabhrit, says (to the Hotri), 'Recite the invitatory prayer to Agni Svishtakrit!' The Pratiprasthâtri comes and takes all that fat juice, and pours twice (ghee) thereon. Having called for the Sraushat, the Adhvaryu says, 'Prompt!' and offers as the Vashat is uttered. After the Adhvaryu's oblation the Pratiprasthâtri offers,
5	2	12	With , 'The bountiful multiform juice ,'--by 'bountiful' he means to say (the bestower) 'of numerous gifts;' and 'the multiform' he says, because embryos are, as it were, multiform,--'The strong juice hath invested itself with greatness:'--for it (the embryo) is indeed invested  in the mother.--'May the worlds spread along her, the one-footed, two-footed, three-footed, four-footed, eight-footed,--'Hail!' He thereby magnifies her (the cow): far more, forsooth, does he gain by offering an eight-footed one, than by one not eight-footed.
5	2	13	Here now they say, 'What is he to do with that embryo ?' They may expose it on a tree; forembryos have the air for their support, and the tree is, as it were, the same as the air: thus he establishes it on its own support. But, say they, if, in that case, any one were to curse him, saying, 'They shall expose him  dead on a tree,' then verily it would be so.
5	2	14	They may throw it into the water, for water is the support of everything here: he thus establishes it in the water. But, say they, if, in that case, any one were to curse him, saying, 'He shall die in water!' then verily it would be so.
5	2	15	They may bury it ins a mole-hill; for this (earth) is the support of everything here: he thus establishes it on this same (earth). But, say they, if, in that case, any one were to curse him, saying, 'They shall quickly prepare a burying-place for him, being dead!' then verily it would be so.
5	2	16	He may offer it to the Maruts on the cooking-fire of the animal sacrifice; for the Maruts, the clans (common people) of the gods, are not oblation-eaters (ahuta-ad) , and the uncooked embryo, as it were, is no oblation (ahuta); and the animal cooking-fire is taken from the Âhavanîya: thus indeed it (the embryo) isnot excluded from the sacrifice, and yet is not (offered) directly in the Âhavanîya (offering-fire). And the Maruts are of the gods: he thus establishes it with the Maruts .
5	2	17	As soon as he has performed the Samishtayagus offerings, when the coals are only just extinguished, he takes that embryo with the cloth, and standing with his face to the east, he offers it with a verse to the Maruts ,--'Verily, O Maruts, in whosesoever house ye drink, the heroes of the sky, he is the best protected man.' He utters no Svâhâ (hail), for the Maruts, the clans of the gods are no oblation-eaters, and no oblation, as it were, is what is offered without Svâhâ. And the Maruts are of the gods: he thus establishes it with the Maruts.
5	2	18	He then covers it over with the coals with , 'The great Heaven and Earth may mix this our sacrifice, and fill us with nourishments!'
5	3	1	The Shodasin  (graha) forsooth is Indra. Now, at one time the beings surpassed (ati-rik) Indra--the beings being the creatures--they were in a state of equality, as it were, with him.
5	3	2	Indra then bethought himself, 'How can I stand forth over everything here, and how may everything here be beneath me?' He saw that graha, and drew it for himself. Then he stood forth over everything here, and everything here wasbeneath him. And, verily, for whomsoever, knowing this, they draw that cup of Soma, he stands forth over everything here, and everything here is beneath him.
5	3	3	Wherefore it has been said by the Rishi , 'The sky hath not reached thy greatness, when thou didst rest on the earth with thine other thigh,'--for, verily, yonder sky did not reach up to his other thigh : so did he stand forth over everything here, and everything here was beneath him. And, verily, for whomsoever, knowing this, they draw that cup of Soma, he stands forth over everything here, and everything here is beneath him.
5	3	4	He draws it with a verse to the lord of the bay steeds (Indra Harivant); they (the Udgâtris) chant verses to (Indra) Harivant, and he (the Hotri) afterwards recites verses to (Indra) Harivant. For Indra seized upon the strength, the fury (haras) of his enemies, the Asuras; and in like manner does he (the sacrificer) now seize upon the strength, the fury of his enemies: therefore he draws the graha with a verse to (Indra) Harivant; they chant verses to Harivant, and he (the Hotri) afterwards recites verses to Harivant.
5	3	5	He draws it with an Anushtubh verse; for the morning press-feast belongs to the Gâyatrî, the midday feast to the Trishtubh, and the evening feast to the Gagatî. The Anushtubh, then, is over and above  (ati-rikta), and he thus makes that (Soma of the Shodasin) to remain over: hence he takes it with an Anushtubh.
5	3	6	He draws it in a square cup; for there are three worlds: these same worlds he gains by three corners, and by the fourth corner he makes that (Soma) to remain over;--therefore he draws it in a square cup.
5	3	7	Let him draw it at the morning pressing, after drawing the Âgrayana. Having been drawn at the morning pressing, it reposes apart from that time: he thus makes it to outlast all (three) pressings.
5	3	8	Or he may draw it at the midday pressing, after drawing the Âgrayana,--but this is mere speculation: let him rather draw it at the morning pressing, after drawing the Âgrayana: having been drawn at the morning pressing, it reposes apart from that time.
5	3	9	He thus draws it therefrom with , 'Mount the chariot, O slayer of Vritra, thy bay steeds have been harnessed by prayer! May the stone by its sound draw hitherward thy mind!--Thou art taken with a support: thee to Indra Shodasin (the sixteenfold)!--This is thy womb: thee to Indra Shodasin!'
5	3	10	Or with this , 'Harness thy long-maned, girth-filling bay steeds! Come hither to us, O Indra, drinker of Soma, to hear our songs! Thou art taken with a support: thee to Indra Shodasin!--This is thy womb: thee to Indra Shodasin!'
5	3	11	Thereupon he returns (to the sadas) and bespeaks the chant with, 'Soma has been left over: Turn ye back !' for he indeed causes it to remain over by that (Shodasin graha). He (the Adhvaryu) bespeaks it  before the setting of the sun; and after sunset he (the Hotri) follows it up by reciting the sastra: thus he thereby joins day and night together,--therefore he bespeaks (the stotra)  before thesetting of the sun, and after sunset he follows it up by reciting the sastra .
5	4	1	Now, at first the gods were all alike, all good. Of them, being all alike, all good, three desired, 'May we be superior !'--Agni, Indra, and Sûrya.
5	4	2	They went on praising and toiling. They saw those Atigrâhyas , and drew (grah) them for themselvesover and above (ati): hence the name Atigrâhyas. They became superior, even as they are now superior  and verily he becomes superior for whomsoever, knowing this, they draw those cups of Soma.
5	4	3	And at first there was not in Agni that lustre which is now in him. He desired, 'May that lustre be in me!' He saw this graha, and drew it for himself, and henceforth that lustre was in him.
5	4	4	And at first there was not in Indra that power which is now in him. He desired, 'May that power be in me!' He saw this graha and drew it for himself, and henceforth that power was in him.
5	4	5	And at first there was not in Sûrya that splendour which is now in him. He desired, 'May that splendour be in me!' He saw this graha and drew it for himself, and henceforth that splendour was in him. And verily for whomsoever, knowing this, they draw those cups of Soma, he takes unto himself those same fires (energies), those same powers.
5	4	6	Let him draw them at the morning pressing, after drawing the Âgrayana; for the Âgrayana is the self (body), and many parts of this self are one each (and thus) over and above (the others), such as the lung  and heart, and others.
5	4	7	Or he might draw them from the Pûtabhrit, at the midday pressing, after drawing the Ukthya, or when about to bespeak (the chant), for the Ukthya indeed is the same as that undefined self of his. But this is mere speculation: let him rather draw them at the morning pressing, after drawing the Âgrayana.
5	4	8	They are offered after the offering of the Mâhendra graha; for that, the Mâhendra, is Indra's special cup; and so are the (Nishkevalya) stotra and sastra specially his. But the sacrificer is Indra; and for the sacrificer's benefit (these cups) are drawn: therefore they are offered after the offering of the Mâhendra graha.
5	4	9	He thus draws them therefrom  Vâg. S. VIII,
5	4	38	; Rig-veda IX,
5	4	66	,
5	4	21	] , 'O Agni, skilful in works, become thou pure, bestowing upon us lustre and manly vigour, and upon me health and wealth!--Thou art taken with a support: thee to Agni, for lustre!--This is thy womb: thee to Agni, for lustre!'
5	4	10	, 'Uprising by thy power didst thou move thy jaws, O Indra, drinking the cup-drawn juice!--Thou art taken with a support: thee to Indra for power!--This is thy womb: thee to Indra for power!'
5	4	11	, 'His beacons have appeared, his beams, wide and far over the people, shining splendidly like fires!--Thou art taken with a support: thee to Sûrya for splendour!--This is thy womb: thee to Sûrya for splendour!'
5	4	12	The drinking of these (cups is performed by the sacrificers with the resp. texts), 'O lustrous Agni, lustrous art thou among the gods: may I be lustrous among men!--Most powerful Indra, most powerful art thou among the gods: may I be the most powerful among men!--Most splendid Sûrya, most splendid art thou among the gods: may I be the most splendid among men!' And, verily, these same splendours, these same powers he takes unto himself for whomsoever, knowing this, they draw these cups.
5	4	13	Let him draw them on the first three days of the Prishthya shadaha ; namely, the Agni cup onthe first day, the Indra cup on the second, the Sûrya cup on the third--thus one day by day.
5	4	14	Some , however, draw them on the last three days; but let him not do so: let him rather draw them on the first three days. But should he intend to draw them on the last three days, let him first draw them on the first three days and let him then draw them on the last three days. In like manner they are drawn (all three) in their proper order, on one and the same day, at the Visvagit  with all the Prishthas.
5	5	1	Pragâpati, forsooth, is that sacrifice which is performed here, and from which these creatures have been produced: and in like manner are they produced thereafter even to this day.
5	5	2	After the Upâmsu cup goats are produced. Now that (cup) is again employed in the sacrifice: hence creatures are here produced again and again.
5	5	3	After the Antâryama cup sheep are produced. Now that (cup) is again employed at the sacrifice: hence creatures are here produced again and again.
5	5	4	And because of those two (cups) which are together he offers the Upâmsu first, therefore, of goats and sheep when they are together , the goats go first, and the sheep behind them.
5	5	5	And because, having offered the Upâmsu, he wipes (the vessel) upwards, therefore these goats walk like nimbly  climbing spokes.
5	5	6	And because, having offered the Antaryâma, he wipes (the vessel) downwards, therefore these sheep walk with their heads down, as if digging. Now they, the goats and sheep, are most conspicuously Pragâpati-like: whence, bringing forth thrice in the year, they produce two or three  (young ones).
5	5	7	After  the Sukra cup men are produced. Now that (cup) is again employed at the sacrifice: hence creatures are here produced again and again. But the Sukra (bright) is the same as he that burns yonder, and he indeed is Indra; and of animals, man is Indra-like : whence he rules over animals.
5	5	8	After the Ritu cup the one-hoofed species is produced. Now that (cup) is again employed in the sacrifice: hence creatures are here produced again and again. And such-like is the Ritu cup , and suchlike the head of the one-hoofed. The Âgrayanacup, the Ukthya cup, and the Âditya cup,--after them cows are produced. Now, these are again employed in the sacrifice: hence creatures are here produced again and again.
5	5	9	And because goats are produced after the fewest cups, therefore, though bringing forth thrice in a year, producing two or three, (they are) very few, for they are produced after the fewest cups.
5	5	10	And because cows are produced after the most cups, therefore, though bringing forth once in a year, and producing one each time, (they are) most numerous, for they are produced after the most cups.
5	5	11	Then, in the Dronakalasa (trough) he finally draws the Hâriyogana graha. Now, the Dronakalasa is Pragâpati;--he turns unto these creatures, and fosters them, and kisses them : he fosters them in that he produces them.
5	5	12	Now, these same cups after which creatures are produced, are five,--those of the Upâmsu and Antaryâma (counting as) one and the same, the Sukra cup, the Ritu cup, the Âgrayana cup, and the Ukthya cup; for there are five seasons in the year, and Pragâpati is the year, and the sacrifice is Pragâpati. But if there be six seasons in the year, then the Âditya cup is the sixth of them.
5	5	13	But indeed there is only that one cup after which creatures are produced here, to wit, the Upâmsu cup; for the Upâmsu is breath, and Pragâpati is breath, and everything here is after Pragâpati.
5	6	1	Pragâpati, forsooth, is that sacrifice which is here performed, and whence these creatures have been produced, and in like manner are they produced therefrom even to this day. Having drawn the Asvina graha, he makes (the sacrificer) eye (the several cups, while muttering) the Avakâsa formulas .
5	6	2	The Upâmsu cup he eyes first with , 'For mine out-breathing, (a) giver of lustre , become thou pure for lustre!' Then the Upâmsusavana stone with, 'For my through-breathing, giver of lustre, become thou pure for lustre!' Then the Antaryâma cup with, 'For mine up-breathing, giver of lustre, become thou pure for lustre!' Then the Aindravâyava with, 'For my voice, giver of lustre, become thou pure for lustre!' Then the Maitrâvaruna with, 'For mine intelligence and will, giver of lustre, become thou pure for lustre!' Then the Asvina with, 'For mine ear, giver of lustre, become thou pure for lustre!' Then the Sukra and Manthin with, 'For mine eyes, givers of lustre, become ye pure for lustre!'
5	6	3	Then the Âgrayana with , 'For my mind, giver of lustre, become thou -pure for lustre!' Then the Ukthya with, 'Formy vigour, giver of lustre, become thou pure for lustre!' Then the Dhruva with, 'For my life, giver of lustre, become thou pure for lustre!' Then the two Soma-troughs (Pûtabhrit and Âdhavanîya) with, 'For all mine offspring, givers of lustre, become ye pure for lustre!' Now the two troughs belong to the All-gods, for therefrom they draw (Soma) for the gods, therefrom for men, therefrom for the Fathers: therefore the two Soma-troughs belong to the All-gods.
5	6	4	Then the Dronakalasa with , 'Who (ka) art thou? Which one art thou?'--Ka is Pragâpati;--'Whose (kasya, or Ka's) art thou? who (ka) art thou by name?'--Ka ('who') by name is Pragâpati;--'Thou upon whose name we have thought,' for he indeed thinks upon his name;--'Thou whom we have gladdened with Soma;'--for he indeed gladdens him with Soma. Having drawn the Âsvina cup, he prays for blessing part after part (of the sacrifice) with, 'May I be abundantly supplied with offspring,' thereby he prays for offspring;--'abundantly supplied with men,' thereby he prays for men (heroes);--'abundantly supplied with food!' thereby he prays for prosperity.
5	6	5	He must not let every one eye them, but only him who is well known, or one who is his friend, or one who, being learned in sacred lore, may acquire these (texts) through study. Having drawn the Âsvina cup, he (thus) produces the whole sacrifice; and having produced the whole sacrifice, he deposits it in his own self, and makes it his own.
5	7	1	Now, there are here thirty-four utterances, called expiations . Pragâpati, forsooth, is that sacrifice which is performed here, and from which these creatures have been produced,--and in like manner are they produced therefrom even to this day.
5	7	2	There are eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, twelve Âdityas; and these two, Heaven and Earth, are the (thirty-second and) thirty-third. And there are thirty-three gods, and Pragâpati is the thirty-fourth;--thus he makes him (the sacrificer, or Yagña) to be Pragâpati : now that  is, for that is immortal, and what is immortal that is. But what is mortal that also is Pragâpati; for Pragâpati is everything: thus he makes him to be Pragâpati, and hence there are these thirty-four utterances, called expiations.
5	7	3	Now some call these (formulas) the 'forms of the sacrifice;' but, indeed, they are rather the joints of the sacrifice: this same sacrifice, in being performed, is continually becoming those deities.
5	7	4	Now should the cow, which supplies the gharma , fail (to give milk), let them go to another; and at the same place where they otherwise make that gharma (milk) flow , let them place her with herhead towards the north, or in front of the hall with her face to the east.
5	7	5	And that which is the right one of the two bones with hair-tufts which protrude on both sides of her tail-bone,--thereon he offers those thirty-four oblations of ghee; for as much as are those thirty-four utterances, so much is the sacrifice: thus he lays the whole sacrifice entirely into her; for therefrom she lets the gharma (milk) flow, and this is the atonement therefore.
5	7	6	And if any part of the sacrifice were to fail, let him make an oblation with regard thereto on the Âhavanîya during the consecration and the Upasads, and on the Âgnîdhra during the Soma feast--for whatever point of the sacrifice fails, that breaks--and whichever then is the deity in that (special offering), through that one he heals it, through that he puts it together again.
5	7	7	And if anything  be spilt, let him pour water thereon--everything here being pervaded (or obtained) by water--for the obtainment of everything ; with a verse to Vishnu and Varuna,--for whatsoever distress one undergoes here on earth, all that Varuna inflicts ,--, 'They by whose vigour the spheres were propped up, who are in strength the strongest and mightiest; who sway with powers unresisted, to Vishnu and Varuna hath it gone at the morning prayer!' For Vishnu is the sacrifice, and it is that (sacrifice) of his which now undergoes distress; and Varuna is the inflicter: thus by both these deities--that whose (sacrifice) undergoes distress, and that which inflicts it--he heals (the joint of the sacrifice), by both he puts it together.
5	7	8	And let him then touch (the spilt material) with , 'To the gods, to the sky hath the sacrifice gone: may wealth thence accrue to me! to the men, to the air hath the sacrifice gone: may wealth thence accrue to me! to the Fathers, to the earth hath the sacrifice gone: may wealth thence accrue to me!'--'To whatever world the sacrifice has gone, thence happiness has come to me !' this is what he thereby means to say.
5	7	9	Here now Âruni said, 'Why should he sacrifice who would think himself the worse for a miscarriage of the sacrifice? I, for one, am the better for a miscarriage of the sacrifice !' This, then, he said with reference to the adoption of those benedictions.
5	8	1	Now when at that Trirâtra  sacrifice he gives those thousand (cows), then that one is made the one-thousandth . On the first day he brings three hundred and thirty-three; and likewise on the second day he brings three hundred and thirty-three; and likewise on the third day he brings three hundred and thirty-three. Then that one-thousandth is left over.
5	8	2	She should be three-coloured, they say, for that is the most perfect form for her. But let it be a red one, and spotted, for that indeed is the most perfect form for her.
5	8	3	Let it be one that has not been approached (by a bull), for she, the Sâhasrî, is in reality Vâk (speech); but Vâk, forsooth, is of unimpaired vigour, and so is one of unimpaired vigour which has not been approached: therefore it should be one that has not been approached.
5	8	4	He may lead her up (to the sacrificial ground) on the first day; for she, the Sâhasrî, is in reality Vâk, and hers, Vâk's, is that thousandfold progeny . She walks at the head , and behind her follows her progeny. Or he may lead her up on the last day; then her progeny precedes her, and she herself walks behind. This, however, is mere speculation: let him lead her up on the last day,--her progeny precedes her, and she herself walks behind.
5	8	5	North of the Havirdhâna shed, and south of the Âgnîdhra fire-house he makes her smell the Dronakalasa; for the Dronakalasa is the sacrifice; thus he makes her see the sacrifice.
5	8	6	With , 'Smell the trough: may the drops enter thee, O mighty one!' Now he who gives a thousand (cows) becomes, as it were, emptied: him, thus emptied, he thereby replenishes, when he says, 'Smell the trough: may the drops enter thee, O mighty one!'
5	8	7	'Return again with sap!' him who is emptied he thus replenishes when he says, 'Return again with sap!'
5	8	8	'And milk to us a thousandfold!' him who is emptied he thus replenishes with a thousand (forces), when he says, 'And milk to us a thousandfold!'
5	8	9	'Broad-streamed, milk-abounding,--may wealth come back to me!' him who is emptied he thus replenishes when he says, 'May wealth come back to me!'
5	8	10	He then mutters in her right ear, 'O Idâ, blithesome, adorable, lovable, bright, shining, Aditi (inviolable), Sarasvatî (sapful), mighty,glorious,--these are thy names, O cow: tell thou the gods of me as a doer of good!'--or, 'speak thou . . .' These indeed are her names with the gods: he thus means to say, 'whatever thy names are with the gods, therewith tell the gods of me as a doer of good.'
5	8	11	They release her. If, not urged by any man, she goes eastwards, then let him know that this sacrificer has succeeded, that he has won the happy world. If she goes northwards, let him know that the sacrificer will be more glorious in this world. If she goes westwards, let him know that he will be rich in dependants and crops. If she goes southwards, let him know that the sacrificer will quickly depart from this world. Such are the ways of knowledge.
5	8	12	And what three (cows) there are each time over and above the (three hundred and) thirty, thereto they add that one . Now, when they draw out a Virâg (verse), they pull it asunder, and a Virâg which is pulled asunder is torn in two;--and the Virâg consisting of ten syllables, he thus makes the Virâg complete. Let him give her to the Hotri; for the Hotri is a thousandfold : therefore let him give her to the Hotri.
5	8	13	Or let him appoint two Unnetris, and let him give her to him, of the two, who does not call for the Sraushat; for defective, indeed, is he who, being an officiating priest, does not call for the Sraushat; and defective also is the Virâg which is pulled asunder: thus he puts the defective to the defective.
5	8	14	Now they say, one ought not to give anything above a thousand (cows), because by a thousand he obtains all the objects of his desire. But Âsuri said, 'Let him give according to his wish: by a thousand he indeed obtains all his wishes; and anything else (that he gives) is likewise given at his wish .'
5	8	15	And should he intend to give a cart yoked (with a team of oxen), or something else, let him give it either after the offering of the omentum of the barren cow, or at the concluding (udavasânîyâ) offering.
5	8	16	In bringing the dakshinâs, let him bring complete decads. If he intends to give one (cow) to any (priest), let him pass over a decad to ten such (priests). If he intends to give two to any one, let him pass over a decad to five such (priests). If he intends to give three to any one, let him pass over a decad to three such . If he intends to give five toany one, let him pass over a decad to two such. Thus up to a hundred: and thus this perfect Virâg of his becomes a cow of plenty for him in yonder world.
5	9	1	When he performs a twelve days’ sacrifice with transposed metres (Dvâdasâha vyûdhakhandas), then he (the Adhvaryu) transposes the grahas (cups of Soma); and both the Udgâtri and the Hotri transpose the metres. Now there is first that normal Tryaha (triduum), with settled metres : there he draws the cup beginning with the Aindravâyava.
5	9	2	Then, on the fourth day, he transposes the grahas, and they transpose the metres. There he draws the cups beginning with the Âgrayana,--for that fourth day is Pragâpati's own; and the Âgrayana is the self, and Pragâpati is the self: therefore he draws the cups beginning with the Âgrayana.
5	9	3	Having drawn that (Âgrayana) cup, he does not deposit it--the grahas being the vital airs--lest he should disorder the vital airs ; for he would indeed disorder the vital airs, were he to deposit it. They sit near holding that (cup) ; and (the Adhvaryu) draws (the other) cups; and while he draws the cups, then whenever the time of that cup (in the order of performance comes), he utters 'Him' and deposits it. Then follows that normal  fifth day; on that he draws the cups beginning with the Aindravâyava.
5	9	4	Thereupon, on the sixth day, he transposes the grahas, and they transpose the metres. There he draws the cups beginning with the Sukra; for that sixth day is Indra's own, and the Sukra (bright, clear) is he that burns yonder, and he (the sun) indeed is Indra: therefore he draws the cups beginning with the Sukra.
5	9	5	Having drawn that (cup), he does not deposit it--the grahas being the vital airs--lest he should disorder the vital airs; for he would indeed disorder the vital airs, were he to deposit it. They sit nearholding that (cup); and he draws (the other) cups; and while he draws the cups, then whenever the time of that (cup comes), he deposits it.
5	9	6	Then, on the seventh day, he transposes the grahas, and they transpose the metres. There he draws the cups beginning with the Sukra cup; for that seventh day belongs to the Brihatî ('great' metre); for the Sukra is he that burns yonder, and he indeed is great: therefore he draws the cups beginning with the Sukra.
5	9	7	Having drawn that (cup), he does not deposit it--the grahas being the vital airs--lest he should disorder the vital airs; for he would indeed disorder the vital airs, were he to deposit it. They sit near holding that (cup); and he draws the (other) cups; and while he draws the cups, then whenever the time of that (cup comes), he deposits it. Then follows that normal eighth day: there he draws the cups beginning with the Aindravâyava.
5	9	8	Then, on the ninth day, he transposes the grahas, and they transpose the metres. There he draws the cups beginning with the Âgrayana; for that ninth day belongs to the Gagatî (metre), and the Âgrayana is the self, and the self (soul) is this whole world (gagat): therefore he draws the cups beginning with the Âgrayana.
5	9	9	Having drawn it, he does not deposit it--the grahas being the vital airs--lest he should disorder the vital airs; for he would indeed disorder the vital airs, were he to deposit it. They sit near holding that (cup); and he draws the (other) cups; and while he draws the cups, when the time of that (cup comes), he utters 'Him' and deposits it.
5	9	10	Now they say, He should not transpose thecups--the cups being the vital airs--lest he should disorder the vital airs; for he would indeed disorder the vital airs, were he to transpose them: therefore he should not transpose (the cups).
5	9	11	But let him, nevertheless, transpose them; for the cups are the limbs, and in sleeping one likes to turn  his limbs from one side to the other: therefore let him nevertheless transpose them.
5	9	12	Nevertheless, he should not transpose them--the cups being the vital airs--lest he should disorder the vital airs; for he would indeed disorder the vital airs, were he to transpose (the cups): therefore let him not transpose them.
5	9	13	What, then, is the Adhvaryu to do in that case, when both the Udgâtri and Hotri transpose (change) the metres ? In that, at the morning pressing, he draws first the Aindravâyava cup; and at the midday pressing the Sukra cup; and at the evening pressing the Âgrayana cup,--thereby forsooth the Adhvaryu transposes (the cups).
5	10	1	If the Soma is carried off, let him say, 'Run about and seek!' If they find it, why should they care? But if they do not find it, atonement is made therefore.
5	10	2	Now there are two kinds of Phâlguna plants,the red-flowering and the brown-flowering. Those Phâlguna plants which have brown flowers one may press; for they, the brown-flowering Phâlgunas, are akin to the Soma-plant: therefore he may press those with brown flowers.
5	10	3	If they cannot get brown-flowering (Phâlgunas), he may press the Syenahrita  plant. For when Gâyatrî flew up for Soma, a sprig of Soma fell from her, as she was bringing him: it became the Syenahrita plant: therefore he may press the Syenahrita plant.
5	10	4	If they cannot get the Syenahrita, he may press Âdâra plants. For when the head of the sacrifice was cut off, then Âdâra plants sprung from the sap which spirted from it: therefore he may press Âdâra plants.
5	10	5	If they cannot get Âdâras, he may press brown Dûb (dûrvâ) plants, for they, the brown Dûb plants, are akin to the Soma: therefore he may press brown Dûb plants.
5	10	6	If they cannot get brown Dûb plants, he may also press any kind of yellow Kusa plants. In that case let him also give one cow; and, when he comes out of the purificatory bath, let him again become consecrated, for the atonement for that (use of plants other than Soma) is a second sacrifice. So much then as to those robbed of their Soma.
5	10	7	Now as to those who burst their Soma-trough (kalasa). If the trough bursts, let him say, 'Try to catch it!' If they catch a handful or a goupenful  (of Soma), let them perform, as far as is in their power ,after pouring (water) to it from other ekadhana pitchers. But if they do not catch any, let them perform, as far as is in their power, after pouring out some of the Âgrayana and pouring (water) thereto from other ekadhana pitchers. And if the trough bursts before the dakshinâ (cows) have been led up, let him then give one cow; and after coming out from the purificatory bath, let him be consecrated again; for the atonement for that (mishap) is a second sacrifice. So much then as to those who burst the trough.
5	10	8	Then as to those by whom any Soma is left over. If any (Soma) be left after the Agnishtoma, let him draw the Ukthya cup from the Pûtabhrit. If any be left after the Ukthya, let him undertake the Shodasin. If any be left after the Shodasin, let them undertake a night (performance) . If any be left after the night (performance), let them undertake a day (performance) . But nothing, surely, remains after that .
6	1	1	Now, the Amsu (graha), forsooth, is no other than Pragâpati: that (cup) is his (Yagña's or the Sacrificer's) self , for Pragâpati is the self. Hence when they draw that (cup) they produce that self of his. Therein they lay these vital airs, according to as these vital airs, the grahas, are explained ; and verily the sacrificer is born with his whole body in yonder world.
6	1	2	Where they draw that (cup), then that is (like) having a hold ; and where they do not draw it, then that is (like) having no hold: therefore, then, he draws the Amsu.
6	1	3	He draws it with a vessel of udumbara wood; for that (cup) is Pragâpati, and the udumbara tree is Pragâpati's own: therefore he draws it with a vessel of udumbara wood.
6	1	4	He draws it with a square vessel; for there are here three worlds: these three worlds he obtains by three (corners). And Pragâpati is the fourth over and above these three worlds: thus he obtains Pragâpati by the fourth (corner): therefore he draws it with a square vessel.
6	1	5	Silently he takes up the pressing-stone; silently he throws down the Soma-plants (amsu); silently he pours water thereon; silently raising (the stone), hepresses once; silently he offers that (libation) without drawing breath: thus he makes him (the sacrificer) to be Pragâpati.
6	1	6	Now there is a piece of gold in that (spoon): that he smells at. And if he either galls or scratches himself at this (sacrifice),--gold being immortal life,--he lays that immortal life into his own self.
6	1	7	As to this Râma Aupatasvini said, 'Let him freely breathe out and freely breathe in: if he but offers silently, thereby he makes him (the sacrificer) to be Pragâpati.'
6	1	8	Now there is a piece of gold in that (spoon): that he smells at. And if he either galls or scratches himself at this (sacrifice),--gold being immortal life, he lays that immortal life into his own self.
6	1	9	As to this Budila Âsvatarâsvi said, 'Let him draw it after merely raising (the stone), and let him not press; for they do press for other deities: thus he does different from what he does for other deities; and in that he raises (the stone) thereby indeed the pressing takes place for him.'
6	1	10	As to this Yâgñavalkya said, 'Nay, let him press: "The unpressed Soma delighted not the mighty Indra, nor the outpressed draughts without prayer," thus spake the Rishi . For no other deity does he strike but once: thus he does different from what he does for other deities,--therefore let him press!'
6	1	11	Twelve heifers pregnant with their first calf are the priests' fee for this (graha). Now there are twelve months in the year, and Pragâpati is the year, and the Amsu is Pragâpati: thus he makes him (the sacrificer) to be Pragâpati.
6	1	12	They have twelve embryo calves,--that makestwenty-four. Now there are twenty-four half-moons in the year, and Pragâpati is the year, and the Amsu is Pragâpati: thus he makes him to be Pragâpati.
6	1	13	Now Kaukûsta  indeed gave as many as twenty-four heifers with their first calf as dakshinâs, and a bull as the twenty-fifth, and gold; and truly that is what he gave.
6	1	14	This (graha) should not be drawn for every one, since this is his (Yagña's) self. It should only be drawn for one who is well known, or one who is his (the Adhvaryu's) friend, or one who, being learned in sacred lore, would acquire it by his study.
6	1	15	It should be drawn at a (sacrifice with) a thousand (cows as the priests’ fee); for a thousand is everything, and this (graha) is everything. It should be drawn at (a sacrifice) where the entire property is given away, for the entire property is everything, and this (graha) is everything. It should be drawn at a Visvagit with all the Prishthas, for the Visvagit ('all-conquering') is everything, and this (cup) is everything. It should be drawn at a Vâgapeya and Râgasûya, for that is everything. It should be drawn at a sattra (sacrificial session), for the sattra means everything , and this (cup) means everything. These are the drawings.
6	2	1	Verily, they who sit (sacrificing) for a year, by means of six months go to him that burns yonder:so it is told on the part of the Sâman, in as much as it is made of the form of that (sun) it is told on the part of the Rik ; and now in like manner on the part of the Yagus, by means of preparatory rite, when they draw that (graha) , they thereby also go to him (the sun).
6	2	2	He thus takes it therefrom with  , 'The lights bear on high that divine knower of beings, Sûrya, that all may see him!--Thou art drawn with a support: thee to Sûrya nor splendour!--This is thy womb: thee to Sûrya for splendour!'
6	3	1	Now as to the manner of animal offerings. One may perform with the (ordinary) set of eleven victims. He seizes one for Agni as the first victim, and one for Varuna (as the last); then again one for Agni.: in this way let him perform with the set of eleven victims .
6	3	2	Or one may day after day seize a victim for Indra and Agni; for all the gods are Agni, since in Agni offering is made to all the deities; and Indra is the deity of the sacrifice: thus he neither offends any of the deities, nor does he offend him who is the deity of the sacrifice.
6	3	3	Then as to the manner (of animal offering) in accordance with the Stoma . At the Agnishtomalet him seize a (victim) for Agni; for it is befitting that at the Agnishtoma ('Agni's praise') he should seize a victim for Agni. If it be an Ukthya sacrifice, let him seize as the second (victim) one for Indra and Agni, for the hymns (uktha)  belong to Indra and Agni. If it be a Shodasin sacrifice, let him seize as the third (victim) one for Indra; for the Shodasin (graha) is Indra. If it be an Atirâtra, let him seize as the fourth (victim) one for Sarasvatî; for Sarasvatî is Vâk (speech), and Vâk is a female, and so is râtri (fem., 'night') female. Thus he duly distinguishes between the sacrificial performances. Such are the three manners (of animal offering): he may perform in whichever manner he pleases. Two victims must needs be seized,--for Sûrya he seizes the second en the Vishuvant day, and for Pragâpati at the Mahâvrata.
6	4	1	Then as to the Mahâvratîya (graha) . Now when Pragâpati had created the living beings, hisjoints were relaxed: with his relaxed joints he was unable to raise himself. Then the gods went on praising and toiling. They saw this Mahâvratîya (cup) and drew it for him: thereby they restored his joints.
6	4	2	With his joints thus restored, he approached this food, what food of Pragâpati there is,--for what eating is to men, that the vrata (fast-food, or religious observance generally) is to the gods. And because (they say), 'Great, indeed, is this vrata whereby he has raised himself,' therefore it is called Mahâvratîya.
6	4	3	Now, even as Pragâpati then was, when he had created the living beings, so are those who sit (in sacrificial session) for a year; and as Pragâpati then, after a year, approached food, so do they now, after a year, approach food, for whomsoever that knows this, they draw that cup.
6	4	4	Let him draw it for Indra Vimridh (the Averter of scorn), for, verily, the scorners of those who sit fora year are smitten, and all is won by them: hence for Indra Vimridh,--with , 'Scatter thou our scorners, O Indra, lay them low that war against us, and send them, that persecute us, to the nethermost darkness!--Thou art taken with a support: thee to Indra Vimridh!--This is thy womb: thee to Indra Vimridh!'
6	4	5	Or for Visvakarman (the All-worker), for all work is done, everything is won by those who sit in session for a year: hence for Visvakarman,--with , 'Vâkaspati Visvakarman, the thought-speeder , let us invoke for protection in our struggle  this day: may he, the all-beneficient worker of good, delight in all our offerings  for our protection!--Thou art taken with a support: thee to Indra Visvakarman !--This is thy womb; thee to Indra Visvakarman!'
6	4	6	But if he knows the (verse) referring to Indra (and) Visvakarman, let him draw it thus  , 'O Visvakarman, with strengthening libation madest thou Indra an invincible champion: to him did the people bow down ofold, because  he, the mighty, is worthy of adoration.--Thou art taken with a support: thee to Indra Visvakarman!--This is thy womb: thee to Indra Visvakarman!'
6	5	1	Now the graha , forsooth, is he that burns yonder, since by him all these creatures are held (swayed). Hence they say, 'We take (grab) the grahas,' 'They walk, seized by the grahas.'
6	5	2	The graha, forsooth, is Vâk (speech); for by speech everything is swayed (grab) here ,--what wonder, then , that Vâk is the graha?
6	5	3	The graha, forsooth, is the name, for everything is held (fixed) by a name here,--what wonder, then, that the name is the graha? We know the names of many, and are they not thereby held by us ?
6	5	4	The graha, forsooth, is food; for by food everything is kept (grah) here: hence as many as eat our food, all those are kept by us. Such is the natural order of things.
6	5	5	And as to this graha of Soma, that is food; for whatever deity one draws this graha, that deity, being seized by this graha, fulfils that wish of his for which he draws it. He approaches either the rising or the setting sun, thinking, 'Thou art the seizer, seize thou N.N. by such and such a disease! may N.N. not obtain such and such!' (naming) him whom he hates; or with, 'May such and such a wish not be fulfilled to him!' and, assuredly, that wish is not fulfilled to him for whom he thus approaches (the sun).
6	6	1	Now once on a time the gods, while performing sacrifice, were afraid of an attack from the Asura-Rakshas. They said, 'Who of us shall sit on the south side; we will then enter upon the sacrifice on the north side in a place free from danger and injury.'
6	6	2	They said, 'He who is the strongest of us, let him sit on the south side; we will then enter upon the sacrifice on the north side in a place free from danger and injury.'
6	6	3	They said, 'Verily, Indra is the strongest of us: let Indra sit on the south side; we will then enter upon the sacrifice on the north side in a place free from danger and injury.'
6	6	4	They said to Indra, 'Verily, thou art the strongest of us: sit thou on the south side; we will then enter upon the sacrifice on the north side in a place free from danger and injury.'
6	6	5	He said, 'What will be my reward then?'--'The office of Brâhmanâkhamsin shall be thine, the Brahmasâman  shall be thine!'--Hence one elects the Brâhmanâkhamsin with, 'Indra is the Brahman, by virtue of the Brahmaship!' for to Indra belongs this (office). Indra sat on the south side, and they entered upon the sacrifice on the north side in a place free from danger and injury. Therefore let him who is the strongest sit on the south side, and let them then enter upon the sacrifice on the north side in a place free from danger and injury. Now he, forsooth, who is the most learned of Brâhmans, is the strongest of them; and as now any one is (able to become) a (superintendent) Brahman --nay, does he not sit still?--therefore whosoever is the strongestof them, let him sit on the south side, and let them then enter upon the sacrifice on the north side in a place free from danger and injury. Hence Brâhmans sit on the south side (of the vedi), and they enter upon the sacrifice on the north side in a place free from danger and injury.
6	6	6	When (the Prastotri) says, 'Brahman, we will chant, O Prasâstar!' then the Brahman mutters , 'This thy sacrifice, O divine Savitar, have they announced unto Brihaspati (the lord of prayer), the Brahman : therefore speed the sacrifice, speed the lord of the sacrifice, speed me !--Praise ye at the impulse (prasava) of Savitri!' The significance is the same (as before) . With this (text) must probably enter upon (the chant).
6	6	7	But one may also enter upon it with, 'O divine Savitar; this, O Brihaspati, forwards!' Therewith he hastes to Savitri for his impulsion, for he is the impeller (prasavitri) of the gods; and 'O Brihaspati, forwards!' he says, because Brihaspati is the Brahman of the gods,--thus he announces it to him who is the Brahman of the gods: therefore he says, 'O Brihaspati, forwards !'
6	6	8	The Maitrâvaruna then mutters, 'Impelledby the divine Savitri, acceptable to Mitra and Varuna!' Therewith he hastes to Savitri for his impulsion, for he is the impeller of the gods; and 'acceptable to Mitra and Varuna' he says, because Mitra and Varuna are the deities of the Maitrâvaruna (Prasâstri),--thus he announces it to those who are the deities of the Maitrâvaruna: therefore he says, 'acceptable to Mitra and Varuna.'
6	7	1	Threefold, forsooth, is science; the Riks, the Yagus, and the Sâmans. The Riks are this (earth), since it is thereon that he who sings them, does sing them; the Riks are speech, since it is by speech that he who sings them, does sing them. And the Yagus, forsooth, are the air, and the Sâmans the sky. That same threefold science is used in the Soma-sacrifice.
6	7	2	By the Rik he conquers this world, by the Yagus the air, and by the Sâman the sky. Therefore whosoever has learnt one of these sciences, let him endeavour to learn also what is contained in the two others: by the Rik, forsooth, he conquers this world, by the Yagus the air, and by the Sâman the sky.
6	7	3	This, then, is the thousandfold progeny of Vâk (speech) . Indra (obtained for his share) two-thirds, and Vishnu one-third : the Riks and Sâmans are Indra, and the Yagus are Vishnu. Therefore in the Sadas they perform (the Sastras and Stotras) with the Rik and Sâman, for the Sadas is Indra's own.
6	7	4	And by means of these Yagus they, as it were, bring forward (puras) that Vishnu, the sacrifice: hence the name 'puraskarana' (preparatory ceremony).
6	7	5	Both the Riks and the Sâmans are Speech, and the Yagus are the Mind. Now wherever this Speech was, there everything was done, everything was known; but wherever Mind was, there nothing whatever was done, nothing was known, for no one knows (understands) those who think in their mind.
6	7	6	The gods said to Speech, 'Go thou forward and make this known!' She said, 'What will be my reward then?'--'Whatever in the sacrifice is offered with Svâhâ, and without Vashat, that shall be thine!' Hence whatever in the sacrifice is offered with Svâhâ, and without Vashat, that belongs to Speech. She then went forward and made that known, saying, 'Do this so! do this so!'
6	7	7	Therefore they also perform with the Rik in the Havirdhâna: he (the Hotri) recites the morning prayer, he recites the kindling-verses; he (the Grâvastut) praises the pressing-stones,--for thus, indeed, they (Speech and Mind) became yoke-fellows.
6	7	8	And hence they also perform with the Yagus in the Sadas: they raise up the Udumbara post, they erect the Sadas, they throw up the dhishnya hearths,--for thus they became yoke-fellows.
6	7	9	That same Sadas they enclose on all sides with a view to that generation, thinking, 'Quite secretly shall be carried on that generation!' for improper, indeed, is the generation which another sees hence even when a husband and wife are seen, while carrying on intercourse, they run away from each other, for they give offence. Therefore to any one looking into the Sadas, except through the door, let him say, 'Look not!' for it is as if he were seeing intercourse being carried on. Freely (one may look) through the door, for the door is made by the gods.
6	7	10	In like manner they enclose the Havirdhâna on all sides with a view to that generation, thinking, 'Quite secretly this generation shall be carried on!' for improper, indeed, is the generation which another sees: hence even when a husband and wife are seen, while carrying on intercourse, they run away from each other, for they give offence. Therefore to any one looking into the Havirdhâna, except through the door, let him say, 'Look not!' for it is as if he were seeing intercourse being carried on. Freely (one may look) through the door, for the door is made by the gods.
6	7	11	Now there, in the Sadas, that male, the Sâman, longs after the female, the Rik. From that generation Indra was produced: from fire, indeed, fire is produced, viz. Indra from the Rik and the Sâman; for Indra they call him that burns yonder (the sun).
6	7	12	And there, in the Havirdhâna, that male, the Soma, longs after the female, the water. From that generation the moon was produced: from food, indeed, food is produced, viz. the moon from water and Soma; for the moon is the food of him that burns yonder . Hence he thereby produces the sacrificer, and for him he produces food: from the Rik and Sâman he produces the sacrificer, and from water and Soma he produces food for him.
6	7	13	Now with the Yagus the gods first performed sacrifice, then with the Rik, then with the Sâman and in like manner do they now perform the sacrifice. first with the Yagus, then with the Rik, then with the Sâman; for Yagus, they say, is the same as Yagas (worship).
6	7	14	Now when the gods milked (the objects of) their wishes from these sciences, the Yagus sciencemilked most wishes. It became, as it were, emptied the most; it was not equal to the other two sciences,--the air-world was not equal to the two other worlds.
6	7	15	The gods desired, 'How can this science become equal to the other two sciences; how can the air-world become equal to the two other worlds?'
6	7	16	They said, 'Let us perform in a low voice with the Yagus: then that science will become equal to the other two sciences; then the air-world will become equal to the two other worlds!'
6	7	17	They performed with them in a low voice, and thereby strengthened them; and henceforth that science was equal to the other two sciences, and the air-world was equal to the two other worlds. Therefore the Yagus, while being distinct, are yet indistinct; and therefore the air-world, while being distinct, is yet indistinct (indefinable).
6	7	18	He who performs with the Yagus in a low voice, strengthens them; and they, thus strengthened, strengthen him. But he who performs in a loud voice, weakens them, and, being weak, they weaken him.
6	7	19	The Riks and Sâmans, forsooth, are speech, and the Yagus are the mind; and so those who perform with the Rik and Sâman are speech, and those who perform with the Yagus are the mind. Hence nothing whatever is done, unless ordered by the Adhvaryu: when the Adhvaryu says, 'Recite (the invitatory prayer)! Pronounce the offering prayer!' then those who perform with the Rik perform it. And when the Adhvaryu says, 'Soma becometh pure: turn ye back !' then those who perform with the Sâman perform it,--for speech speaks not but what is conceived by the mind.
6	7	20	Thus, then, the Adhvaryu, the mind, walks, as it were, in front (puras-karati): hence the name 'puraskarana ;' and verily, he who knows this, stands, as it were, in front through prosperity and glory.
6	7	21	Now that same puraskarana (going before) is nothing else than yonder burning (sun): one ought to perform in accordance with his (the sun's) course. When he (the Adhvaryu) has drawn a cup of Soma, let him turn round in accordance with his course; when he has responded (to the Hotri's recitation), let him turn round in accordance with his course; when he has offered a graha, let him turn round in accordance with his course: he (the sun), verily, is the supporter; and whosoever, knowing this, is able to perform in accordance with his course, he, forsooth, is able to support his dependants .
6	8	1	Now the consecration-ceremony  (for the sacrificial session) is a sitting down, is a session (sattra): hence they say of them, 'they sit.' And when thereafter they perform the sacrifice, then they (under)go; then he, who is the leader, leads: hence they say of them, 'they (under)go .'
6	8	2	The consecration-ceremony, then, is a sitting down, it is a session, it is an (under)going, it is the (under)going of a session. And when afterwards, having reached the end of the sacrifice, they rise, that is 'the rising:' hence they say of them, 'They have risen.' So much, then, for preliminary remark.
6	8	3	Now those who are about to consecrate themselves settle (the time and place) between them. If they intend to construct a fire-altar, they take up their (ordinary sacrificial) fires on churning-sticks  and betake themselves together to where they are about to perform the animal offering to Pragâpati. Having churned (the fire), and put fire-wood on, they take out the Âhavanîya fire, and perform that animal offering to Pragâpati.
6	8	4	Its head they keep . If their consecration does not fall upon that same day (of the animal offering), then, taking up the fires (again) on the churning-sticks, they disperse to their several (homes) and perform the (daily) offerings.
6	8	5	But if their consecration falls upon that same day, then, taking up the fires (again) on the churning-sticks, they betake themselves to where they intend to perform the consecration-ceremony. The Grihapati  churns (his fire) first somewhere about the centre of the hall; and one half of the others settle down south and one half north of him. Havingchurned (their fires), and put on fire-wood, they take one fire-brand each and betake themselves together to the Grihapati's Gârhapatya fire. Having taken out the Âhavanîya from the Grihapati's Gârhapatya, they perform the consecration-ceremony. They have one and the same Âhavanîya, but different Gârhapatyas, during the consecration and the Upasads .
6	8	6	Then, on whatever day their purchase (of Soma-plants) takes place, on that day he raises the Gârhapatya hearth; and on the Upavasatha day  the dhishnya hearths for the others. At the time of the Vaisargina  offerings, the wives come forward together and they (the sacrificers) abandon those other (Gârhapatya) fires . As soon as the Vaisargina offering has been performed,--
6	8	7	He leads forward the king (Soma). That Âgnîdhrîya fire has just been taken up on the support , when they take one fire-brand each (from the fire at the hall-door) and disperse to their several dhishnya hearths: 'They who do so,' said Yâgñavalkya, 'slay with those fire-brands of theirs.' This now is one way.
6	8	8	Then there is this second. Having taken up their fires on churning-sticks, they betake themselves to where they intend to perform the animal offering to Pragâpati. Having churned (the fire), and put on (fire-wood), they take out the Âhavanîya and perform that animal offering to Pragâpati.
6	8	9	Its head they keep. If their consecration does not fall upon the same day, then, taking up the fires (again) on the churning-sticks, they disperse to their several (homes), and perform (the ordinary) offerings.
6	8	10	But if their consecration falls upon the same day, then, taking up the fires (again) on the churning-sticks, they betake themselves to where they intend to perform the consecration-ceremony. The Grihapati churns first, and then the others churn, seated round about him, and throw each the (fire) produced by him on the Grihapati's Gârhapatya. Having taken out the Âhavanîya from the Grihapati's Gârhapatya, they perform the Dîkshâ. Theirs is the same Âhavanîya and the same Gârhapatya during the consecration and the Upasads.
6	8	11	Then, on whatever day their purchase (of Soma-plants) takes place, on that day he piles up the Gârhapatya hearth, and on the Upavasatha day the dhishnya hearths for the others. At the time of the Vaisargina offerings the wives come forward together; they (the sacrificers) abandon that (common Gârhapatya) fire. As soon as the Vaisargina offering has taken place,--
6	8	12	He leads forward the king. That Âgnîdhrîya fire has just been taken up on the support, when they take one fire-brand each and disperse to their several dhishnya hearths. But those who do it thus, raiseup strife, and strife comes upon them; they become contentious, and, moreover, strife comes upon that community where they sacrifice. This is the second way.
6	8	13	Then there is this third. They commune with each other over the Grihapati's churning-sticks,--'What fire shall be produced therefrom, be that ours in common! what we shall gain by this sacrifice, by this animal offering, be that ours in common! In common be our good work! whosoever shall do evil, be that his alone!' Having thus spoken, the Grihapati first takes up (the fire on the churning-sticks) for himself, then he takes it up for the others, or they take it  up for themselves. They betake themselves to where they intend to perform the animal offering to Pragâpati. Having churned (the fire) and put on (fire-wood), they take out the Âhavanîya and perform that animal offering to Pragâpati.
6	8	14	Its head they keep. If their consecration does not fall on the same day, then, taking up (again) the fires on the churning-sticks, they disperse to their several (homes), and perform (the ordinary) offerings.
6	8	15	But if their consecration falls on the same day, they commune with each other over the Grihapati's churning-sticks,--'What fire shall be produced therefrom, be that ours in common! what we shall gain by this sacrifice, by this session, be that ours in common! In common be our good work! Whosoever shall do evil, be that his alone!' Having thus spoken, the Grihapati first takes up (the fire) on the churning-sticks for himself, then he takes it up forthe others, or they take it up for themselves. They betake themselves to where they intend to perform the consecration-ceremony. Having churned (the fire) and put on (fire-wood), they take out the Âhavanîya and perform the consecration-ceremony. Theirs is the same Âhavanîya and the same Gârhapatya during the consecration and the Upasads.
6	8	16	And on whatever day their purchase (of Soma-plants) takes place, on that day he piles up the Gârhapatya hearth, and on the Upavasatha day the dhishnya hearths for the others. At the time of the Vaisargina offerings the wives come forward together; and they (the sacrificers) abandon that (Gârhapatya) fire. As soon as the Vaisargina offering has been performed,
6	8	17	He leads forward the king. That Âgnîdhrîya fire has just been taken up on the support, when they take one fire-brand each and disperse to their several dhishnya hearths. Thus is this done, and not (left) undone. The reason why they have different dhishnyas, is that there may be wider space for moving about; and why they have different purodâsas , is that more sacrificial food may be left over for completeness.
6	8	18	Now then the sacrificial session is explained, whereby the gods quickly drove out evil, and gained the supreme authority which they now wield: having one Grihapati, one purodâsa, one dhishnya, they quickly drove out mischief and quickly were born again. And in like manner will these (sacrificers), by having one Grihapati, one purodâsa, one dhishnya, quickly drive out evil and be born again.
6	8	19	Now, in that former case, there is a hall with the roof-beams running from south to north ,--that is human practice. There are one and the same Âhavanîya, and different Gârhapatyas--that is dissimilar. On the Grihapati's Gârhapatya they perform the Patnîsamyâgas with the tail (of the victim), and the others sit offering in response with ghee--that is dissimilar:
6	8	20	But here there is a hall with the roof-beams running from west to east : that is as with the gods. There are the same Âhavanîya, the same Gârhapatya, and the same Âgnîdhrîya: thus this sacrificial session is successful, even as the one day's Soma-sacrifice was successful, there is no failure for it. Its course is one and the same in everything except the dhishnyas.
6	9	1	Now, once on a time, the gods were sitting  in a sacrificial session, thinking, 'May we attain excellence; may we be glorious, may we be eaters of food!' That same food, gained by them, wished to go away from them,--and, food being cattle, it was the cattle that wished to go away from them, thinking, 'It is to be feared lest they, being exhausted, may hurt us : how, indeed, will they deal with us?'
6	9	2	They offered these two oblations in the Gârhapatya;and--the Gârhapatya being a house (griha), and a house being a resting-place--they thereby secured them in the house, and thus that food, gained by them, did not go away from them.
6	9	3	And in like manner do these Sattrins now sit through a sacrificial session, thinking, 'May we attain excellence, may we be glorious, may we be eaters of food!' That food, gained by them, wishes to go away from them,--and, food being cattle, it is the cattle that wish to go away from them, thinking, 'It is to be feared lest they, being exhausted, may hurt us: how, indeed, will they deal with us?'
6	9	4	They offer these two oblations  in the Gârhapatya; and--the Gârhapatya being a house, and the house being a resting-place--they thereby secure them in the house, and thus that food, gained by them, does not go away from them.
6	9	5	And in like manner that offered food wishes to go away from him, thinking, 'It is to be feared lest this one will hurt me: how, indeed, will he deal with me?'
6	9	6	He first eats a very little from the further (back) end of it;--thereby he encourages it: it knows, 'It was not so as I thought: he has in no wise hurt me.' Thus it becomes attached to him, and, indeed, whosoever, knowing this, is able to observe the vow thereof, he becomes an eater of food, dear to food.
6	9	7	This, then, is done at the Sattrotthâna (rising from the session) on the tenth day . Each of themsits speechless, strengthening his voice : with that (voice) strengthened and reinvigorated they perform the last day. Then the others are dismissed, either (for) fetching fuel or to their day's reading of the scriptures. Now also they take food.
6	9	8	In the afternoon, having come together and touched water, they enter the ladies' hall , and while the others hold on to him from behind, he offers (on the Sâlâdvârya fire) those two oblations; (the first) with , 'Here is joy: here rejoice ye! here is stability, here is (your) own stability,--Hail!' He thereby addresses the cattle; they thereby secure cattle for themselves.
6	9	9	And the second he offers with, 'Letting the sucking calf to the mother,'--he means to say by this, 'letting the fire go to the earth;'--'a sucking calf drinking from the mother,'--he thereby means the fire sucking the (moisture of the) earth;--'may he maintain increase of wealth among us,--Hail!' increase of wealth is cattle: they thus secure cattle for themselves.
6	9	10	They go out eastward, and enter the (shed of the) Havirdhâna carts from behind towards the front; for from the front towards the back (they enter) when about to perform the sacrifice, but thus (it is done) at the rising from the session.
6	9	11	On the hinder shaft of the northern cart  they sing the Sâman , called 'the completion of the session,'--there it is that they reach completeness; or on the northern hip of the high altar; but the other is the more usual,
6	9	12	That is, on the hinder shaft of the northern cart. 'We have gone to the light, we have become immortal,'--for they who sit through a sacrificial session become indeed the light, theybecome immortal;--'to the sky have we ascended from the earth,'--for they who sit through a sacrificial session indeed ascend from the earth to the sky;--'we have attained to the gods,'--for they indeed attain to the gods;--'to heaven, to the light!' thrice they repeat the finale; for they indeed become (partakers of) heaven and bliss. Thus, whatever the nature of his Sâman is, that they come to be who sit through a sacrificial session.
6	9	13	They creep  along right under the axle of the southern cart: even as a snake frees itself from its skin, so do they free themselves from all evil. They creep along with an atikhandas verse; for that, the atikhandas (redundant metre), is all the metres;--thus evil does not overtake them: therefore they creep along with an atikhandas verse.
6	9	14	They creep along with , 'O Indra and Parvata, leaders in battle, smite ye every one that wars against us, smite him with the thunderbolt! him that is hidden may it please in the far retreat which he hath reached: our foes, O hero, on all sides may the tearer tear to pieces,--on all sides!'
6	9	15	They go out eastward, and enter the Sadas from the front towards the back; for from the back towards the front (they do so) when about to perform the sacrifice; but thus (they do) at the rising from the session.
6	9	16	They sit down by their several dhishnya-hearths. Now, once on a time, the pith of Vâk (speech) wished to desert the gods who had won it; it tried to creep away along this earth, for Vâk isthis earth: her pith are these plants and trees. By means of this Sâman  they overtook it, and, thus overtaken, it returned to them. Hence upwards on this earth grow the plants, and upwards the trees. And in like manner does the pith of Vâk wish to desert these (sacrificers) who have won it, and tries to creep away along this earth,--for Vâk is this earth: her pith are these plants and trees. By means of this Sâman they overtake it, and, thus overtaken, it returns to them. Hence upwards on this earth grow the plants, and upwards the trees.
6	9	17	They chant verses of the queen of serpents; for the queen of serpents is this earth: through her they thus obtain everything. The prelude is performed by (the Udgâtri) himself , and the chant is not joined in (by the choristers ), lest some one else overhear it. For he would cause (the performance) to be in excess were another to chant; he would cause an excess, were another to join in it; he would cause an excess, were another to overhear it: therefore the prelude is performed by (the Udgâtri) himself, and the chant is not joined in.
6	9	18	The Hotri recites the Four-Hotri formulas, whereby he follows up that chant by a Sastra . If the Hotri does not know them, let the Grihapati recite them; but it is the Hotri's recitation .
6	9	19	Then the Adhvaryu's response  is, 'These sacrificers have prospered: happiness hath accrued unto them!' whereby he bespeaks success to human speech.
6	9	20	Thereupon they utter the Brahmodya  in (the form of a) dialogue. For everything, indeed, is obtained, everything gained by them that sit through a sacrificial session,--they have performed with Yagus prayers: these have obtained so much, have acquired so much; they have recited Rik verses: these have obtained so much, have acquired so much; they have chanted Sâmans: these have obtained so much, have acquired so much. But this has not been obtained, this has not been acquired by them, namely, the (theological) discussion, the sacred discourse: this is what they thereby obtain, what they acquire.
6	9	21	Having 'crept' up to the Udumbara post, they restrain their speech. Now, they who perform the sacrifice with speech, milk and suck out thesacrifice; for sacrifice is speech. And previously to this, each of them sits speechless, strengthening his speech , and with their speech thus strengthened and reinvigorated they perform the last day. But at this (disputation) the entire speech, thus obtained, becomes exhausted: that speech they all strengthen (by remaining) speechless, and with it thus strengthened and reinvigorated they perform the Atirâtra .
6	9	22	They sit touching the Udumbara post , for strength is food, and the Udumbara tree is strength: with strength he thus invigorates speech.
6	9	23	When the sun has set, they go out (of the Sadas) eastward, and sit down behind the Âhavanîya, in front of the Havirdhâna shed. Round them, sitting speechless, the Pratiprasthâtri carries the Vasatîvarî water . For whatever object they perform the session, therewith let them release their speech. For in olden times the Rishis were wont to hold sacrificial sessions for certain objects,--'such is our wish: may that be fulfilled!' And if they be desirous of different objects, desirous of subjects, desirous of offspring, desirous of cattle,--
6	9	24	Let them release their speech with this , 'Earth! Air! Sky!' Thus they render their speech auspicious by means of the truth, and with that auspicious (speech) they pray for blessings,--'May we be abundantly supplied with offspring!'--thereby they pray for offspring;--'May we be abundantly supplied with men!'--thereby they pray for men;--'May we be abundantly supplied with food!' thereby they pray for prosperity.
6	9	25	Thereupon the Grihapati, or whomsoever the Grihapati may call upon, recites the Subrahmanyâ litany . Some, indeed, recite the Subrahmanyâ each separately; but rather let the Grihapati, or whomsoever the Grihapati may call upon, recite the Subrahmanyâ. Having desired an invitation to that (Atirâtra feast), they put kindling-sticks on the fire .
