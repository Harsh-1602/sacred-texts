1	1	1	Verily, Pragâpati, the Sacrifice, is the Year: the night of new moon is its gate, and the moon itself is the bolt of the gate.
1	1	2	And when one lays down the two fires at new moon ,--even as one would enter a stronghold by the gate, when the gate is open, and would thence reach the world of heaven, so it is when one lays down the fires at new moon.
1	1	2	And if one lays down the fires under a (special) asterism ,--just as if one tried to enter a stronghold, when the gate is closed, in some other way than through the gate, and failed to get inside the stronghold, so it is when one lays down the fires under an asterism: let him therefore not lay down the fires under an asterism.
1	1	4	On the same day on which that one (the moon) should not be seen either in the east or in the west,let him fast, for it is then that he (the moon) comes to this world , and on that (day) he abides here (on the sacrificial ground).
1	1	5	And all the gods abide (here), all the spirits, all the deities, all the seasons, all the Stomas (hymn-forms), all the Prishthas , and all the metres.
1	1	6	And, verily, it is for all the gods, for all spirits, for all deities, for all seasons, for all Stomas, for all Prishthas, and for all metres that the fires of him are laid down who lays them down at new moon: he should therefore lay them down at new moon.
1	1	7	He may lay down the fires on the new moon which falls in the (month) Vaisâkha, for that coincides with the Rohinî (asterism); for the Rohinî means the self, offspring and cattle : he thus becomes established in a self, in offspring and cattle. But, indeed, the new moon is the form of the Agnyâdheya: let him therefore lay down the fires at new moon;--let him perform the preliminary ceremony  at full moon, and the initiation ceremony at new moon.
1	2	1	Now when they spread (and perform) the sacrifice, they kill it; and when they press out king Soma, they kill him; and when they 'quiet' and cut up the victim, they kill it,--it is by means of the mortar and pestle, and by the two mill-stones that they kill the Haviryagña (grain-offering).
1	2	2	And having killed the sacrifice, he pours it, as seed, into the fire as its womb, for, indeed, the fire is the womb of the sacrifice, from out of it it is produced: let him therefore perform those ten oblations  for which the Vashat is uttered.
1	2	3	And, indeed, this sacrifice is the blowing (wind): he blows here, as it were, as a single one, but when he has entered into man, he is divided into ten parts;--with the vital airs thus distributed, it (the sacrifice) is born from out of its womb, the fire: this is that Virâg of ten syllables, this is that perfection, the sacrifice.
1	2	4	There may, however, be nine (oblations) ;--he thus forms a defective (lesser, lower) Virâg with a view to production; for from the lesser , indeed, creatures are produced here: this is that perfection, the sacrifice.
1	2	5	But there may be one additional (oblation) ,that one remains over for Pragâpati: this is that perfection, the sacrifice.
1	2	6	And there may be two additional (oblations) , --a productive pair consists of two: thus a productive pair is produced; this is that perfection, the sacrifice.
1	2	7	And there may be three additional ones ,--a productive pair consists of two, and that which is produced is the third: this is that perfection, the sacrifice.
1	2	8	And there may be four additional ones ,--as the one so the four. There are these three worlds; these worlds he thus gains by three (oblations); and Pragâpati, indeed, is the fourth beyond these worlds: by the fourth (oblation) he thus gains Pragâpati,--this is that perfection, the sacrifice.
1	2	9	That (sacrifice) which is defective in two (oblations)  is indeed defective, it is not a sacrifice; and that which is excessive in respect of five (oblations) is indeed excessive, it is not a sacrifice: this is that perfection as regards the ten, the twenty, thus up to a thousand .
1	2	10	Verily, they who perform the Full and New-moon sacrifice, run a race . One ought to perform it during fifteen years;--in these fifteen years there are three hundred and sixty full moons and newmoons; and there are in a year three hundred and sixty nights: it is the nights he thus gains.
1	2	11	He should then offer for another fifteen years; in these fifteen years there are three hundred and sixty full moons and new moons; and there are in a year three hundred and sixty days it is the days he thus gains, and the year itself he thus gains.
1	2	12	Now, indeed, the gods were at first mortal; and only when they had gained the year they were immortal; for the year is everything, and the imperishable means everything: thereby then accrues to him imperishable merit, the imperishable world.
1	2	13	He who, knowing this, offers (the Full and New-moon sacrifice) for thirty years, becomes one of the race-runners, whence one ought to offer sacrifice for not less than thirty years. But if he be a performer of the Dâkshâyana sacrifice , he need only offer for fifteen years, for therein that perfection is brought about, since he performs (every month) two Full-moon and two New-moon offerings, and thus that perfection is indeed brought about therein.
1	3	1	When he has performed the Full-moon sacrifice, he prepares an additional (cake) for Indra Vimridh (the repeller of scorners), and offers it in accordance with the procedure of an ishti ; and when he has performed the New-moon sacrifice, he prepares an additional rice-pap for Aditi , and offers it in accordance with the procedure of an ishti.
1	3	2	And as to why, after performing the Full-moon sacrifice, he prepares (a cake) for Indra Vimridh, it is because Indra is the deity of the sacrifice; but the chief oblation of the Full-moon sacrifice belongs to Agni and Soma, and nothing is offered there with the formula 'To Indra (I offer) thee!' Hereby then that oblation comes to be shared by Indra, and so does the sacrifice come to be shared by Indra. And as to why (he offers) with 'To (Indra) Vimridh!' it is that by the Full-moon sacrifice he slays all scorners (mridh), all evil spirits.
1	3	3	And as to why, after performing the New-moon sacrifice, he prepares a pap for Aditi,--that moon doubtless is the same as King Soma, the food of the gods: when on that night he is not seen either in the east or in the west, the oblation becomes, as it were, uncertain and unfirm. Now Aditi is this earth, and she, indeed, is certain and firmly established: thereby, then, that oblation of his becomes certain and firmly established. Such, then, is the reason why he prepares additional oblations; now as to why he should not prepare them.
1	3	4	When, after performing the Full-moon sacrifice, he prepares an additional (cake) for Indra Vimridh, he does so in order that his sacrifice should become shared in by Indra, for every sacrifice belongs to Indra. But inasmuch as every sacrifice belongs to Indra, thereby that oblation of his, and that sacrifice, is already shared in by Indra.
1	3	5	And when, after performing the New-moon sacrifice, he prepares an additional pap for Aditi,--surely the New-moon sacrifice is itself an additional one; for by the Full-moon sacrifice Indra slew Vritra, and for him who had slain Vritra, the godsthen prepared that additional oblation, the New-moon sacrifice: why, then, should he prepare an oblation to be added to an additional offering? Let him, therefore, not prepare the additional oblations.
1	3	6	When, after performing the Full-moon sacrifice, he afterwards prepares another oblation; and when, after performing the New-moon sacrifice, he afterwards prepares another oblation, he rises and defies his malicious enemy; and, indeed, unassailed and undisturbed is the prosperity of him who at full moon performs the Full-moon sacrifice, and at new moon the New-moon sacrifice .
1	3	7	For by performing the Full-moon sacrifice at full moon, and the New-moon sacrifice at new moon, the gods forthwith dispelled evil, and were forthwith reproduced; and, verily, he who, knowing this, performs the Full-moon sacrifice at full moon, and the New-moon sacrifice at new moon, forthwith dispels evil, and is forthwith reproduced. If he offer an additional oblation, let him give a sacrificial fee (to the priests); for no oblation, they say, should be without a dakshinâ; and for the Full and New-moon sacrifices there is that dakshinâ, to wit, the Anvâhârya (mess of rice ). Thus much as to the additional oblations; now as to (the sun) rising over him.
1	4	1	Now, some people enter upon the fast  whenthey (still) see (the moon, on the fourteenth day of the half-month), thinking, 'To-morrow he will not rise,'--either on account of clouds or not having ascertained properly, they enter upon the fast, and (in the morning) he rises over him. Now if he (the moon) should rise on (the material for) the oblation being not yet taken out, then that approved (procedure is followed) and the same fasting-observance. The sour curds from last night's milking they use for coagulating the sacrificial food ; they let the calves join (their mothers), and drive them away again .
1	4	2	In the afternoon he drives them away with the parna-branch; and as there that approved oblation of the New-moon offering (is prepared) so here. But if he should not care to undergo (again) the fasting-observance, or if (the moon) were to rise over (the material for) the oblation already taken out, then let him do otherwise: having properly cleansed the rice-grains of the husks, he cooks the smaller ones as a cake on eight potsherds for Agni Dâtri (the Giver).
1	4	3	And the sour curds (from the milk) milked on the day before (he prepares) for Indra Pradâtri (the Bestower); and those (larger) rice-grains  he cooks in boiled fresh milk as a pap for Vishnu Sipivishta (the Bald); for a pap it is whenever rice-grains are thrown (into milk or sour curds).
1	4	4	And as to this being so, it is because that moon is no other than King Soma, the food of the gods;--he (the Sacrificer) at that time sought to secure him , and missed him: Agni, the Giver, gives that (moon) to him, and Indra, the Bestower, bestows that one upon him; Indra and Agni give that (moon, Soma) as a sacrifice to him, and that sacrifice given by Indra and Agni he offers. And as to why (he offers) to Vishnu, the Bald, it is because Vishnu is the sacrifice; and as to why to the Bald  (sipivishta),--it is that his missing him whom he sought to secure is the bald part (? sipita) of the sacrifice, hence to the Bald one. And on this occasion he should give (to the priests) as much as he is able to give, for no oblation, they say, should be without a dakshinâ. And let him observe the fast just (on the day) when he (the moon) does not rise.
1	5	1	He observes the fast thinking, 'To-day is the day of new moon ;' and then that (moon) is seen inthe west. But, indeed, he (the moon) is that heavenly dog: he watches the Sacrificer's cattle (to seize them), and that would not be good for cattle if amends were not made to them ; and through fear of that 'down-coming moon ,' as they think him to be,--
1	5	2	They steal away into the shade. And therefore, indeed, people call that burning pain 'svalukita' (dog's clutch);--and therefore they also call that one--
1	5	3	'The hare in the moon .' Soma, the food of the gods, indeed, is the moon: at full moon they press him; and in the subsequent half of the month he enters the waters and plants; and, the cattle feeding on the water and the plants, he then during that night (of new moon) collects him from the cattle.
1	5	4	He keeps the fast thinking, 'To-day is the day of new moon;' and then that (moon) is seen in the west, and the Sacrificer departs from the path of sacrifice. As to this they say, 'What should one do when he has departed from the path of the sacrifice? Should he sacrifice, or should he not sacrifice?' He should certainly sacrifice, for there is no other way out of it: day after day that (moon) rises larger. Having performed offering after the manner of the New-moon sacrifice, he takes out material for an additional offering either on the same, or on the following day.
1	5	5	There are three chief oblations for this (offering),--(he prepares) a cake on eight potsherds for Agni Pathikrit (the path-maker), one on eleven potsherds for Indra Vritrahan (the slayer of Vritra), and a cake on twelve potsherds for Agni Vaisvânara.
1	5	6	Now as to why he prepares (an oblation) for Agni Pathikrit,--it is that Agni, being the maker of the path, leads the Sacrificer (back) to the path of sacrifice, from which he now departs.
1	5	7	And as to why to Indra Vritrahan,--Vritra is sin: with the help of Indra, the slayer of Vritra, he thus slays sin, Vritra, which ever keeps him from well-being, from virtue, and from the good work: this is why he (offers) to Indra Vritrahan.
1	5	8	And as to why he prepares a cake on twelve potsherds for Agni Vaisvânara,--when Indra had slain Vritra, he burnt him completely by means of Agni Vaisvânara, and thereby burnt all his (Vritra's) sin; and in like manner does that (Sacrificer) now, after slaying sin, Vritra, with the help of Indra Vritrahan, burn him, and all that sin of his, by means of Agni Vaisvânara; and, verily, not the slightest sin remains in him who, knowing this, performs this offering.
1	5	9	For this (offering) there are seventeen kindling-verses. He offers to the deities in a low voice, and makes any (verses) he pleases his invitatory and offering-formulas. In like manner (those of) the two butter-portions and the two formulas of the Svishtakrit.
1	5	10	A bow with three arrows he gives as dakshinâ; for with the bow a dog is driven away: he thus drives away that (dog, the moon) when he gives a bow with three arrows as dakshinâ.
1	5	11	A staff he gives as dakshinâ; for with a staffa dog is driven away: he thus drives away that (dog) when he gives a staff as dakshinâ. This, indeed, is the prescribed dakshinâ; but he may give anything else besides, of such other (objects meet for) dakshinâs as may be at his disposal. This, doubtless, is an offering relating to cattle: he may perform it even though (the moon) was not seen (at his New-moon sacrifice).
1	6	1	Verily, in the beginning this (universe) was water, nothing but a sea of water. The waters desired, 'How can we be reproduced?' They toiled and performed fervid devotions , when they were becoming heated, a golden egg was produced. The year, indeed, was not then in existence: this golden egg floated about for as long as the space of a year.
1	6	2	In a year's time a man, this Pragâpati, was produced therefrom; and hence a woman, a cow, or a mare brings forth within the space of a year; for Pragâpati was born in a year. He broke open this golden egg. There was then, indeed, no resting-place: only this golden egg, bearing him, floated about for as long as the space of a year.
1	6	3	At the end of a year he tried to speak. He said 'bhûh': this (word) became this earth;--'bhuvah': this became this air;--'svah': this became yonder sky. Therefore a child tries tospeak at the end of a year, for at the end of a year Pragâpati tried to speak.
1	6	4	When he was first speaking Pragâpati spoke (words) of one syllable and of two syllables; whence a child, when first speaking, speaks (words) of one syllable and of two syllables.
1	6	5	These (three words consist of), five syllables: he made them to be the five seasons, and thus there are these five seasons. At the end of the (first) year, Pragâpati rose to stand on these worlds thus produced; whence a child tries to stand up at the end of a year, for at the end of a year Pragâpati stood up.
1	6	6	He was born with a life of a thousand years: even as one might see in the distance the opposite shore, so did he behold the opposite shore (the end) of his own life.
1	6	7	Desirous of offspring, he went on singing praises and toiling. He laid the power of reproduction into his own self. By (the breath of) his mouth he created the gods: the gods were created on entering the sky; and this is the godhead of the gods (deva) that they were created on entering the sky (div). Having created them, there was, as it were, daylight for him; and this also is the godhead of the gods that, after creating them, there was, as it were, daylight (diva) for him.
1	6	8	And by the downward breathing he created the Asuras: they were created on entering this earth. Having created them there was, as it were, darkness for him.
1	6	9	He knew, 'Verily, I have created evil for myself since, after creating, there has come to be, as it were, darkness for me.' Even then he smotethem with evil, and owing to this it was that they were overcome; whence people say, 'Not true is that regarding (the fight between) the gods and Asuras which is related partly in the tale and partly in the legend; for it was even then that Pragâpati smote them with evil, and it was owing to this that they were overcome.'
1	6	10	Therefore it is with reference to this that the Rishi has said, 'Not for a single day hast thou fought, nor hast thou any enemy, O Maghavan illusion is what they say concerning thy battles; no foe hast thou fought either to-day or aforetime.'
1	6	11	Now what daylight, as it were, there was for him, on creating the gods, of that he made the day; and what darkness, as it were, there was for him, on creating the Asuras, of that he made the night: they are these two, day and night.
1	6	12	Pragâpati bethought himself, 'Everything (sarva), indeed, I have obtained by stealth (tsar) who have created these deities:' this became the 'sarvatsara,' for 'sarvatsara,' doubtless, is the same as 'samvatsara (year).' And, verily, whosoever thus knows 'samvatsara' to be the same as 'sarvatsara ,' is not overcome by any evil which, by magic art, steals upon him (tsar); and whosoever thus knows 'samvatsara' to be the same as 'sarvatsara,' overcomes against whomsoever he practises magic art.
1	6	13	Pragâpati bethought himself, 'Verily, I have created here a counterpart of myself, to wit, the year;' whence they say, 'Pragâpati is the year;' for he created it to be a counterpart of himself:inasmuch as 'samvatsara (year),' as well as 'Pragâpati,' consists of four syllables, thereby it (the year) is a counterpart of him.
1	6	14	Now, these are the deities who were created out of Pragâpati,--Agni, Indra, Soma, and Parameshthin Prâgâpatya.
1	6	15	They were born with a life of a thousand years: even as one would see in the distance the opposite shore, so did they behold the opposite shore of their own life.
1	6	16	They went on singing praises and toiling. Then Parameshthin, son of Pragâpati, saw that sacrifice, the New and Full-moon offerings, and performed these offerings. Having performed them, he desired, 'Would I were everything here!' He became the waters, for the waters are everything here, inasmuch as they abide in the furthest place; for he who digs here on earth finds indeed water; and, in truth, it is from that furthest place, to wit, from yonder sky that he  rains, whence the name Parameshthin (abiding in the furthest, highest place).
1	6	17	Parameshthin spake unto his father Pragâpati, 'I have discovered a sacrifice which fulfils wishes: let me perform this for thee!'--'So be it!' he said. He accordingly performed it  for him. Having sacrificed, he (Pragâpati) desired, 'Would I were everything here!' He became the breath (vital air), for breath is everything here: Pragâpati is that breath which blows here (the wind); and whatsoever knows that it is thus he blows is his (Pragâpati's) eyesight; and whatsoever is endowedwith breath is Pragâpati. And, verily, whosoever thus knows that eyesight of Pragâpati becomes, as it were, manifest,
1	6	18	Pragâpati spake unto his son Indra, 'Let me perform for thee this wish-fulfilling sacrifice which Parameshthin has just performed for me.'--'So be it!' he said. He accordingly performed it for him. Having sacrificed, he (Indra) desired, 'Would that I were everything here!' He became speech (vâk), for speech is everything here; whence they say, 'Indra is Vâk.'
1	6	19	Indra spake unto his brothers Agni and Soma, 'Let me perform for you this wish-fulfilling sacrifice which our father Pragâpati has just performed for me.'--'So be it!' they said. He accordingly performed it for them. Having sacrificed, those two desired, 'Would that we were everything here!' One of them became the eater of food, and the other became food: Agni became the eater of food, and Soma food; and the eater of food, and food, indeed, are everything here.
1	6	20	These five deities, then, performed that wish-fulfilling sacrifice; and for whatever wish they sacrificed, that wish of theirs was fulfilled; and, verily, for whatever wish one performs that sacrifice, that wish of his is fulfilled.
1	6	21	When they had sacrificed they beheld (discovered) the eastern quarter, and made it the eastern (front) quarter; as it now is that eastern (front) quarter: therefore creatures here move in a forward direction, for they (the gods) made that the front quarter. 'Let us improve it  from here!'they said, and made it to be strength, 'May we see  this strength!' they said; and it became yonder sky .
1	6	22	They then beheld the southern quarter, and made it the southern quarter; and it now is that southern (right, dakshinâ) quarter: whence the dakshinâ (cows) stand to the south (of the altar) , and are driven up from the south, for they made that the southern one (dakshinâ). 'Let us improve it from here!' they said, and made it to be space. 'May we see this space!' they said; and it became this air, for that (air) is space; for even as the resting-place here in this world is clearly the earth, so the resting-place there in yonder world is clearly this air; and because, whilst being here on earth, one does not see that space, therefore people say, 'That space (or, yonder world) is invisible.'
1	6	23	They then beheld the western quarter, and made it (to represent) hope,--wherefore it is only when , after going forwards (to the east), oneobtains (his object) that he goes (back) to that (western) quarter; for they (the gods) made that (quarter to represent) hope. 'Let us improve it from here!' they said, and made it to be prosperity (or distinction). 'May we see this prosperity!' they said; and it became this earth, for this (earth) is indeed (the source of) prosperity; whence he who obtains most therefrom becomes the most prosperous.
1	6	24	They then beheld the northern quarter, and made it the waters. 'Let us improve it from here!' they said, and made it (to represent) the law, for the waters are the law: hence whenever the waters come (down) to this (terrestrial) world everything here comes to be in accordance with the law; but whenever there is drought, then the stronger seizes upon the weaker, for the waters are the law.
1	6	25	These then are eleven deities ,--there are five fore-offerings, two butter-portions, the Svishtakrit, and three after-offerings:--
1	6	26	These are eleven offerings,--it was, indeed, by these offerings that the gods gained these worlds, and these quarters; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), by these offerings, gain these worlds, and these quarters.
1	6	27	And the four Patnîsamyâgas are the four intermediate quarters; and, indeed, it was by the four Patnîsamyâgas that the gods gained the intermediate quarters; and by means of them this (Sacrificer) now gains the intermediate quarters.
1	6	28	And as to the Idâ,--thereby the gods gained food; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) thereby gain food. This, then, is the completeness of the New and Full-moon sacrifices as regards the gods.
1	6	29	Now as to the body:--there are in man these five breathings, not including the eyes; they are the five fore-offerings, and the two butter-portions are the eyes.
1	6	30	The Svishtakrit is the same as this downward breathing; and because he offers that (oblation), as it were, apart from the other oblations , therefore all the breathings recoil from that breathing; and because for the Svishtakrit he cuts portions from all the sacrificial dishes, therefore everything that enters these (channels of the other) breathings meets in (the channel of) that breathing.
1	6	31	The three after-offerings are the three male organs ; and that which is the chief after-offering is, as it were, the chief organ. 'He should offer it without drawing breath ,' they say, 'for thus it becomes unfailing for him.'
1	6	32	He may, however, draw breath once, for that (organ) has one joint; but if it were jointless, iteither would only stand erect, or it would hang down; whilst now it both becomes erect and hangs down: he may therefore draw breath once.
1	6	33	The four Patnîsamyâgas are the two arms (or front legs) and the two thighs--the support, in fact ; and the Idâ is this vital air (in the centre); and inasmuch as that (Idâ) is not offered in the fire, but remains as unburnt, therefore this (central) vital air is undivided.
1	6	34	The invitatory and offering-formulas are the bone, and the offering-material is the flesh. The invitatory and offering-formulas are (in) measured metre, whence the bones of a fat and a lean person are alike: but inasmuch as he takes now more, now less, offering-material, therefore the flesh of a fat person is fat, and the flesh of a lean person is lean. This sacrifice he performs to any deity he pleases and for whom there is a sacrificial dish.
1	6	35	Now, these are offerings from which nothing must be omitted; but were one to omit anything of them, it would be as if he were to break off some limb, or knock out some (channel of the) vital air. Other oblations, indeed, are either added to or omitted.
1	6	36	These, then, are sixteen offerings, for man consists of sixteen parts, and the sacrifice is the Man (Purusha): hence there are sixteen offerings.
1	7	1	Now there, on the occasion of the entering on the fast, it is said , 'If he does not eat, he becomesconsecrated to the Fathers ; and if he does eat he eats whilst passing over the gods;' and, in this respect, they lay down the rule, 'Let him therefore eat what grows in the forest.'
1	7	2	If he eats cultivated plants he eats the sacrificial essence of the offering-cake; and if he eats forest plants he eats the essence of the barhis ; and if he eats aught of trees he eats the essence of the fuel (for the sacrificial fire); and if he drinks milk he consumes the essence of the Sânnâyya ; and if he drinks water he consumes the essence of the lustral waters ; and if he eats nothing he becomes consecrated to the Fathers.
1	7	3	As to this they say, 'What course of procedure is there?' Well, let him, on those two nights (of full and new moon), himself offer the Agnihotra: inasmuch as, after offering, he takes food he does not become consecrated to the Fathers, for that (libation) is an offering; and inasmuch as he performs that offering in his own self he does not eat of those sacrificial essences.
1	7	4	Now all the nights concentrate themselves in these two nights: all the nights of the waxing moon concentrate in the night of full moon, and all the nights of the waning moon concentrate in the night of new moon; and, verily, for him who, knowing this, offers (the Agnihotra) himself on the day ofthe entrance on the fast, offering is always made by himself .
1	8	1	Now, the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pragâpati, once strove together. Then the Asuras, even through arrogance, thinking, 'Unto whom, forsooth, should we make offering?' went on offering into their own mouths. They came to naught, even through arrogance: wherefore let no one be arrogant, for verily arrogance is the cause of ruin .
1	8	2	But the gods went on offering unto one another. Pragâpati gave himself up to them, and the sacrifice became theirs; for, indeed, the sacrifice is the food of the gods.
1	8	3	Having given himself up to the gods, he created that counterpart of himself, to wit, the sacrifice: whence people say, 'The sacrifice is Pragâpati;' for he created it as a counterpart of himself.
1	8	4	By this (Full and New-moon) sacrifice he redeemed himself from the gods. Now when he (the Sacrificer) enters on the fast, he thereby gives himself up to the gods, even as Pragâpati thereby gave himself up to the gods. Let him therefore endeavour to pass that night (with his mind) completely restrained , in the same way as he wouldproceed with (material for) an oblation, for he becomes an oblation to the gods.
1	8	5	And when (on the following day) he performs the sacrifice, then he redeems himself by sacrifice from the gods, even as Pragâpati thereby redeemed himself: when he takes out the material for (the chief) sacrificial dish, he redeems the sacrifice by the material for the sacrificial dish; the sacrificial dish (he redeems) by the invitatory formula, the invitatory formula by the portion cut (from the sacrificial dish), the portion by the offering-formula, the offering--formula by the Vashat-call, and the Vashat-call by the oblation. His oblation itself is still unredeemed,--
1	8	6	And that sacrifice of his is like a tree with its top broken off. He redeems the oblation by the Anvâhârya (mess of rice) ; and because he thereby supplies (anv-â-harati) what is wanting in the sacrifice, therefore it is called Anvâhârya. Thus, then, that entire sacrifice of his comes to be redeemed; and that sacrifice becomes the Sacrificer's self in yonder world. And, verily, the Sacrificer who, knowing this, performs that (offering of) redemption comes into existence in yonder world with a complete body.
2	1	1	Verily, man is born thrice, namely in this way:--first he is born from his mother and father; and when he to whom the sacrifice inclines performs offering he is born a second time; and when he dies, and they place him on the fire, and when hethereupon comes into existence again, he is born a third time;--wherefore they say, 'Man is born thrice.'
2	1	2	He (the Hotri) recites those eleven kindling-verses ,--there are these ten vital airs in man, and the body in which these vital airs are established is the eleventh,--so great, indeed, is man: he thus causes him to be born complete. And what comes after the kindling-verses that is the foundation: thus, having caused him to be born, he establishes him.
2	1	3	There are nine utterances of impulsion (or quickening) ,--there are these nine vital airs in man: he thereby causes him to be born a second time; and the (Adhvaryu's) call and (the Âgnîdhra's) response  are the foundation. And when there, on the occasion of the throwing  (of the grass-bunchinto the fire), birth is spoken of, he thereby causes him to be born a third time: on this occasion the Patnîsamyâgas  are the foundation.
2	1	4	For thrice, indeed, man is born, and it is just in this way that he causes him to be born thrice from the sacrifice. Of those eleven (kindling-verses) he recites thrice the first and last:--
2	1	5	This makes fifteen kindling-verses,--there are two libations of ghee (âghâra ), five fore-offerings, the Idâ, three after-offerings, the Sûktavâka, and Samyorvâka --that makes thirteen oblations. And when there, at the Patnîsamyâgas, he takes up at the same time (the two spoons); and the Samishtayagus :--
2	1	6	That makes fifteen oblations:--for these fifteen oblations those fifteen kindling-verses (serve, as it were, as) invitatory formulas; and for these invitatory formulas these (serve as) offering-formulas--whatever formula (is used) there (at those oblations) and what Nigada (is used at the invocation of the Idâ ) that is of the form of offering-formulas. Thereby, then, those oblations of his come to be supplied with invitatory formulas through those kindling-verses; and through those oblations those invitatory formulas come to be supplied with both offering-formulas and oblations.
2	2	1	He recites a gâyatrî invitatory formula : the gâyatrî consisting of three feet, these worlds being three in number , it is these worlds the gods thereby established.
2	2	2	He offers with a trishtubh (verse): the trishtubh consisting of four feet, and cattle being four-footed, it is cattle the gods thereby established in these established worlds.
2	2	3	The Vashat-call consists of two syllables (vaushat): man being two-footed; it is two-footed man they thereby established among the established cattle.
2	2	4	Two-footed man, then, is established here among cattle. In like manner this (Sacrificer) establishes thereby the worlds; and in the established worlds he establishes cattle, and among the established cattle he establishes himself: thus, indeed, is that man established among cattle, who, knowing this, offers sacrifice.
2	2	5	And when he offers, after the Vashat has been uttered,--that Vashat-call being yonder shining (sun), and he being the same as Death --he thereby consecrates him (the Sacrificer) after death, and causes him to be born from out of it, and he isdelivered from that death. And the sacrifice, indeed, becomes his body: thus, having become the sacrifice, he is delivered from that death, and all his chief offerings are thereby delivered from that death .
2	2	6	And, verily, whatever offering he there performs, that offering becomes his body in yonder world; and when he who knows this departs this world then that offering, being behind him, calls out to him, 'Come hither, here I am, thy body;' and inasmuch as it calls out (invokes, âhvayati), it is called 'âhuti' (offering or invocation).
2	3	1	Verily, in the beginning, this (universe) was the Brahman (neut.) . It created the gods; and, having created the gods, it made them ascend these worlds: Agni this (terrestrial) world, Vâyu the air, and Sûrya the sky.
2	3	2	And the deities who are above these he made ascend the worlds which are above these; and, indeed, just as these (three) worlds and these (three) deities are manifest, so are those (higher) worlds and those (higher) deities manifest--(the worlds) which he made those deities ascend.
2	3	3	Then the Brahman itself went up to the sphere beyond. Having gone up to the sphere beyond, it considered, 'How can I descend again into these worlds?' It then descended again by means of these two--Form and Name. Whatever has a name,that is name; and that again which has no name, and which one knows by its form, 'This is (of a certain) form,' that is form: as far as there are Form and Name so far, indeed, extends this (universe).
2	3	4	These, indeed, are the two great forces of the Brahman; and, verily, he who knows these two great forces of the Brahman becomes himself a great force.
2	3	5	These, indeed, are the two great manifestations  of the Brahman; and, verily, he who knows these two great manifestations of the Brahman becomes himself a great manifestation. One of these two is the greater, namely Form; for whatever is Name, is indeed Form; and, verily, he who knows the greater of these two, becomes greater than he whom he wishes to surpass in greatness.
2	3	6	In the beginning, indeed, the gods were mortal, and only when they had become possessed  of the Brahman they were immortal. Now, when he makes the libation to Mind --form being mind, inasmuch as it is by mind that one knows, 'This is form'--he thereby obtains Form; and when he makes the libation to Speech--name being speech, inasmuch as it is by speech that he seizes (mentions) the name--he thereby obtains Name;--as far as there are Form and Name, so far, indeed, extends this whole (universe): all this he obtains; and--theall being the imperishable--imperishable merit and the imperishable world thus accrue to him.
2	3	7	There, on the occasion of the offering to Agni , it has been told how the sacrifice then pleased the Rishis, and how they performed it. Now, when the Rishis were performing the sacrifice, the Gandharvas came nigh to them. They looked on, thinking, 'Here, surely, they have done too much,--here they have done too little.' And when their sacrifice was completed, they pointed it out to them, saying, 'Here, surely, ye have done too much,--here ye have done too little.'
2	3	8	Now, wherever they had done too much it was like a hill; and wherever they had done too little it was like a pit.
2	3	9	Now, when he pronounces the Samyos (all-hail and blessing), he touches (the earth ) with , 'O Sacrifice, homage be unto thee: mayest thou complete thy course up to the success of the sacrifice and up to mine own right offering!' Wherever (in the course of the sacrifice) he has committed any excess, he makes amends for it by doing homage; and wherever he has left anything defective, it ceases to be defective by his saying, 'up to.' In saying, 'Mayest thou complete thy course up to the success of the sacrifice,'--success being whatever in the sacrifice is neither defective nor excessive--he thereby makes amends for both of these (mistakes); and in saying, 'Mayest thou complete thycourse up to mine own right offering,'--right offering being whatever in the sacrifice is neither defective nor excessive--he thereby also makes amends for both of these (mistakes); and thus that sacrifice of his comes to be performed as one that is neither defective nor excessive by whosoever, knowing this, thus touches (the earth): let him therefore touch it just in this way. But, indeed, those Gandharvas were Yavamân (rich in barley), the winnowing-basket; Uddâlavân (rich in paspalum frumentaceum), husbandry; and Antarvân (the pregnant), grain .
2	4	1	The full moon, doubtless, is the same as that burning (sun), for he, indeed, is full day by day; and the new moon (darsa) is the same as the moon, for he appears (dars), as it were.
2	4	2	But they also say inversely, 'The full moon is the same as the moon, for after the filling up of the latter there is the night of full moon;' and the new moon (darsa) is the same as that burning (sun), for the latter appears, as it were.
2	4	3	The full moon, indeed, is this (earth), for she is, as it were, full; and the new moon is yonder sky, for yonder sky appears (or, is seen), as it were.
2	4	4	The full moon, indeed, is the night, for thisnight is, as it were, full; and the new moon is the day, for this day appears, as it were. This, then, is the theory regarding the full and new moon in respect of the gods.
2	4	5	Then as to the body. The full moon is the up-breathing, for it is by the up-breathing  that this man is, as it were, filled; and the new moon is the out (and in)-breathing , for this out-breathing appears, as it were: thus, the full and new moon are these two, the eater and the giver of food.
2	4	6	The out (and in)-breathing (the mouth) is the eater of food, for by means of the out (and in)-breathing this food is eaten; and the up-breathing is the giver of food, for by the up-breathing  this food is given to him.
2	4	7	The full moon is the mind, for full, as it were, is this mind; and the new moon is speech, for this speech appears, as it were. Thus these two are clearly the full and new moon, as regards the body; and inasmuch as on the day of fasting he eats the (food) suitable for eating on the vow, he thereby clearly gratifies these two in regard to the body; and on the morrow (he gratifies them) as gods by sacrifice.
2	4	8	As to this they say,--'Seeing that no offering-material is taken out "for the full moon," nor any offering-material "for the new moon," and seeing that he does not say, "Recite the invitatory formula for the full moon," nor "Recite the invitatory formulafor the new moon;" nor "Recite the offering-formula for the full moon," nor "Recite the offering-formula for the new moon," how, then, is offering made to this full and new moon?' Well, when he makes a libation of ghee to the Mind--the full moon being the Mind--he thereby makes offering to the full moon; and when he makes a libation of ghee to Speech--the new moon being Speech--he thereby makes offering to the new moon: and thus offering is made by him to the full and new moon.
2	4	9	Now, some prepare two messes of rice, one for Sarasvat on the full moon, and one for Sarasvatî on the new moon, saying, 'We thus clearly make offering to the full and new moon.' But let him not do this; for Sarasvat is the Mind, and Sarasvatî is Speech; and thus, in making libations of ghee to these two, offering is made by him to the full and new moon: let him therefore not prepare these two messes of rice.
2	4	10	As to this they say, 'Surely, he who performs the Full and New-moon offerings becomes a (mere) utterer of the Âgur ; for, when he has performedthe Full-moon offering, he knows that he will perform the New-moon offering; and when he has performed the New-moon offering, he knows that he will again perform the Full-moon offering; thus when he goes to the other world he goes thither as an utterer of the Âgur: how, then, does he become one who has not (merely) uttered the Âgur?' Well, when, on both occasions, he makes those two libations of ghee (to Mind and Speech), then his Full and New-moon offerings become complete; and he goes to the other world after his Full and New-moon offerings are completed, and thus becomes one who has not (merely) uttered the Âgur.
2	5	1	And, verily, even on this occasion , they slaughter the sacrificial horse (Asvamedha) as a sacrifice to the gods: of this (New and Full-moon sacrifice) they say, 'It is the original (normal) Asvamedha;' and that (real Asvamedha), indeed, is just the other (modified one); for, indeed, the Asvamedha is the same as the moon.
2	5	2	As to this, they say, 'For each foot of the sacrificial horse they offer an oblation;'--when he performs the Agnihotra in the evening and morning, he offers two oblations in the evening, and two in the morning--that makes four oblations: thus--the horse being four-footed--an oblation is offered for each of its feet.
2	5	3	As to this, they say, 'On the starting off of the horse he performs an offering ; for the moon, doubtless, is the same as King Soma, the food of the gods: when, during that night (of new moon), he does not appear either in the east or in the west, then he comes to this world, and starts for this world .
2	5	4	Now, when he performs the New-moon sacrifice, he thereby performs the (same) offering (as) on the starting of that (horse), and when he performs the Full-moon sacrifice he slaughters the sacrificial horse itself, and, having slaughtered it, he presents it to the gods. The other (real) horse-sacrifice they indeed perform (only) a year after (the starting offering), but this month (of the Full and New-moon sacrifice), revolving, makes up a year : thus the sacrificial horse comes to be slaughtered for him year after year.
2	5	5	Verily, then, for him who, knowing this, offers both the Agnihotra and the Full and New-moon sacrifices, they slaughter the sacrificial horse month by month; and month by month the Asvamedha is offered for him, and his Agnihotra and Full and New-moon sacrifices come to pass into the Asvamedha.
2	6	1	The Pranîtâ water, doubtless, is the head of the sacrifice ; and when he leads forward the Pranîtâ water, it is the head of the sacrifice he thereby forms, and he should know that it is that head of his own that is then being formed.
2	6	2	The fuel, indeed, is its breath (of the mouth), for it is by the breath that everything here is kindled (animated) that has breath and moves twinkling with its eyelids: let him know that it is he himself that is that fuel.
2	6	3	The kindling-verses, indeed, are its spine: let him therefore say (to the Hotri.) regarding them, 'Recite for me, making them, as it were, continuous ;' for continuous, as it were, is this spinal column. And the two libations of ghee are its mind and speech, Sarasvat and Sarasvatî : lethim know that the two libations of ghee are his mind and speech, Sarasvat and Sarasvatî.
2	6	4	The five fore-offerings are these its five (outlets of the) vital airs in the head;--the first fore-offering is its mouth, the second the right nostril, the third the left nostril, the fourth the right ear, and the fifth the left ear. And inasmuch as at the fourth fore-offering he pours together (the ghee ), therefore this ear is, on the inner side, connected by a channel (with the other). The two butter-portions are the eyes: let him know that these are his own eyes.
2	6	5	And that cake which is offered to Agni is its right flank; and the low-voiced offering is its heart; and inasmuch as they perform this in a low voice, this heart is, as it were, in secret.
2	6	6	And that cake which is offered to Agni and Soma (at full moon), or Indra's Sânnâyya (at new moon), is its left flank; the Svishtakrit is that part between its shoulders; and the (Brahman's) fore-portion  is the poison .
2	6	7	And when he cuts off the fore-portion,---even as there they cut out what was injured  in Pragâpati, so do they now thereby cut out what in this (body) is clogged and hardened, and affected by Varunalet him know that, as there they cut out what was injured in Pragâpati, so they now cut out what in him is clogged and hardened and affected by Varuna.
2	6	8	The Idâ, indeed, is the belly: even as there, at (the invocation of) the Idâ  they cut off portions (and put them) together, so now food, of all kinds is put together in the belly.
2	6	9	The three after-offerings are these its three downward breathings; and the Sûktavâka and Samyorvâka its arms (or fore-feet); the four Patnîsamyâgas the four supports--the two thighs and the two knee-bones; and the Samishtayagus is the two (hind) feet.
2	6	10	These are twenty-one offerings;--two libations of ghee, five fore-offerings, two butter-portions, and Agni's cake: this makes ten; Agni and Soma's low-voiced offering, Agni and Soma's cake, the Agni Svishtakrit, the Idâ, three after-offerings, the Sûktavâka, the Samyorvâka, further his seizing (the two spoons) at the same time there at the Patnîsamyâgas  and (last) the Samishtayagus.
2	6	11	These are twenty-one offerings,--there are twelve months and five seasons in a year; and three worlds--that makes twenty; and yonder burning (sun) is the twenty-first--that is the goal , that the resting-place: he thus reaches that goal, that resting-place.
2	6	12	Now, as to this Âruni said, 'Every half-month, indeed, I become a sharer of the same world with yonder sun: that is the perfection of the Full and New-moon sacrifices which I know.'
2	6	13	As to this they ask, 'Who is the better one, the self-offerer, or the god-offerer?' Let him say, 'The self-offerer;' for a self-offerer, doubtless, is he who knows, 'This my (new) body is formed by that (body of Yagña, the sacrifice), this my (new) body is procured  thereby.' And even as a snake frees itself from its skin, so does he free himself from his mortal body, from sin; and made up of the Rik, the Yagus, the Sâman, and of offerings, does he pass on to the heavenly world.
2	6	14	And a god-offerer, doubtless, is he who knows, 'I am now offering sacrifice to the gods, I am serving the gods,'--such a one is like an inferior who brings tribute to his superior, or like a man of the people who brings tribute to the king: verily, he does not win such a place (in heaven) as the other.
2	7	1	The Sacrifice is the Year; and, verily, sacrifice is offered at the end of the year of him whoso knows that the sacrifice is the year; and all that is done in the year comes to be gained, secured, and won for him.
2	7	2	The officiating priests are the seasons; and, verily, sacrifice is offered at the end of the seasons of him whoso knows that the officiating priests are the seasons; and all that is done in the seasons comes to be gained, secured, and won for him.
2	7	3	The oblations are the months; and, verily, sacrifice is offered at the end of the months of him whoso knows that the oblations are the months;and all that is done in the months comes to be gained, secured, and won for him.
2	7	4	The oblation-vessels are the half-months; and, verily, sacrifice is offered at the end of the half-months of him whoso knows that the oblation-vessels are the half-months; and all that is done in the half-months comes to be gained, secured, and won for him.
2	7	5	The two attendants  are the day and night; and, verily, sacrifice is offered at the end of the day and night of him whoso knows that the two attendants are the day and night; and all that is done in the day and night comes to be gained, secured, and won for him.
2	7	6	The first kindling-verse is this (earth), the second the fire, the third the wind, the fourth the air, the fifth the sky, the sixth the sun, the seventh the moon, the eighth the mind, the ninth speech, the tenth fervid devotion, and the eleventh the Brahman; for it is these that kindle all this (universe), and by them all this (universe) is kindled, whence they are called kindling-verses.
2	7	7	Thrice he recites the first (kindling-verse): by reciting it the first time he gains the eastern region, by the second time he gains the southern region, and by the third time he gains the upper region.
2	7	8	And thrice he recites the last (verse): by reciting it the first time he gains the western region, by the second time he gains the northern region, by the third time he gains this same (earth as a) resting-place;and by those (kindling-verses) he thus gains these worlds, and these regions.
2	7	9	The first libation of ghee is the sacred law, and the second the truth; and, verily, he secures for himself law and truth, and whatsoever is to be gained by law and truth all that he now gains.
2	7	10	The first fore-offering is brilliance, the second honour, the third fame, the fourth holy lustre, the fifth food (prosperity).
2	7	11	After the first fore-offering let him utter (the anumantrana ), 'May I become brilliant;' after the second, 'May I become honoured; after the third, 'May I become glorious;' after the fourth, 'May I become endowed with holy lustre;' after the fifth, 'May I become prosperous;'--and, verily, whosoever knows this becomes brilliant, and honoured, and glorious, and endowed with holy lustre, and prosperous.
2	7	12	Now, Svetaketu Âruneya , who knew this, said once, 'To him who will thus know that glory of the fore-offerings, people will in days to come be flocking from all sides as if wishing to see some great serpent.'
2	7	13	The first butter-portion, doubtless, is the past, and the second the future: verily, he secures for himself both the past and the future; and whatever is to be gained by the past and the future, all that he now gains.
2	7	14	The cake offered to Agni is the Brahman (priesthood); and, verily, whosoever knows Agni's cake to be the priesthood secures for himself the priesthood; and whatever is to be gained by the priesthood all that he now gains.
2	7	15	The low-voiced offering is the Kshatra (nobility); and, verily, whosoever knows the low-voiced offering to be the nobility secures for himself the nobility; and whatever is to be gained by the nobility all that he now gains. And inasmuch as some perform the low-voiced offering, and others do not. therefore people speak (give information) to the noble both in a loud voice and in a low voice.
2	7	16	The second cake is the Vis (people); and, verily, whosoever knows the second cake to be the people secures for himself the people; and whatever is to be gained by the people all that he gains. And inasmuch as Agni's cake and the low-voiced offering come first therefore the priesthood and nobility are established upon the people.
2	7	17	The Sânnâyya  is royal dignity; and, verily, whosoever knows the Sânnâyya to be royal dignity secures for himself royal dignity; and whatever is to be gained by royal dignity all that he gains. And inasmuch as some pour (sweet and sour milk) together , and others do not, therefore the royal dignity both (combines) together and (keeps) asunder .
2	7	18	The Svishtakrit is fervid devotion; and, verily, whosoever knows the Svishtakrit to be fervid devotionsecures for himself fervid devotion; and whatever is to be gained by fervid devotion all that he now gains.
2	7	19	The fore-portion is the place (in heaven); and, verily, whosoever knows the fore-portion to be the place (in heaven) secures for himself the place (in heaven); and whatever is to be gained by the place (in heaven) all that he now gains; and, indeed, he does not by ever so little fall from his place, for it is by ever so little that in yonder world men fall from their place; and whosoever knows this does not fall from his place however much evil he may have done.
2	7	20	The Idâ is faith; and, verily, whosoever knows the Idâ to be faith secures for himself faith, and whatever is to be gained by faith all that he now gains.
2	7	21	The first after-offering is the thunderbolt, the second the hail-stone, the third the (heavenly) firebrand (meteor).
2	7	22	After the first after-offering let him utter (the anumantrana), 'O thunderbolt, smite N.N.!' (naming) him whom he hates; after the second, O hail-stone, smite N.N.!' after the third, 'O firebrand, smite N.N.!'
2	7	23	And if such a one dies suddenly, then, indeed, it is that after-offering, the thunderbolt, that smites him; and if he is, as it were, covered with out-flowing (blood), then it is that after-offering, the hail-stone, that smites him; and if he is, as it were, covered with scorching, then it is that after-offering, the (heavenly) firebrand, that smites him.
2	7	24	Such is the bolt of the sacrifice: it was by that bolt, indeed, that the gods overcame the Asuras;and in like manner does the Sacrificer who knows this overcome his wicked, spiteful enemy.
2	7	25	And if the sacrifice were to end with after-offerings, then it would end with the thunderbolt, the hail-stone, and the (heavenly) firebrand: therefore the sacrifice of the gods ends either with the Idâ or with the Samyos.
2	7	26	By the fore-offerings, indeed, the gods reached the world of heaven. The Asuras tried to get thither after them; and by the after-offerings they (the gods) drove them back: thus, when the after-offerings are performed, the Sacrificer drives back his wicked, spiteful enemy.
2	7	27	The fore-offerings, indeed, are the out-breathings , and the after-offerings the off-breathings wherefore the fore-offerings are poured out in a forward direction , for that is the form of the out-breathing; and the after-offerings (are poured out) in a backward direction , for that is the form of the off-breathing. The after-offerings, indeed, are the Upasads  of the Full and New-moon sacrifices, whence they are performed in a backward direction after the manner of the Upasads.
2	7	28	The Sûktavâka is the completion; and, verily, whosoever knows the Sûktavâka to be the completion secures for himself the completion; and whatever is to be gained by the completion all that he now gains: he obtains the completion of his (full) lifetime.
2	7	29	The Samyorvâka is the resting-place; and, verily, whosoever knows the Samyuvâka to be the resting-place secures for himself a resting-place; and whatever is to be gained by a resting-place all that he now gains: he reaches a resting-place.
2	7	30	The gods fortified the Patnîsamyâgas by a mound from behind , and placed a couple thereon for the sake of procreation: thus when the Patnîsamyâgas are performed, he places a couple thereon for the sake of procreation; for, indeed, after the procreation of the gods offspring is produced, and offspring is produced by pair after pair (of men and beasts) for him who knows this.
2	7	31	The Samishtayagus is food; and, verily, whosoever knows the Samishtayagus to be food secures for himself food; and whatever is to be gained by food all that he now gains.
2	7	32	The Sacrificer is the Year; and the Seasons officiate for him. The Âgnîdhra is the Spring,whence forest-fires take place in spring, for that is a form of Agni. The Adhvaryu is the Summer, for summer is, as it were, scorched; and the Adhvaryu comes forth (from the sacrificial ground) like something scorched . The Udgâtri is the Rainy season; whence, when it rains hard, a sound as that of a chant is produced. 'The Brahman is the Autumn; whence, when the corn ripens, they say, 'The creatures are rich in growth (brahmanvat).' The Hotri is the Winter, whence in winter cattle waste away, having the Vashat uttered over them. These, then, are the divinities that officiate for him; and even if Aishâvîrâh  were to officiate for him, let him think in his mind of those divinities, and those deities, indeed, officiate for him.
2	7	33	Now, as to that balance, the right (south) edge of the Vedi . Whatever good deed man does that is inside the Vedi; and whatever evil deed he does that is outside the Vedi. Let him therefore sit down, touching the right edge of the Vedi; for, indeed, they place him on the balance in yonder world; and whichever of the two will rise  that he will follow, whether it be the good or the evil. And, verily, whosoever knows this, mounts the balance even in this world, and escapes being placed on the balance in yonder world; for his good deed rises, and not his evil deed.
3	1	1	Verily, the Agnihotrî cow is the speech of the Agnihotra, and her calf is its mind. Now these two, mind and speech, whilst being one and the same, are, as it were, distinct from each other: therefore they tie up the calf and its mother with one and the same rope; and the fire , indeed, is faith, and the ghee truth.
3	1	2	Now, as to this Ganaka of Videha once asked Yâgñavalkya, 'Knowest thou the Agnihotra, Yâgñavalkya?'--'I know it, O king,' he said.--'What is it?'--'Milk, indeed.'
3	1	3	'If there were no milk, wherewith wouldst thou sacrifice?'--'With rice and barley.'--'If there were no rice and barley, wherewith wouldst thou sacrifice?'--'With what other herbs there are.'--'If there were no other herbs, wherewith wouldst thou sacrifice?'--'With what forest herbs there are.'--'If there were no forest herbs, wherewith wouldst thou sacrifice?'--'With fruit of trees.'--'If there were no fruit of trees, wherewith wouldst thou sacrifice?'--'With water.'--'If there were no water, wherewith wouldst thou sacrifice?'
3	1	4	He spake, 'Then, indeed, there would be nothing whatsoever here, and yet there would be offered--the truth in faith.'--'Thou knowest the Agnihotra, Yâgñavalkya: I give thee a hundred cows,' said Ganaka.
3	1	5	Concerning this point there are also theseverses:--'Knowing what , does the offerer of the Agnihotra stay away from his house? how is his wisdom (manifested) ? how is he kept up by his fires ?'--whereby he means to say, 'How, then, is there no staying away from home on his part ?'
3	1	6	'He who is the swiftest in the worlds , that wise one is found staying abroad: thus (is manifested) his wisdom, thus he is kept up by his fires;'--he thereby means the mind: it is owing to his mind that there is no staying away from home on his part.
3	1	7	'When, having gone far away, he heedeth not there his duty, wherein is that offering of his offered; (and wherein) do they, at his house, perform the offering of the progress?'--that is to say,--'When, having gone far away, he there heeds not his duty, wherein does that offering of his come to be offered?'
3	1	8	'He who waketh in the worlds and sustaineth all beings, in him that offering of his is offered, (and in him) do they, at his house, perform the offeringof the progress;'--he thereby means the breath; whence they say, 'The Agnihotra is breath.'
5	1	1	Verily, whosoever knows the six pairs in the Agnihotra, has offspring born to him by pair after pair, by all generations. The Sacrificer and his wife--this is one pair: through it his Agnihotra would be possessed of a wife,--'May I obtain this pair!' he thinks . The calf and the Agnihotra-cow--this is another pair: through it his Agnihotra-cow would become possessed of a male calf,--'May I obtain this pair!' he thinks. The pot and the coals--this is another pair; the offering-spoon and the dipping-spoon--this is another pair; the Âhavanîya fire and the log--this is another pair; the libation and the Svâhâ-call--this is another pair: these, doubtless, are the six pairs in the Agnihotra; and he who thus knows them, has offspring born to him by pair after pair, by all generations.
5	3	1	The Brahman delivered the creatures over to Death, the Brahmakârin (religious student) alone it did not deliver over to him. He (Death) said, 'Let me have a share in this one also.'--'Only the night on which he shall not bring his  fire-wood,' said (the Brahman). On whatever night, therefore, the Brahmakârin does not bring fire-wood, that (night) he passes  cutting it off from his own life: therefore the Brahmakârin should bring fire-wood, lest he should pass (his nights) cutting off (as much) from his life.
5	3	2	He who enters on a Brahmakârin's life, indeed, enters on a long sacrificial session: the log he puts on the fire in entering thereon is the opening (offering), and that which (he puts on the fire) when he is about to bathe  is the concluding (offering); and what (logs) there are between these, are just his (logs) of the sacrificial session. When a Brâhmana enters on a Brahmakârin's life--
5	3	3	He enters beings in four parts: with one fourth part (he enters) the fire, with another part death, with another part his religious teacher; and his fourth part remains in his own self.
5	3	4	Now, when he brings a log for the fire, he redeems that fourth part of his which is in the fire; and having cleansed  it, he takes it to his own self, and it enters him.
5	3	5	And when, having made himself poor, as it were, and become devoid of shame, he begs alms, then he redeems that part of his which is in death;and, having cleansed it, he takes it to himself, and it enters him.
5	3	6	And when he does the teacher's bidding, and when he does any work for the teacher, he redeems that part of his which is in the teacher; and, having cleansed it, he takes it to himself, and it enters him.
5	3	7	Let him not beg alms after he has bathed (at the end of his studentship), for by bathing he drives off beggary, and drives off hunger from his kinsmen and his deceased ancestors, 'Let him who knows this beg alms only from her in whom he has the greatest confidence ,' they say, 'for that makes for heaven.' And should he find no other woman from whom alms could be begged, he may even beg from his own teacher's wife, and thereafter from his own mother . The seventh (night) should not pass by for him without begging: him who knows this and practises this all the Vedas enter; for, verily, even as the fire shines when kindled, so does he, after bathing, shine, who, knowing this, lives a Brahmakârin's life.
4	1	1	Now Uddâlaka Âruni  was driving about , as a chosen (offering-priest), amongst the people ofthe northern country. By him a gold coin was offered; for in the time of our forefathers a prize used to be offered by chosen (priests) when driving about, for the sake of calling out the timid  to a disputation. Fear then seized the Brâhmanas of the northern people:--
4	1	2	'This fellow is a Kurupañkâla Brahman, and son of a Brahman--let us take care lest he should deprive us of our domain: come, let us challenge him to a disputation on spiritual matters.'--'With whom for our champion?'--'With Svaidâyana.' Svaidâyana, to wit, was Saunaka.
4	1	3	They said, 'Svaidâyana, with thee as our champion we will fight this fellow.' He said, 'Well, then, stay ye here quietly: I will just make his acquaintance .' He went up to him, and when he had come up, he (Uddâlaka) greeted him saying, 'Svaidâyana!'--'Halloo, son of Gautama!' replied the other, and straightway, began to question him.
4	1	4	'He alone, O son of Gautama, may drive about amongst people as chosen (offering-priest), who knows in the Full and New-moon sacrifices eight butter-portions (offered) previously, five portions of sacrificial food in the middle, six (portions) of Pragâpati, and eight butter-portions (offered) subsequently.
4	1	5	'He alone, O son of Gautama, may drive about amongst people as chosen (priest), who knows from the Full and New-moon sacrifices  whereby it is that creatures here are born toothless, whereby they (the teeth) grow with them, whereby they decay with them, whereby they come to remain permanently with them; whereby, in the last stage of life, they all decay again with them; whereby the lower ones grow first, then the upper ones; whereby the lower ones are smaller, and the upper ones broader; whereby the incisors are larger, and whereby the molars are of equal size.
4	1	6	'He alone, O son of Gautama, may drive about amongst people as chosen (priest), who knows from the Full and New-moon sacrifices, whereby creatures here are born with hair; whereby, for the second time, as it were, the hair of the beard and the arm-pits and other parts of the body  grow on them; whereby it is on the head that one firstbecomes grey, and then, again, in the last stage of life, one becomes grey all over.
4	1	7	'He alone, O son of Gautama, may drive about amongst people as chosen (priest), who knows from the Full and New-moon sacrifices whereby the seed of the boy is not productive, whereby in his middle age it is productive, and whereby again in his last stage of life it is not productive;--
4	1	8	'And he who knows the golden, brilliant-winged Gâyatrî who bears the Sacrificer to the heavenly world.' Then he (Uddâlaka) gave up to him the gold coin, saying, 'Thou art learned, Svaidâyana; and, verily, gold is given unto him who knows gold;' and he (Svaidâyana), having concealed it , went away. They asked him, 'How did that son of Gautama behave?'
4	1	9	He said, 'Even as a Brahman, and the son of a Brahman: the head would fly off of whosoever should (dare to) challenge him to a disputation .' They then went away in all directions. He (Uddâlaka) then came back to him, with fire-woodin his hand , and said, 'I want to become thy pupil.'--'What wouldst thou study?'--'Even those questions which thou didst ask me--explain them to me!' He said, 'I will tell them to thee even without thy becoming my pupil.'
4	1	10	And he then spoke thus to him:--The two libations of ghee, the five fore-offerings, and, eighth, Agni's butter-portion--these are the eight butter-portions (offered) previously. Soma's butter-portion, being the first of the portions of sacrificial food--for Soma is sacrificial food,---Agni's cake, Agni-Soma's low-voiced offering, Agni-Soma's cake, and (the offering to) Agni Svishtakrit--these are the five portions of sacrificial food in the middle.
4	1	11	The fore-portion, the Idâ, what he hands to the Agnîdh , the Brahman's portion, the Sacrificer's portion, and the Anvâhârya (mess of rice)--these are the six (portions) of Pragâpati. The three after-offerings, the four Patnîsamyâgas, and, eighth, the Samishtayagus--these are the eight butter-portions (offered) subsequently.
4	1	12	And inasmuch as the fore-offerings are without invitatory formulas , therefore creatures are horn here without teeth; and inasmuch as the chief oblations have invitatory formulas, therefore they (the teeth) grow in them; and inasmuch as the after-offerings are without invitatory formulas, therefore they (the teeth) decay in them; and inasmuch as the Patnîsamyâgas as have invitatory formulas,therefore they (the teeth) come to remain permanently with them; and inasmuch as the Samishtayagus is without invitatory formula, therefore they all decay again in the last stage of life.
4	1	13	And inasmuch as, after uttering the invitatory formula, he offers with the offering-formula, therefore the lower (teeth) grow first, then the upper ones; and inasmuch as, after uttering a gâyatrî verse as invitatory formula, he offers with a trishtubh verse , therefore the lower (teeth) are smaller, and the upper ones broader; and inasmuch as he pours out the two libations of ghee in a forward direction , therefore the incisors are larger; and inasmuch as the two samyâgyâs  are in the same metre, therefore the molars are of equal size.
4	1	14	And inasmuch as he spreads a cover of sacrificial grass (on the Vedi), therefore creatures here are born with hair; and inasmuch as he for the second time, as it were, spreads the Prastara-bunch , therefore, for the second time, as it were, the hair of the beard and the arm-pits, and other parts of the body grow; and inasmuch as at first he only throws the Prastara-bunch after (the oblations into the fire), therefore it is on the head that one first becomes grey; and inasmuch as he then throws after it all the sacrificial grass of the altar-ground, therefore,in the last stage of life, one again becomes grey all over.
4	1	15	And inasmuch as the fore-offerings have ghee for their offering-material, a boy's seed is not productive, but is like water, for ghee is like water; and inasmuch as, in the middle of the sacrifice, they sacrifice with sour curds  and with cake, therefore it is productive in his middle stage of life, for thick-flowing, as it were, is (that havis), and thick-flowing, as it were, is seed; and inasmuch as the after-offerings have ghee for their offering-material, it again is not productive in his last stage of life, and is like water, for ghee, indeed, is like water.
4	1	16	The Vedi (altar-ground), doubtless, is the Gâyatrî: the eight butter-portions (offered) previously are her right wing, and the eight butter-portions (offered) subsequently are her left wing: that same golden, brilliant-winged Gâyatrî, indeed, bears the Sacrificer who knows this to the heavenly world.
4	2	1	Now, then, as to the taking up of the two offering-spoons . Now, in this respect, some people,thinking themselves clever, take up the (guhû) with the right, and the upabhrit with the left (hand); but let him not do so; for if, in that case, any one were to say of him, 'Surely, this Adhvaryu has made the Sacrificer's spiteful enemy equal to him, and able to cope with him,' then that would indeed be likely to come to pass.
4	2	2	Let him rather do it in this way;--having taken the guhû with both hands, let him lay it down on the upabhrit; there is no question about this: it is good for (securing) cattle and life. Let him take them up without clinking them together,--were he to let them clink together, insecurity of property would befall the Sacrificer: let him, therefore, take them up without clinking them together.
4	2	3	Now as to the stepping past (the Vedi). By a thunderbolt, indeed, one, Adhvaryu scatters the Sacrificer's cattle, and by a thunderbolt another drives them together for him. Now that Adhvaryu, doubtless, scatters the Sacrificer's cattle by a thunderbolt, who steps past with his right (foot)  when he isabout to call (on the Âgnîdhra) for the Sraushat, and with his left (foot) when he has called for the Sraushat; and that (other) one drives them together for him who steps past with his left (foot) When he is about to call for the Sraushat, and with his right (foot) when he has called for the Sraushat; for he does indeed drive them together for him.
4	2	4	Now as to the holding (of the spoons). In this respect, some people, thinking themselves clever, hold the two spoons whilst stretching forward both arms; but let him not do so, for if, in that case, any one were to say of him, 'Surely, this Sacrificer has made two spears of his arms: he will become a spear-holder,' then that would indeed be likely to come to pass. But that (navel is the channel of the) central breathing: let him therefore hold (the spoon) by lowering them  to that (breathing).
4	2	5	Now as to calling for the Sraushat : there are six (modes of) calling for the Sraushat,--the descending, the level, the ascending, the feeble, the outward-tending, and the inward-tending.
4	2	6	Now the descending mode, indeed, it is when he begins in a high tone and concludes in a low tone: whoever should wish that any one  should be poorer,let him begin for him in a high tone and conclude in a low tone; and he will thereby become poorer.
4	2	7	And the level one, indeed, it is when he concludes in the same tone in which he has begun: whoever should wish that any one should be neither more prosperous nor poorer, let him conclude for him in the same tone in which he has begun; and he will thereby become neither more prosperous nor poorer.
4	2	8	And the ascending one, indeed, it is when he begins in a low tone and concludes in a high tone: whoever should wish that any one should be more prosperous, let him begin for him in a low tone and conclude in a high tone; and he will thereby become more prosperous.
4	2	9	And the feeble one, indeed, it is when he calls for the Sraushat in a thin, long-drawn, toneless way: if, in that case, any one were to say of him, 'Surely, this Adhvaryu has made the Sacrificer feeble, and submissive to his spiteful enemy,' then that would indeed be likely to cone to pass.
4	2	10	And the outward-tending (bahih-sri) one, indeed, it is when he opens his lips wide and utters his call at a high, toneless pitch: tone being prosperity, he thereby puts prosperity (srî) outside (bahis) himself, and becomes hungry (poor).
4	2	11	And the inward-tending (antah-sri) one, indeed, it is when he closes his lips, and utters his call at a loud, toneful pitch: tone being prosperity, he thereby puts prosperity (srî) inside (antah) himself, and becomes an eater of food (rich).
4	2	12	Having kept back (the tone) deep in the breast, as it were, let him (keep up the middle pitch of) the Brihat (sâman) in both (words 'om srâvaya'), and finally leave off at a high pitch; there is no question about this: it is good for (securing) cattle and life.
4	2	13	Now as to the oblation. In this respect, some people, thinking themselves clever, having turned down the spoon eastwards, and poured out the oblation, turn it round and place it over the upabhrit. But let him not do this; for if, in that case, any one were to say of him, 'Surely, this Adhvaryu has made the Sacrificer dependent on, and submissive to, his spiteful enemy,' then that would indeed be likely to come to pass.
4	2	14	And some, having turned down the spoon sideways, and poured out the oblation, turn it round and place it over the upabhrit. But let him not do so; for if, in that case, any one were to say of him, 'Surely, this Advaryu has stopped the oblations by (following) the wrong way, he (the Sacrificer) will either be shattered, or become worm-eaten,' then that would indeed be likely to come to pass.
4	2	15	Let him rather do it in this way:--having turned down the spoon eastwards, and poured out the oblation, let him carry it up in the same way and place it over the upabhrit;--there is no question about this: it is good for (securing) cattle and life.
4	2	16	One Adhvaryu, indeed, burns the oblations, and another satisfies the oblations; and that Adhvaryu, assuredly, burns the oblations who, having offered ghee, offers portions (of sacrificial dishes): indeed, it is with reference to him that an invisible voice has said, 'Surely, this Adhvaryu burns the oblations.' And he, indeed, satisfies them whohaving offered ghee, offers sacrificial portions, and finally again offers ghee thereon: such a one certainly satisfies them; and, these (oblations) having been satisfied, the gods fill gold cups (for him) .
4	2	17	Concerning this, Yâgñavalkya said , 'When, after making an underlayer (of ghee), and cutting portions (from the sacrificial dish), he bastes them (with ghee), then, indeed, he satisfies them; and, they being satisfied, the gods fill (for him) gold cups .' Now Saulvâyana was Adhvaryu to those who had Ayasthûna  for their Grihapati .
4	2	18	He said, 'Surely, this sacrificial session is supplied with lean cattle and scanty ghee; and yet this one, forsooth, thinks himself a Grihapati!'
4	2	19	He (Ayasthûna) said, 'Adhvaryu, thou hast insulted us; and there now are those two spoons which, for a whole year, thou hast not been able to take up (in the proper manner): if I were to instruct thee in (the use of) them, thou wouldst become multiplied in offspring and cattle, and wouldst lead (the Sacrificer) to heaven.'
4	2	20	He said, 'Let me become thy pupil.' He answered, 'Even now, indeed, art thou worthy (of being instructed), who hast been our Adhvaryu for a year: I will teach thee this even without thybecoming my pupil.' And so, indeed, he taught him that taking up of the two spoons as we have here explained it: hence one ought only to make one who knows this his Adhvaryu, and not one who does not know it.
4	3	1	Pragâpati was becoming heated (by fervid devotion), whilst creating living beings . From him, worn out and heated, Srî (Fortune and Beauty) came forth. She stood there resplendent, shining, and trembling . The gods, beholding her thus resplendent, shining, and trembling, set their minds upon her.
4	3	2	They said to Pragâpati, 'Let us kill her and take (all) this from her.' He said, 'Surely, that Srî is a woman, and people do not kill a woman, but rather take (anything) from her (leaving her) alive.'
4	3	3	Agni then took her food, Soma her royal power, Varuna her universal sovereignty, Mitra her noble rank, Indra her power, Brihaspati her holy lustre, Savitri her dominion, Pûshan her wealth, Sarasvatî her prosperity, and Tvashtri her beautiful forms.
4	3	4	She said to Pragâpati, 'Surely, they have taken (all) this from me!' He said, 'Do thou ask it back from them by sacrifice!'
4	3	5	She perceived this offering with ten sacrificial dishes--a cake on eight potsherds for Agni, a pap for Soma, a cake on ten potsherds for Varuna, a pap for Mitra, a cake on eleven potsherds for Indra, a pap for Brihaspati, a cake on twelve or eight potsherds for Savitri, a pap for Pûshan, a pap for Sarasvatî, and a cake on ten potsherds for Tvashtri.
4	3	6	She invited them by means of this invitatory formula,--'May Agni, Soma, Varuna, Mitra, Indra, Brihaspati, and the thousandfold-bestowing Savitri,--May Pûshan, for our Sacrifices, unite us with cattle, Sarasvatî with favour, Tvashtri with beautiful forms!' They accordingly made their appearance again.
4	3	7	By this offering-formula she then approached them in inverted order (beginning) from the last:--'May Tvashtri grant me forms, and the bountiful Sarasvatî, and Pûshan good fortune, and may Savitri bestow gifts on me, and Indra power, and Mitra noble rank, and Varuna, and Soma and Agni!' They were ready to restore them to her.
4	3	8	She perceived these additional oblations:--'May Agni, the food-eater, the food-lord, bestow food upon me at this sacrifice, svâhâ!' Agni, taking the oblation, departed and restored her food to her.
4	3	9	'May Soma, the king, the lord of kings, bestow royal power upon me at this sacrifice, svâhâ!' Soma, taking the oblation, departed and restored her royal power to her.
4	3	10	'May Varuna, the universal sovereign, the lord of universal sovereigns, bestow universal sovereignty upon me at this sacrifice,svâhâ!' Varuna, taking the oblation, departed and restored her universal sovereignty to her.
4	3	11	'May Mitra, the Kshatra (nobility), the lord of the Kshatra, bestow noble rank upon me at this sacrifice, svâhâ!' Mitra, taking the oblation, departed and restored her noble rank to her.
4	3	12	'May Indra, the power, the lord of power, bestow power upon me at this sacrifice, svâhâ!' Indra, taking the oblation, departed and restored her power to her.
4	3	13	'May Brihaspati, the Brahman (priesthood), the lord of the Brahman, bestow holy lustre upon me at this sacrifice, svâhâ!' Brihaspati, taking the oblation, departed and restored her holy lustre to her.
4	3	14	'May Savitri, the kingdom, the lord of the kingdom, bestow the kingdom upon me at this sacrifice, svâhâ!' Savitri, taking the oblation, departed and restored her kingdom to her.
4	3	15	'May Pûshan, wealth, the lord of wealth, bestow wealth upon me at this sacrifice, svâhâ!' Pûshan, taking the oblation, departed and restored her wealth to her.
4	3	16	'May Sarasvatî, prosperity , the lord of prosperity, bestow prosperity upon me at this sacrifice, svâhâ!' Sarasvatî, taking the oblation, departed and restored her prosperity to her.
4	3	17	'May Tvashtri, the fashioner of forms,the lord of forms, bestow cattle with form  upon me at this sacrifice, svâhâ!' Tvashtri, taking the oblation, departed and restored her cattle with (beautiful) form to her.
4	3	18	These, then, are ten deities, ten sacrificial dishes, . ten offerings, ten presents to priests,--the Virâg consists of decad after decad (of syllables), and the Virâg (shining one) is Srî (beauty, prosperity): he thus establishes (the Sacrificer) in the Virâg, in prosperity and food.
4	3	19	For this (sacrifice) there are fifteen kindling-verses : he offers to the deities in a low voice . There are five fore-offerings, three after-offerings, and one Samishtayagus. The (formulas of the) two butter-portions contain the word 'affluence':--, 'Through Agni may he obtain wealth and affluence day by day, famous and abounding in heroes;'--, 'An increaser of the house, a remover of trouble, a procurer of wealth, an augmenter of affluence, a kind friend he thou unto us, O Soma!' The two formulas of the Svishtakrit contain the word 'thousand':--, 'Grant thou unto us wealth, a thousandfold, with offspring and affluence, and glorious manhood, O Agni, most excellent and neverfailing!'--, 'Favour thou our prayer, as the best invoker of the gods for our hymns: blaze up auspiciously for us, wind-fanned, O Agni, the dispenser of a thousand bounties!'
4	3	20	Now, indeed, it was Gotama Râhûgana who discovered this (sacrifice). It went away to Ganaka of Videha, and he searched for it in the Brâhmanas versed in the Aṅgas  (limbs of the Veda), and found it in Yâgñavalkya. He said, 'A thousand we give thee, O Yâgñavalkya, in whom we have found that Mitravindâ.' He finds (vind) Mitra, and his is the kingdom, he conquers recurring death  and gains all life, whosoever, knowing this, performs this sacrifice; or whosoever thus knows it.
4	4	1	Now, as to the successful issue of the sacrificial food. Now, indeed, there are six doors to the Brahman --to wit, fire, wind, the waters, the moon, lightning, and the sun.
4	4	2	He who offers with slightly burnt sacrificial food, enters through the fire-door  of the Brahman;and, by entering through the fire-door of the Brahman, he wins his union with, and participation in the world of, the Brahman.
4	4	3	And he who offers with sacrificial food that has fallen (on the ground) enters through the wind-door of the Brahman; and, by entering through the wind-door of the Brahman, he wins his union with, and participation in the world of, the Brahman.
4	4	4	And he who offers with uncooked sacrificial food, enters through the water-door of the Brahman; and, by entering through the water-door of the Brahman, he wins his union with, and participation in the world of, the Brahman.
4	4	5	And he who offers with slightly browned sacrificial food, enters through the moon-door of the Brahman, and, by entering through the moon-door of the Brahman, he wins his union with, and participation in the world of, the Brahman.
4	4	6	And he who offers with browned sacrificial food, enters through the lightning-door of the Brahman, and, by entering through the lightning-door of the Brahman, he wins his union with, and participation in the world of, the Brahman.
4	4	7	And he who offers with well-cooked sacrificial food, enters through the sun-door of the Brahman; and, by entering through the sun-door of the Brahman, he wins his union with, and participation in the world of, the Brahman. This, then, is the successful issue of the sacrificial food, and, verily, whosoever thus knows this to be the successful issue of the sacrificial food, by him offering is made with wholly successful sacrificial food.
4	4	8	Then, as to the successful issue of the sacrifice. Now, whatever part of the sacrifice is incomplete (nyûna) that part of it is productive for him ; and what is redundant in it that is favourable to cattle; and what is broken (disconnected)  in it that makes for prosperity; and what is perfect in it that is conducive to heaven.
4	4	9	And if he think, 'There has been that which was incomplete in my sacrifice,' let him believe, 'That is productive for me: I shall have offspring produced (in men and cattle).'
4	4	10	And if he think, 'There has been that which was redundant in my sacrifice,' let him believe, 'That is favourable to cattle for me: I shall become possessed of cattle.'
4	4	11	And if he think, 'There has been that which was disconnected in my sacrifice,' let him believe, 'That makes for my prosperity: Prosperity, surrounded by splendour, fame and holy lustre, will accrue to me.'
4	4	12	And if he think, 'There has been that which was perfect in my sacrifice,' let him believe, 'That is conducive to heaven for me: I shall become one of those in the heavenly world.' This then is the successful issue of the sacrifice; and, verily, whosoever thus knows this to be the successful issue of the sacrifice, by him offering is made by a wholly successful sacrifice.
5	1	1	The nymph Urvasî loved Purûravas , the son of Idâ. When she wedded him, she said, 'Thrice a day shalt thou embrace  me; but do not lie with me against my will , and let me not see thee naked, for such is the way to behave to us women.'
5	1	2	She then dwelt with him a long time, and was even with child of him, so long did she dwell with him. Then the Gandharvas  said to one another, 'For a long time, indeed, has this Urvasî dwelt among men: devise ye some means how she may come back to us.' Now, a ewe with two lambs was tied to her couch: the Gandharvas then carried off one of the lambs.
5	1	3	'Alas,' she cried, 'they are taking away my darling , as if I were where there is no hero and no man!' They carried off the second, and she spake in the selfsame manner.
5	1	4	He then thought within himself, 'How can that be (a place) without a hero and without a man where I am?' And naked, as he was, he sprangup after them: too long he deemed it that he should put on his garment. Then the Gandharvas produced a flash of lightning, and she beheld him naked even as by daylight. Then, indeed, she vanished: 'Here I am back,' he said, and lo! she had vanished . Wailing with sorrow he wandered all over Kurukshetra. Now there is a lotus-lake there, called Anyatahplakshâ: He walked along its bank; and there nymphs were swimming about in the shape of swans .
5	1	5	And she (Urvasî), recognising him, said, 'This is the man with whom I have dwelt.' They then said, 'Let us appear to him!'--'So be it!' she replied; and they appeared to him .
5	1	6	He then recognised her and implored her , 'Oh, my wife, stay thou, cruel in mind : let us now exchange words! Untold, these secrets of ours will not bring us joy in days tocome;'--'Stop, pray, let us speak together!' this is what he meant to say to her.
5	1	7	She replied , 'What concern have I with speaking to thee? I have passed away like the first of the dawns. Purûravas, go home again: I am like the wind, difficult to catch;'--'Thou didst not do what I had told thee; hard to catch I am for thee, go to thy home again!' this is what she meant to say.
5	1	8	He then said sorrowing , 'Then will thy friend  rush away  this day never to come back, to go to the farthest distance: then will he lie in Nirriti's  lap, or the fierce wolves will devour him; Thy friend will either hang himself, or start forth; or the wolves, or dogs, will devour him!' this is what he meant to say.
5	1	9	She replied , 'Purûravas, do not die! do not rush away! let not the cruel wolves devour thee! Truly, there is no friendship with women, and theirs are the hearts of hyenas ;'-- 'Do not take this to heart! there is no friendship with women: return home!' this is what she meant to say.
5	1	10	, 'When changed in form, I walked among mortals, and passed the nights there during four autumns  ate a little ghee, once a day, and even now I feel satisfied therewith .'--This discourse in fifteen verses has been handed down by the Bahvrikas . Then her heart took pity on him .
5	1	11	She said, 'Come here the last night of the year from now : then shalt thou lie with me for one night, and then this son of thine will have been born.' He came there on the last night of the year, and lo, there stood a golden palace ! They thensaid to him only this (word) , 'Enter!' and then they bade her go to him.
5	1	12	She then said, 'To-morrow morning the Gandharvas will grant thee a boon, and thou must make thy choice.' He said, 'Choose thou for me!'--She replied, 'Say, Let me be one of yourselves!' In the morning the Gandharvas granted him a boon; and he said, 'Let me be one of yourselves!'
5	1	13	They said, 'Surely, there is not among men that holy form of fire by sacrificing wherewith one would become one of ourselves.' They put fire into a pan, and gave it to him saying, 'By sacrificing therewith thou shalt become one of ourselves.' He took it (the fire) and his boy, and went on his way home. He then deposited the fire in the forest, and went to the village with the boy alone.  'Here I am back;' and lo! it had disappeared : what had been the fire was an Asvattha tree (ficus religiosa), and what had been the pan was a Samî tree (mimosa suma). He then returned to the Gandharvas.
5	1	14	They said, 'Cook for a whole year a mess of rice sufficient for four persons; and taking each time three logs from this Asvattha tree, anoint them with ghee, and put them on the fire withverses containing the words "log" and "ghee": the fire which shall result therefrom will be that very fire (which is required).'
5	1	15	They said, 'But that is recondite (esoteric), as it were. Make thyself rather an upper arani  of Asvattha wood, and a lower arani of Sami wood: the fire which shall result therefrom will be that very fire.'
5	1	16	They said, 'But that also is, as it were, recondite. Make thyself rather an upper arani of Asvattha wood, and a lower arani of Asvattha wood: the fire which shall result therefrom will be that very fire.'
5	1	17	He then made himself an upper arani of Asvattha wood, and a lower arani of Asvattha wood; and the fire which resulted therefrom was that very fire: by offering therewith he became one of the Gandharvas. Let him therefore make himself an upper and a lower arani of Asvattha wood, and the fire which results therefrom will be that very fire: by offering therewith he becomes one of the Gandharvas.
5	2	1	By means of the Seasonal sacrifices, Pragâpati fashioned for himself a body. The sacrificial food for the Vaisvadeva  sacrifice he made to be thisright arm of his; the oblation to Agni thereof this thumb; that to Soma this (fore-finger); and that to Savitri this (middle finger).
5	2	2	That cake (to Savitri), doubtless, is the largest, and hence this (middle finger) is the largest of these (fingers). That (oblation) to Sarasvatî is this (third) finger; and that to Pûshan this (little finger). And that (oblation) to the Maruts is this joint above the hand (the wrist); and that to the Visve Devâh is this (elbow ); and that to Heaven and Earth is this arm: this (oblation) is indistinct , whence that limb also is indistinct .
5	2	3	The Varunapraghâsa  offerings are this right leg,--the five oblations which this has in common (with the other Seasonal offerings) are these five toes; and the oblation to Indra and Agni is the knuckles: this (oblation) belongs to two deitieswhence there are these two knuckles. That (oblation) to Varuna is this (shank); that to the Maruts this (thigh); and that (cake) to Ka is this back-bone: this (oblation) is indistinct, whence that (back-bone) is indistinct.
5	2	4	The offering to (Agni) Anîkavat (of the Sâkamedhâh ), doubtless, is his (Pragâpati's) mouth, for the mouth is the extreme end (anîka) of the vital airs; the Sâmtapanîyâ (pap) is the chest, for by the chest one is, as it were, confined  (sam-tap); the Grihamedhîyâ (pap) is the belly--to serve as a foundation, for the belly is a foundation; the Kraidina oblation is the male organ, for it is therewith that (man) sports (krîd), as it were; and the offering to Aditi  is this downward breathing.
5	2	5	The Great Oblation, indeed, is this left leg,--the five oblations which it has in common (with the other Seasonal offerings) are these five toes; and the oblation to Indra and Agni is the knuckles: this (oblation) belongs to two deities whence there arethese two knuckles. The (oblation) to Mahendra is this (shank); that to Visvakarman this (thigh): this (oblation) is indistinct, whence this (thigh) also is indistinct.
5	2	6	The Sunâsîrîya , doubtless, is this left arm,--the five oblations which it has in common (with the other Seasonal offerings) are these five fingers; the Sunâsîrîya is that joint of his above the hand; that (oblation) to Vâyu is this (elbow); that to Sûrya this arm: this (oblation) is indistinct, whence this (limb) also is indistinct.
5	2	7	Now these Seasonal offerings are tripartite and furnished with two joints , whence these limbs of man are tripartite and furnished with two joints. Two of these four (sacrifices) have each three indistinct (low-voiced) oblations; and two of them have two each .
5	2	8	At all four of them they churn out the fire,whence (the draught animal) pulls with all four limbs. At two of them they lead (the fire) forward , whence it (the animal) walks on two (feet at a time) . Thus, then, Pragâpati fashioned for himself a body by means of the Seasonal sacrifices; and in like manner does the Sacrificer who knows this fashion for himself a (divine) body by means of the Seasonal sacrifices.
5	2	9	As to this they say, 'The Vaisvadeva oblation (should have) all (its formulas) in the Gâyatrî, the Varunapraghâsâh all in the Trishtubh, the Great Oblation all in the Gagatî, and the Sunâsîrîya all in the Anushtubh metre, so as to yield a Katushtoma .' But let him not do this, for inasmuch as (his formulas) amount to these (metres) even thereby that wish is obtained.
5	2	10	Now, indeed, (the formulas of) these Seasonal offerings. amount to three hundred and sixty-two Brihatî verses : he thereby obtains both the year and the Mahâvrata ; and thus, indeed, this Sacrificer also has a twofold  foundation, and he thus makes the Sacrificer reach the heavenly world, and establishes him therein.
5	3	1	Saukeya Prâkînayogya came to Uddâlaka Âruni for a disputation on spiritual matters , thinking, 'I desire to know the Agnihotra.'
5	3	2	He said, 'Gautama, what like is thy Agnihotra cow? what like the calf? what like the cow joined by the calf? what like their meeting? what like (the milk) when being milked? what like when it has been milked? what like when brought (from the stable)? what like when put on the fire? what like when the light is thrown on it ; what like when water is poured thereto? what like when being taken off (the fire)? what like when taken off? what like whenbeing ladled out ? what like when ladled out? what like when lifted up (to be taken to the Âhavanîya)? what like when being taken there? what like when held down ?
5	3	3	'What like is the log thou puttest on? what like the first libation? why didst thou put it down (on the Vedi )? why didst thou look away (towards the Gârhapatya )? what like is the second libation?
5	3	4	'Why, having offered, dost thou shake it (the spoon)? why, having cleansed the spoon all round (the spout), didst thou wipe it on the grass-bunch? why, having cleansed it a second time all over, didst thou place thy hand on the south (part of the Vedi)? why didst thou eat (of the milk) the first time, and why the second time? why, on creeping away (from the Vedi), didst thou drink (water)? why, having poured water into the spoon, didst thou sprinkle therewith? why didst thou sprinkle it away a second time, and why a third time in that (northerly) direction? why didst thou pour down water behind the Âhavanîya? why didst thou bring (the offering) to a close? If thou hast offered the Agnihotra knowing this, then it has indeed been offered by thee;but if (thou hast offered it) not knowing this, then it has not been offered by thee.'
5	3	5	He (Uddâlaka) said, 'My Agnihotra cow is Idâ, Manu's daughter ; my calf is of Vâyu's nature; the (cow) joined by the calf is in conjunction therewith ; their meeting is the Virâg; (the milk) when being milked belongs to the Asvins, and when it has been milked, to the Visve Devâh; when brought (from the stable) it belongs to Vâyu; when put on (the fire), to Agni; when the light is thrown on it, it belongs to Indra and Agni; when water is poured thereto it belongs to Varuna; when being taken off (the fire), to Vâyu; when it has been taken off, to Heaven and Earth; when being ladled out, to the Asvins; when it has been ladled out, to the Visve Devâh; when lifted up, to Mahâdeva; when being taken (to the Âhavanîya), to Vâyu; when held down, to Vishnu.
5	3	6	'And the log I put on (the fire) is the resting-place of the libations; and as to the first libation, I therewith gratified the gods; and when I laid down (the spoon with the milk), that belongs to Brihaspati; and when I looked away, then I joined together this and yonder world; and as to the second libation, I thereby settled myself in the heavenly world.
5	3	7	'And when, having offered, I shake (the spoon), that belongs to Vâyu; and when, having cleansed the spoon all round (the spout), I wiped it on the grass-bunch, then I gratified the herbs and trees;and when, having cleansed it a second time all over, I placed my hand on the south (part of the altar-ground), then I gratified the Fathers ; and when I ate (of the milk) the first time, then I gratified myself; and when (I ate) a second time, then I gratified my offspring; and when, having crept away (from the altar-ground), I drank (water), then I gratified the cattle; and when, having poured water into the spoon, I sprinkled therewith, then I gratified the snake-deities; and when (I sprinkled) a second time, then (I gratified) the Gandharvas and Apsaras; and when, a third time, I sprinkled it away in that (northerly) direction, then I opened the gate of heaven; and when I poured down water behind the altar, then I bestowed rain on this world; and when I brought (the sacrifice) to a close, then I filled up whatever there is deficient in the earth.'--'This much, then, reverend sir, we two (know) in common ,' said (Saukeya).
5	3	8	Saukeya, thus instructed, said, 'I would yet ask thee a question, reverend sir.'--'Ask then, Prâkînayogya!' he replied. He (Saukeya) said, 'If, at the time when thy fires are taken out, and the sacrificial vessels brought down, thou wert going to offer, and the offering-fire were then to go out, dost thou know what danger there is in that case for him who offers?' 'I know,' he replied; 'before long the eldest son would die in the case of him who wouldnot know this; but by dint of knowledge I myself have prevailed.'--'What is that knowledge, and what the atonement?' he asked.--'The breath of the mouth has entered the upward breathing--such (is the knowledge); and I should make the offering in the Gârhapatya fire--that would be the atonement, and I should not be committing that sin.'--'This much, then, reverend sir, we two (know) in common,' said (Saukeya).
5	3	9	Saukeya, thus instructed, said, 'I would yet ask thee a question, reverend sir.'--'Ask then, Prâkînayogya!' he replied. He said, 'If, at that very time, the Gârhapatya fire were to go out, dost thou know what danger there is in that case for him who offers? I know it,' he replied; 'before long the master of the house  would die in the case of him who would not know this; but by dint of knowledge I myself have prevailed.'--'What is that knowledge, and what the atonement?' he asked.--'The upward breathing has entered the breath of the mouth--this (is the knowledge); and I would make the offering on the Âhavanîya--this would be the atonement, and I should not be committing that sin.'--'This much, then, reverend sir, we two (know) in common,' said (Saukeya).
5	3	10	Saukeya, thus instructed, said, 'I would yet ask thee a question, reverend sir.'--'Ask then, Prâkînayogya!' he replied. He said, 'If, at that very time, the Anvâhâryapakana fire were to go out, dost thou know what danger there is in that case for him who offers?'--'I know it,' he replied; 'before long all the cattle would die in the case of him who wouldnot know this; but by dint of knowledge I myself have prevailed.'--'What is that knowledge, and what the atonement?' he asked.---'The through-breathing has entered the upward breathing--this (is the knowledge); and I would make the offering on the Gârhapatya fire--this is the atonement; and I should not be committing that sin.'--'This much, then, reverend sir, we two (know) in common,' said (Saukeya).
5	3	11	Saukeya, thus instructed, said, 'I would yet ask thee a question, reverend sir.'--'Ask, then, Prâkînayogya!' he replied. He said, 'If, at that very time, all the fires were to go out, dost thou know what danger there is in that case for him who offers?'--'I know it,' he replied; 'before long the family would be without heirs in the case of him who would not know this; but by dint of knowledge I myself have prevailed.'--'What is that knowledge, and what the atonement?' he asked.--'Having, without delay, churned out fire, and taken out an offering-fire in whatever direction the wind might be blowing, I would perform an offering to Vâyu (the wind): I would then know that my Agnihotra would be successful, belonging as it would to all deities; for all beings, indeed, pass over into the wind, and from out of the wind they are again produced . This would be the atonement, and I should not be committing that sin.'--'This much, then, reverend sir, we two (know) in common,' said (Saukeya).
5	3	12	Saukeya, thus instructed, said, 'I would yet ask thee a question, reverend sir.'--'Ask then, Prâkînayogya!'he replied. He said, 'If at that very time all the fires were to go out, when there should be no wind blowing, dost thou know what danger there would be for him who offers?'--'I know it,' he replied; 'unpleasant things, indeed, he would see in this world, and unpleasant things in yonder world, were he not to know this; but by dint of knowledge I myself have prevailed.'--'What is that knowledge, and what the atonement?' he asked.--'Having, without delay, churned out fire, and taken out an offering-fire towards the east, and sat down behind it, I myself would drink (the Agnihotra milk): I should then know that my Agnihotra would be successful, belonging as it would to all deities, for all beings, indeed, pass into the Brâhmana , and from the Brâhmana they are again produced. That would be the atonement; and I should not be committing that sin.'--'And, verily, I did not know this,' said (Saukeya).
5	3	13	Saukeya, thus instructed, said, 'Here are logs for fuel: I will become thy pupil, reverend sir.' He replied, 'If thou hadst not spoken thus, thy head would have flown off : come, enter as my pupil!'--'So be it,' he said. He then initiated him, and taught him that pain-conquering utterance, Truth: therefore let man speak naught but truth .
5	4	1	He says, 'I have come for Brahmakarya :' he thereby reports himself to the Brahman. He says, 'Let me be a Brahmakârin (student):' he thereby makes himself over to the Brahman. He (the teacher) then says, 'What (ka) is thy name?'--now Ka is Pragâpati: he thus initiates him after making him one belonging to Pragâpati.
5	4	2	He then takes his (right) hand with, 'Indra's disciple thou art; Agni is thy teacher, I am thy teacher, O N.N.!'--now these are two most high and most powerful deities: it is to these two most high and most powerful deities he commits him; and thus his disciple suffers no harm of any kind, nor does he who knows this .
5	4	3	He then commits him to the beings:--'To Pragâpati I commit thee, to the god Savitri I commit thee;'--now these are two most high and most important deities: it is to these two most high and most important deities he commits him; and thus his disciple suffers no harm of any kind, nor does he who knows this.
5	4	4	'To the waters, to the plants I commit thee,'--he thus commits him to the waters and plants.--'To Heaven and Earth I commit thee,'--he thus commits him to these two, heaven and earth, within which all this universe is contained.--'To all beings I commit thee for security from injury,'--he thus commits him to all beings for security from injury; and thus his disciple suffers no harm of any kind, nor does he who knows this.
5	4	5	'Thou art a Brahmakârin,' he says, and thus commits him to the Brahman;--'sip water!'--water, doubtless, means ambrosia: 'sip ambrosia' is thus what he tells him;--'do thy work!'--work, doubtless, means vigour: 'exert vigour' is thus what he tells him;--'put on fuel!'--'enkindle thy mind with fire, with holy lustre!' is what he thereby tells him;--'do not sleep !'--'do not die' is what he thereby says to him;--'sip water!'--water means ambrosia: 'sip ambrosia' is what he thus tells him. He thus encloses him on both sides with ambrosia (the drink of immortality), and thus the Brahmakârin suffers no harm of any kind, nor does he who knows this.
5	4	6	He then recites to him (teaches him) the Sâvitrî ;--formerly, indeed, they taught this (verse) at the end of a year , thinking, 'Children, indeed, areborn after being fashioned for a year : thus we lay speech (voice) into this one as soon as he has been born.'
5	4	7	Or after six months, thinking, 'There are six seasons in the year, and children are born after being fashioned for a year: we thus lay speech into this one as soon as he has been born.'
5	4	8	Or after twenty-four days, thinking, 'There are twenty-four half-months in the year, and children are born when fashioned for a year: we thus lay speech into this one as soon as he has been born.'
5	4	9	Or after twelve days, thinking, 'There are twelve months in the year, and children are born when fashioned for a year: we thus lay speech into this one as soon as he has been born.'
5	4	10	Or after six days, thinking, 'There are six seasons in the year, and children are born when fashioned for a year: we thus lay speech into this one as soon as he has been born.'
5	4	11	Or after three days, thinking, 'There are three seasons in the year, and children are born when fashioned for a year: we thus lay speech into this one as soon as he has been born.'
5	4	12	Concerning this they also sing the verse,--'By laying his right hand on (the pupil), the teacher becomes pregnant (with him): in the third (night) he is born as a Brâhmana with the Sâvitrî .' Let him,however, teach a Brâhmana (the Sâvitrî) at once, for the Brâhmana belongs to Agni, and Agni is born at once : therefore, he should teach the Brâhmana at once.
5	4	13	Now some teach an Anushtubh Sâvitrî, saying, 'The Anushtubh is speech: we thus lay speech into him.' But let him not do so; for if, in that case, any one were to say of him, 'Surely, this (student) has taken away his (the teacher's) speech: he will become dumb;' then that would indeed be likely to come to pass: let him therefore teach him that Gâyatrî Sâvitrî.
5	4	14	And some recite it to him while he (the student) is standing or sitting on (the teacher's) right side; but let him not do this; for if, in that case, any one were to say of him, 'Surely, this (teacher) has born this (student) sideways, he will become averse to him;' then that would indeed be likely to come to pass: let him therefore recite it in a forward (easterly) direction to (the student) looking at him towards the west.
5	4	15	He (first) recites it by pâdas : there being three breathings, the out-breathing, the up-breathing and the through-breathing; it is these he thus lays into him;--then by half-verses: there being thesetwo (principal) breathings, the out-breathing and the up-breathing , it is the out-breathing and the up-breathing he thus lays into him;--then the whole (verse): there being this one vital air (in man), he thus lays the whole vital air into the whole of him.
5	4	16	As to this they say, 'When one has admitted a Brâhmana to a term of studentship, he should not carry on sexual intercourse, lest he should generate this Brâhmana from shed seed; for, indeed, he who enters on a term of studentship becomes an embryo.'
5	4	17	And concerning this they also say, 'He may nevertheless do so, if he chooses; for these creatures are of two kinds, divine and human,--these human creatures are born from the womb, and the divine creatures, being the metres (verses of scripture), are born from the month: it is therefrom he (the teacher) produces him, and therefore he may do so (have intercourse) if he chooses.'
5	4	18	And they also say, 'He who is a Brahmakârin should not eat honey, lest he should reach the end of food, for honey, doubtless, is the utmost (supreme) essence of plants.' But Svetaketu Âruneya, when eating honey, whilst he was a student, said, 'This honey, in truth, is the remainder (essential part) of the triple science (the Vedas), and he, indeed, who has such a remainder, is an essence.' And, indeed, if a Brahmakârin, knowing this, eats honey, it is just as if he were to utter either a Rik-verse, or Yagus-formula, or a Sâman-tune: let him therefore eat freely of it.
5	5	1	Now, when the gods were passing upwards to the world of heaven, the Asuras enveloped them in darkness. They spake, 'Verily, by nothing else save a sacrificial session is there any way of dispelling this (darkness): well, then, let us perform a sacrificial session!'
5	5	2	They entered upon a sacrificial session of a hundred Agnishtoma (days), and dispelled the darkness as far as one may see whilst sitting; and in like manner did they, by (a session of) a hundred Ukthya (days), dispel the darkness as far as one may see whilst standing.
5	5	3	They spake, 'We do indeed dispel the darkness, but not the whole of it: come, let us resort to Father Pragâpati.' Having come to Father Pragâpati, they spake, 'Reverend sir, when we were passing upwards to the world of heaven the Asuras enveloped us in darkness.'
5	5	4	'We entered upon a sacrificial session of a hundred Agnishtomas, and dispelled the darkness as far as one may see whilst sitting; and in like manner did we dispel the darkness as far as one may see whilst standing: do thou teach us, reverend sir, how, by dispelling the Asuras and darkness, and all evil, we shall find (the way to) the world of heaven!'
5	5	5	He spake, 'Surely, ye proceeded by means of two sacrifices, the Agnishtoma and Ukthya, which do not contain all Soma-rites ;--enter ye upona sacrificial session of a hundred Atirâtras: when ye have thereby repelled the Asuras and darkness, and all evil, ye shall find the world of heaven.'
5	5	6	They entered upon a sacrificial session of a hundred Atirâtras; and, having thereby repelled the Asuras and darkness, and all evil, they found (the way to) the world of heaven. In their first fifty days  the night-hymns reached into the day, and the day-hymns into the night.
5	5	7	They spake, 'Verily, we have got into confusion and know not what to do: come, let us resort to Father Pragâpati!' Having come to Father Pragâpati, they spake (the verses), 'Our night-hymns are (chanted) in daytime, and those of the day at night: O sage, being learned and wise, teach thou us who are ignorant (how to perform) the sacrifices!'
5	5	8	He then recited to them as follows, 'A stronger, pursuing, has, as it were, driven a great snake from its own place, the lake: therefore the sacrificial session is not carried through.'
5	5	9	'For your Âsvina (sastra), being recited, has indeed driven the morning-litany from its place .'-- 'What ye, being wise, have unwise-like driven from its place, take ye up that gently through the Prasâstri, reciting so as not to disturb  (the Hotri).'
5	5	10	They spake, 'How, then, reverend sir, is (the Âsvina-sastra properly) recited and how is the recitation not disturbed?' He spake, 'When the Hotri, in reciting the Âsvina-sastra, reaches the end of the Gâyatra metre of the Âgneya-kratu , the Pratiprasthâtri  should carry round the Vasatîvarî water , and bespeak the Prâtar-anuvâka for the Maitrâvaruna (seated) between the two Havirdhâna (carts containing the offering-material). The Hotri recites (the Âsvina-sastra) in a loud voice, and the other (the Maitrâvaruna) repeats (the morning-litany) in a low voice, only just muttering it: in thisway he does not run counter to (the Hotri's) speech by (his own) speech, nor metre by metre.
5	5	11	'When the Prâtar-anuvâka has been completed, he (the Pratiprasthâtri), having offered, at their proper time , the Upâmsu and Antaryâma cups , presses out the straining-cloth and puts it in the Dronakalasa . And when ye have performed the (offering of the cups of) fermented Soma , and returned (to the Sadas), ye should drink the fermented Soma (remaining in those cups). Having then, in the proper form, completed the "tail of the sacrifice," and taken up the cups of Soma (drawn) subsequent to the Antaryâma , and offered the oblation of drops , as well as the Santani-oblation , ye should perform the Bahishpavamâna chant, and enter upon the day (-performance).'
5	5	12	Concerning this there are these verses:--With four harnessed Saindhava (steeds) the sages left behind them the gloom--the wise gods who spun out the session of a hundred sacrifices.'
5	5	13	In this (sacrificial session) there are, indeed, four harnessed (steeds),--to wit, two Hotris and two Adhvaryus.--'Like unto the artificer contriving spikes to the spear, the sages coupled the ends oftwo days: now the Dânavas, we know , will not disorder the sacrificial thread of them stretched out by us.--They leave undone the work of the previous day, and carry it through on the following day,--difficult to be understood. is the wisdom of the deities: streams of Soma flow, interlinked with streams of Soma!--Even as they constantly sprinkle the equal prize-winning  steeds, so (they pour out) the cups full of fiery liquor in the palace of Ganamegaya.' Then the Asura-Rakshas went away.
5	6	1	There are five great sacrifices, and they, indeed, are great sacrificial sessions,--to wit, the sacrifice to beings, the sacrifice to men, the sacrifice to the Fathers, the sacrifice to the gods, and the sacrifice to the Brahman.
5	6	2	Day by day one should offer an oblation to beings: thus he performs that sacrifice to beings. Day by day one should offer (presents to guests) up to the cupful of water : thus he performs thatsacrifice to men. Day by day one should offer with Svadhâ up to the cupful of water : thus he performs that sacrifice to the Fathers. Day by day one should perform with Svâhâ up to the log of firewood : thus he performs that sacrifice to the gods.
5	6	3	Then as to the sacrifice to the Brahman. The sacrifice to the Brahman is one's own (daily) study (of the Veda). The guhû-spoon of this same sacrifice to the Brahman is speech, its upabhrit the mind, its dhruvâ the eye, its sruva mental power, its purificatory bath truth, its conclusion heaven. And, verily, however great the world he gains by giving away (to the priests) this earth replete with wealth, thrice that and more--an imperishable world does he gain, whosoever, knowing this, studies day by day his lesson (of the Veda): therefore let him study his daily lesson.
5	6	4	Verily, the Rik-texts are milk-offerings to the gods; and whosoever, knowing this, studies day by day the Rik-texts for his lesson, thereby satisfies the gods with milk-offerings; and, being satisfied, they satisfy him by (granting him) security ofpossession , by life-breath, by seed, by his whole self, and by all auspicious blessings; and rivers of ghee and rivers of honey flow for his (departed) Fathers, as their accustomed draughts.
5	6	5	And, verily, the Yagus-texts are ghee-offerings to the gods; and whosoever, knowing this, studies day by day the Yagus-texts for his lesson thereby satisfies the gods with ghee-offerings; and, being satisfied, they satisfy him by security of possession, by life-breath, by seed, by his whole self, and by all auspicious blessings; and rivers of ghee and rivers of honey flow for his Fathers, as their accustomed draughts.
5	6	6	And, verily, the Sâman-texts are Soma-offerings to the gods; and whosoever, knowing this, studies day by day the Sâman-texts for his lesson thereby satisfies the gods with Soma-offerings; and, being satisfied, they satisfy him by security of possession, by life-breath, by seed, by his whole self, and by all auspicious blessings; and rivers of ghee and rivers of honey flow for his Fathers, as their accustomed draughts.
5	6	7	And, verily, the (texts of the) Atharvâṅgiras are fat-offerings to the gods; and whosoever, knowing this, studies day by day the (texts of the) Atharvâṅgiras for his lesson, satisfies the gods with fat-offerings; and, being satisfied, they satisfy him by security of possession, by life-breath, by seed, by his whole self, and by all auspicious blessings; and rivers of ghee and rivers of honey flow for his Fathers, as their accustomed draughts.
5	6	8	And, verily, the precepts , the sciences , the dialogue , the traditional myths and legends , and the Nârâsamsî Gâthâs  are honey-offerings to the gods; and whosoever, knowing this, studies day by day the precepts, the sciences, the dialogue, the traditional myths and legends, and the Nârâsamsî Gâthâs, for his lesson, satisfies the gods with honey-offerings; and, being satisfied, they satisfy him by (granting him) security of possession, by life-breath, by seed, by his whole self, and by all auspicious blessings; and rivers of ghee and rivers of honey flow for his Fathers, as their accustomed draughts.
5	6	9	Now, for this, sacrifice to the Brahman there are four Vashat-calls ,--to wit, when the wind blows, when it lightens, when it thunders, and when it rumbles  whence he who knows this should certainly study  when the wind is blowing, and when it lightens, or thunders, or rumbles, so as not to lose his Vashat-calls; and verily he is freed from recurring death, and attains to community of nature (or, being) with the Brahman. And should he be altogether unable (to study), let him at least read a single divine word; and thus he is not shut out from beings .
5	7	1	Now, then, the praise of the study (of the scriptures). The study and teaching (of the Veda) are a source of pleasure to him, he becomes ready-minded , and independent of others, and day by day he acquires wealth. He sleeps peacefully; he is the best physician for himself; and (peculiar) to him are restraint of the senses, delight in the one thing , growth of intelligence, fame, and the (task of) perfecting the people . The growingintelligence gives rise to four duties attaching to the Brâhmana--Brâhmanical descent, a befitting deportment, fame, and the perfecting of the people; and the people that are being perfected guard the Brâhmana by four duties--by (showing him) respect, and liberality, (and by granting him) security against oppression, and security against capital punishment.
5	7	2	And, truly, whatever may be the toils here between heaven and earth, the study (of the scriptures) is their last stage, their goal (limit) for him who, knowing this, studies his lesson: therefore one's (daily) lesson should be studied.
5	7	3	And, verily, whatever portion of the sacred poetry (khandas) he studies for his lesson with that sacrificial rite , offering is made by him who, knowing this, studies his lesson: therefore one's (daily) lesson should be studied.
5	7	4	And, verily, if he studies his lesson, even though lying on a soft couch, anointed, adorned and completely satisfied, he is burned (with holy fire ) up to the tips of his nails, whosoever, knowing this, studies his lesson: therefore one's (daily) lesson should be studied.
5	7	5	The Rik-texts, truly, are honey, the Sâman-texts ghee, and the Yagus-texts ambrosia; and, indeed, when he studies the dialogue that (speech and reply) is a mess of milk and a mess of meat.
5	7	6	And, indeed, he who, knowing this, studies day by day the Rik-texts for his lesson, satisfies the gods with honey, and, thus satisfied, they satisfy him by every object of desire, by every kind of enjoyment.
5	7	7	And he who, knowing this, studies day by day the Sâman-texts for his lesson, satisfies the gods with ghee; and, being satisfied, they satisfy him by every object of desire, by every kind of enjoyment.
5	7	8	And he who, knowing this, studies day by day the Yagus-texts for his lesson, satisfies the gods with ambrosia; and, being satisfied, they satisfy him by every object of desire, by every kind of enjoyment.
5	7	9	And he who, knowing this, studies day by day the dialogue, the traditional myths and legends, for his lesson, satisfies the gods by messes of milk and meat; and, being satisfied, they satisfy him by every object of desire, by every kind of enjoyment.
5	7	10	Moving, indeed, are the waters, moving is the sun, moving the moon, and moving the stars; and, verily, as if these deities did not move and act, even so will the Brâhmana be on that day on which he does not study his lesson: therefore one's (daily) lesson should be studied. And hence let him at least pronounce either a Rik-verse or a Yagus-formula, or a Sâman-verse, or a Gâthâ, or a Kumbyâ , to ensure continuity of the Vrata .
5	8	1	Verily, in the beginning, Pragâpati alone was here. He desired, 'May I exist, may I be generated.' He wearied himself and performed fervid devotions: from him, thus wearied and heated, the three worlds were created--the earth, the air, and the sky.
5	8	2	He heated these three worlds, and from them, thus heated, three lights (gyotis) were produced--Agni (the fire), he who blows here (Vâyu), and Sûrya (the sun).
5	8	3	He heated these three lights, and from them, thus heated, the three Vedas were produced--the Rig-veda from Agni, the Yagur-veda from Vâyu, and the Sâma-veda from Sûrya.
5	8	4	He heated these three Vedas, and from them, thus heated, three luminous essences  were produced-- 'bhûh' from the Rig-veda, 'bhuvah' from the Yagur-veda, and 'svar' from the Sâma-veda. And with the Rig-veda they then performed the work of the Hotri priest, with the Yagur-veda the work of the Adhvaryu, and with the Sâma-veda the work of the Udgâtri; and what luminous essence  there was in the threefold science, therewith the work of the Brahman priest then proceeded.
5	8	5	The gods spake unto Pragâpati, 'If our sacrifice were to fail in respect of either the Rik, or the Yagus, or the Sâman, whereby should we heal it?'
5	8	6	He spake, ‘If (it were to fail) in respect of the Rik, ye should take ghee by four ladlings and offer it in the Gârhapatya fire with 'Bhûh!' and if in respect of the Yagus, ye should take ghee by four ladlings and offer it in the Âgnîdhrîya--or in the Anvâhâryapakana  in the case of a Haviryagña--with 'Bhuvah!' and if in respect of the Sâman, ye should take ghee by four ladlings and offer it in the Âhavanîya with 'Svar!' But if it should not be known (where the mistake has occurred), ye should make offering in the Âhavanîya after utteringrapidly all (the three sacred words ): thus one heals the Rig-veda by the Rig-veda , the Yagur-veda by the Yagur-veda, and the Sâma-veda by the Sâma-veda;--even as one would put together joint with joint , so does he put together (the broken part of the sacrifice) whoever heals it by means of these (three sacred words). But if he heals it in any other way than this, it would be just as if one tried to put together something that is broken with something else that is broken, or as if one were to apply some poison as lotion to a broken part . Let him therefore appoint only one who knows this (to officiate as) his Brahman, and not one who does not know this.
5	8	7	As to this they say, 'Seeing that the work of the Hotri is performed with the Rig-veda, that of the Adhvaryu with the Yagur-veda, and that of the Udgâtri with the Sâma-veda, wherewith then is the work of the Brahman (performed)?' Let him reply, 'With that threefold science.'
5	9	1	Now, the Amsu (cup of Soma) , indeed, is no other than Pragâpati; and it is the body of this (sacrifice), for Pragâpati, indeed, is the body. And the Adâbhya  (cup of Soma) is no other than speech. When he draws the Amsu-cup, and then the Adâbhya-cup, he thereby constructs the body of this (sacrifice) and then establishes that speech therein.
5	9	2	And, indeed, the Amsu is also the mind, and the Adâbhya speech; and the Amsu is the out-breathing, and the Adâbhya the up-breathing; and the Amsu is the eye, and the Adâbhya the ear: these two cups they draw for the sake of wholeness and completeness.
5	9	3	Now, the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pragâpati, were contending,--it was for this very sacrifice, for Pragâpati, that they were contending, saying, 'Ours he shall be! ours he shall be!'
5	9	4	The gods then went on singing praises, and toiling. They saw this cup of Soma, this Adâbhya, and drew it: they seized upon the (three) Soma-services, and possessed themselves of the whole sacrifice, and excluded the Asuras from the sacrifice.
5	9	5	They spake, 'Surely, we have destroyed (adabhâma) them;' whence (the cup is called) Adâbhya;--'they have not destroyed (dabh) us;' whence also (it is called) Adâbhya. And the Adâbhyabeing speech, this speech is indestructible, whence also it is (called) Adâbhya; and, verily, in like manner does he who knows this possess himself of the whole sacrifice of his spiteful enemy, and exclude and shut out his spiteful enemy from all participation in the sacrifice.
5	9	6	Into the same vessel with which he draws the Amsu  he pours water from the Nigrâbhyâh , and therein puts those Soma-plants  with ,--
5	9	7	'Thou art taken with a support : for Agni I take thee, possessed of the Gâyatrî metre!'--the morning-service is of Gâyatrî nature: he thus possesses himself of the morning-service;--'For Indra I take thee, possessed of the Trishtubh metre!'--the midday-service is of Trishtubh nature: he thus possesses himself of the midday-service;--'For the Visve Devâh I take thee, possessed of the Gagatî metre!'--the evening-service is of Gagatî nature: he thus possesses himself of the evening-service;--'The Anushtubh is thy song of praise;'--whatever is subsequent to the (three) services , that is of Anushtubh nature: it is thereof he thus possesseshimself. He does not press this (batch of Soma-plants) lest he should injure speech (or, the voice of the sacrifice), for the press-stone is a thunderbolt, and the Adâbhya is speech.
5	9	8	He merely shakes the (cup with the) plants with , 'In the flow of the streaming (waters) I waft thee! in the flow of the gurgling I waft thee! in the flow of the jubilant I waft thee! in the flow of the most delightsome I waft thee! in the flow of the most sweet I waft thee!' These doubtless are the divine waters: he thus bestows sap on him (Pragâpati, the sacrifice) by means of both the divine and the human waters which there are.
5	9	9	'Thee, the bright, I waft in the bright,'--for he indeed wafts the bright one in the bright;--'in the form of the day, in the rays of the sun;'--he thus wafts it both in the form of the day and in the rays of the sun.
5	9	10	, 'Mightily shineth the towering form of the ball,'--for mightily indeed shines that towering form of the ball, to wit, yonder burning (sun);--'the bright one, the leader of the bright one, Soma, the leader of Soma,'--he thereby makes that bright (sun) the leader of the bright (Soma), and Soma the leader of the Soma;--'what indestructible, watchful name there is of thine, for that do I take thee;'--for this, to wit, speech, is indeed his (Soma's) indestructible (adâbhya), watchful name: it is thus speech he thereby takes for speech.
5	9	11	Then, stepping out (from the Havirdhâna shed ) to (the Âhavanîya), he offers with, 'O Soma, to this thy Soma, hail!'--he thus offers Soma to Soma, and so does not throw speech into the fire . He breathes over gold : the meaning of this is the same as there (on the occasion of the Amsu). He gives as many presents (to the priests) as for the Amsu-graha.
5	9	12	He then puts the Soma-plants back (on the heap of plants in the Havirdhâna) with , 'Enter thou gladly Agni's dear seat, O divine Soma!--Enter thou willingly Indra's dear seat, O divine Soma!--As our friend enter thou, O divine Soma, the dear seat of the Visve Devâh!' On that former occasion he possessed himself of the (three) Soma services; he now restores them again, and causes them to be no longer used up; and with them thus restored they perform the sacrifice.
6	1	1	Now, Bhrigu, the son of Varuna, deemed himself superior to his father Varuna in knowledge . Varuna became aware of this: 'He deems himself superior to me in knowledge,' he thought.
6	1	2	He said, 'Go thou eastward, my boy; andhaving seen there what thou shalt see, go thou southwards; and having seen there what thou shalt see, go thou westward; and having seen there what thou shalt see, go thou northward; and having seen there what thou shalt see, go thou toward the northern of those two intermediate quarters in front , and tell me then what thou shalt see there.'
6	1	3	He then went forth from thence eastward, and lo, men were dismembering men , hewing off their limbs one by one, and saying, 'This to thee, this to me!' He said, 'Horrible! woe is me! men here have dismembered men, hewing off their limbs one by one!' They replied, 'Thus, indeed, these dealt with us in yonder world, and so we now deal with them in return.' He said, 'Is there no atonement for this?'--'Yes, there is,' they replied.--'What is it?'--'Thy father knows.'
6	1	4	He went forth from thence southward, and lo, men were dismembering men, cutting up their limbs one by one, and saying, 'This to thee, this to me!' He said, 'Horrible! woe is me! men here have dismembered men, cutting up their limbs one by one!' They replied, 'Thus, indeed, these dealt with us in yonder world, and so we now deal with them in return.' He said, 'Is there no atonement for this?'--'Yes, there is,' they replied.--'What is it?'--'Thy father knows.'
6	1	5	He went forth from thence westward, and lo, men, sitting still, were being eaten by men, sitting still! He said, 'Horrible! woe is me! men, sitting still, are eating men, sitting still!' They replied, 'Thus, indeed, these have dealt with us in yonder world, and so we now deal with them in return.' He said, 'Is there no atonement for this? Yes, there is,' they replied.--'What is it? Thy father knows.'
6	1	6	He went forth from thence northward, and lo, men, crying aloud, were being eaten by men, crying aloud! He said, 'Horrible! woe is me! men, crying aloud, here are eating men, crying aloud!' They replied, 'Thus, indeed, these dealt with us in yonder world, and so we now deal with them in return.' He said, 'Is there no atonement for this?'--'Yes, there is,' they replied.--'What is it? Thy father knows.'
6	1	7	He went forth from thence toward the northern of those two intermediate quarters in front, and lo, there were two women, one beautiful, one over-beautiful : between them stood a man, black, with yellow eyes, and a staff in his hand. On seeing him, terror seized him, and he went home, and sat down. His father said to him, 'Study thy day's lesson (of scripture): why dost thou not, study thy lesson?' He said, What am I to study? there is nothing whatever.' Then Varuna knew, 'He has indeed seen it!
6	1	8	He spake, ‘As to those men whom thousawest in the eastern region being dismembered by men hewing off their limbs one by one, and saying, "This to thee, this to me!" they were the trees: when one puts fire-wood from trees on (the fire) he subdues the trees, and conquers the world of trees.
6	1	9	‘And as to those men whom thou sawest in the southern region being dismembered by men cutting up their limbs one by one, and saying, "This to thee, this to me!" they were the cattle; when one makes offering with milk he subdues the cattle, and conquers the world of cattle.
6	1	10	‘And as to those men thou sawest in the western region who, whilst sitting still, were being eaten by men sitting still, they were the herbs: when one illumines (the Agnihotra milk) with a straw , he subdues the herbs, and conquers the world of herbs.
6	1	11	‘And as to those men thou sawest in the northern region who, whilst crying aloud, were being eaten by men crying aloud, they were the waters: when one pours water to (the Agnihotra milk), he subdues the waters, and conquers the world of waters.
6	1	12	‘And as to those two women whom thou sawest, one beautiful and one over-beautiful,--the beautiful one is Belief: when one offers the first libation (of the Agnihotra) he subdues Belief, and conquers Belief; and the over-beautiful one is Unbelief: when one offers the second libation, he subdues Unbelief, and conquers Unbelief.
6	1	13	'And as to the black man with yellow eyes,who was standing between them with a staff in his hand, he was Wrath: when, having poured water into the spoon, one pours (the libation into the fire), he subdues Wrath, and conquers Wrath; and, verily, whosoever, knowing this, offers the Agnihotra, thereby conquers everything, and subdues everything.'
6	2	1	Now, Ganaka of Videha once met some Brâhmanas who were travelling about , to wit, Svetaketu Âruneya, Somasushma Sâtyayagñi, and Yâgñavalkya. He said to them, 'How do ye each of you perform the Agnihotra?'
6	2	2	Svetaketu Âruneya replied, 'O great king, I make offering, in one another, to two heats, never-failing and overflowing with glory.'--'How is that?' asked the king.--'Well, Âditya (the sun) is heat: to him I make offering in Agni in the evening; and Agni, indeed, is heat: to him I make offering in the morning in Âditya .'--'What becomes of him who offers in this way?' asked theking.--'He verily becomes never-failing in prosperity and glory, and attains to 'the fellowship of those two deities, and to an abode in their world.'
6	2	3	Then Somasushma Sâtyayagñi said, 'I, O king, make offering to light in light.'--'How is that?' asked the king.--'Well, Âditya is light: to him I make offering in Agni in the evening; and Agni, indeed, is light: to him I make offering in Âditya in the morning.'--'What becomes of him who offers in this way? He verily becomes lightsome, and glorious, and prosperous; and attains to the fellowship of those two deities, and to an abode in their world.'
6	2	4	Then Yâgñavalkya said, 'When I take out the fire (from the Gârhapatya), it is the Agnihotra itself, I thereby raise  Now when Âditya (the sun) sets, all the gods follow him; and when they see that fire taken out by me, they turn back. Having then cleansed the (sacrificial) vessels, and deposited them (on the Vedi), and having milked the Agnihotra cow, I gladden them, when I see them, and when they see me.'--'Thou, O Yâgñavalkya, hast inquired most closely into the nature of the Agnihotra,' said the king; 'I bestow a hundred cows on thee. But not even thou (knowest) either the uprising, or the progress, or the support, or the contentment, or the return, or the renascent world of those two (libations of the Agnihotra).' Thus saying, he mounted his car and drove away.
6	2	5	They said, 'Surely, this fellow of a Râganya has outtalked us: come, let us challenge him toa theological disputation!' Yâgñavalkya said, 'We are Brâhmanas, and he is a Râganya: if we were to vanquish him, whom should we say we had vanquished? But if he were to vanquish us, people would say of us that a Râganya had vanquished Brâhmanas: do not think of this!' They approved of his words. But Yâgñavalkya, mounting his car, drove after (the king). He overtook him, and he (the king) said, 'Is it to know the Agnihotra, Yâgñavalkya?'--'The Agnihotra, O king!' he replied.
6	2	6	‘Well, those two libations, when offered, rise upwards: they enter the air, and make the air their offering-fire, the wind their fuel, the sun-motes their pure libation: they satiate the air, and rise upwards therefrom.
6	2	7	‘They enter the sky, and make the sky their offering-fire, the sun their fuel, and the moon their pure libation: they satiate the sky, and return from there.
6	2	8	‘They enter this (earth), and make this (earth) their offering-fire, the fire their fuel, and the herbs their pure libation: they satiate this (earth), and rise upwards therefrom.
6	2	9	‘They enter man, and make his mouth their offering-fire, his tongue their fuel, and food their pure libation: they satiate man; and, verily, for him who, knowing this, eats food the Agnihotra comes to be offered. They rise upwards from there.
6	2	10	'They enter woman, and make her lap their offering-fire, her womb the fuel,--for that (womb) is called the bearer, because by it Pragâpati bore creatures,--and the seed their pure libation: they satiate woman; and, verily, for him who, knowing this, approaches his mate, the Agnihotra comes tobe offered. The son who is born therefrom is the renascent world: this is the Agnihotra, Yâgñavalkya, there is nothing higher than this.' Thus he spoke; and Yâgñavalkya granted him a boon. He said, 'Let mine be the (privilege of) asking questions of thee when I list, Yâgñavalkya!' Thenceforth Ganaka was a Brahman.
6	3	1	Ganaka of Videha performed a sacrifice accompanied with numerous gifts to the priests. Setting apart a thousand cows, he said, 'He who is the most learned in sacred writ amongst you, O Brâhmanas, shall drive away these (cows) !'
6	3	2	Yâgñavalkya then said, 'This way (drive) them!' They said, 'Art thou really the most learned in sacred writ amongst us, Yâgñavalkya?' He replied, 'Reverence be to him who is most learned in sacred writ! We are but hankering after cows !'
6	3	3	They then said (to one another), 'Which of us shall question him?' The shrewd Sâkalya said, 'I!' When he (Yâgñavalkya) saw him, he said, 'Have the Brâhmanas made of thee a thing for quenching the firebrand, Sâkalya?'
6	3	4	He said , 'How many gods are there, Yâgñavalkya?'--'Three hundred and three, and three thousand and three,' he replied.--'Yea, so it is!' he said. 'How many gods are there really, Yâgñavalkya?'--'Thirty-three.'--'Yea, so it is!' he said. 'How many gods are there really, Yâgñavalkya?'--'Three.'--'Yea, so it is!' he said. 'How many gods are there really, Yâgñavalkya?'--'Two.'--'Yea, so it is!' he said. 'How many gods are there really, Yâgñavalkya?'--'One and a half.'--'Yea, so it is!' he said. 'How many gods are there really, Yâgñavalkya?'--'One.'--'Yea, so it is!' he said. 'Who are those three hundred and three, and three thousand and three?'
6	3	5	He replied, 'These are their powers, but thirty-three gods indeed there are.'--'Who are those thirty-three? Eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, and twelve Âdityas,--that makes thirty-one; and Indra and Pragâpati make up the thirty-three.'
6	3	6	'Who are the Vasus?'--'Agni, the Earth, Vâyu (the wind), the Air, Âditya (the sun), Heaven, the Moon, and the Stars:--these are the Vasus, for these cause all this (universe) to abide (vas), and hence they are the Vasus.'
6	3	7	'Who are the Rudras?'--'These ten vital airs in man, and the self (spirit) is the eleventh: when these depart from this mortal body, they cause wailing (rud), and hence they are the Rudras.'
6	3	8	'Who are the Âdityas?'--'The twelve months of the year: these are the Âdityas, for they pass whilst laying hold on everything here; and inasmuch as they pass whilst laying hold (â-dâ) on everything here, they are the Âdityas.'
6	3	9	'Who is Indra, and who Pragâpati?'--'Indra, indeed, is thunder , and Pragâpati the sacrifice.'--'What is thunder?'--'The thunderbolt.'--'What is the sacrifice?'--'Cattle.'
6	3	10	'Who are those three gods?'--'These three worlds, for therein all the gods are contained.'--'Who are those two gods?'--'Food and breath. (life).'--'Who is the one and a half?'--'He who is blowing here  (Vâyu, the wind).'--'Who is the one god?'--'Breath.'
6	3	11	He (Yâgñavalkya) said, 'Thou hast gone on questioning me beyond the deity , beyond which there must be no questioning: thou shalt die ere such and such a day, and not even thy bones shall reach thy home!' And so, indeed, did he (Sâkalya) die; and robbers carried off his bones , taking them for something else . Wherefore let no man decry  any one, for even (by) knowing this, he gets the better of him .
7	1	1	He performs the animal sacrifice. Now the animal sacrifice means cattle: thus, when he performs the animal sacrifice (pasubandha, the binding of the animal), it is in order that he may be possessed of cattle. Let him perform it at his home, thinking, 'I will bind (attach) cattle to my home.' Let him perform it in the season of abundant fodder, thinking, 'I will bind to myself cattle in a season of abundant fodder. For, whilst he is offering , the Sacrificer's fires become worn out, and so does the Sacrificer, along with the worn-out fires, and along with the Sacrificer his house and cattle.
7	1	2	And when he performs the animal sacrifice, he renews his fires, and so, along with the renewal of his fires, does the Sacrificer (renew himself), and along with the Sacrificer his house and cattle. And beneficial to life, indeed, is that redemption of hisown self ; for whilst he is offering the Sacrificer's fires long for flesh; they set their minds on the Sacrificer and harbour designs on him. In other fires  people do indeed cook any kind of meat, but these (sacrificial fires) have no desire for any other flesh but this (sacrificial animal), and for him to whom they belong.
7	1	3	Now, when he performs the animal offering. he thereby redeems himself--male by male, for the victim is a male, and the Sacrificer is a male. And this, indeed, to wit, flesh, is the best kind of food: he thus becomes an eater of the best kind of food. Let not a year pass by for him without his offering; for the year means life: it is thus immortal life he thereby confers upon himself.
7	2	1	Now there is one animal sacrifice of the Haviryagña order , and another of the order of the Soma-sacrifice. Of the Haviryagña order is that at which he (the Adhvaryu) brings him fast-food , leads waterforward , and pours out a jarful of water , and at which (the Sacrificer) strides the Vishnu-strides ; and of the order of the Soma-sacrifice is that (animal sacrifice) at which these (rites) are not performed.
7	2	2	Concerning this they ask, 'Is the animal sacrifice an ishti or a great (Soma-) sacrifice?'--'A great sacrifice,' let him say; 'for in that (other) case  thou hast made the animal sacrifice an ishti, and shattered it.' Thus he should say to him.
7	2	3	Its fore-offerings are the morning-service , its after-offerings the evening-service, and its sacrificial cake  the midday-service.
7	2	4	Now, some bring up the Dakshinâs (presents to the priests) when the omentum has been offered ;but let him not do so, for if, in that case, any one were to say of him, 'Surely, this (Sacrificer) has brought the Dakshinâs outside of the vital airs (or, of life), he has not strengthened his vital airs: he will become either blind, or lame, or deaf, or paralyzed on one side;' then that would indeed he likely to come to pass.
7	2	5	Let him perform it in this way:--when the Idâ of the cake-offering has been invoked, he should bring up the Dakshinâs; for to Indra belongs this vital air in the centre (of the body): by means of the Dakshinâs he thus strengthens this vital air in the centre (of the body); and to Indra also belongs the midday Soma-service, and at the midday-service the Dakshinâs are brought up: therefore. he should bring up the Dakshinâs after the invocation of the Idâ of the cake-offering.
7	2	6	Here now they say, 'Seeing that the want of the purificatory bath in the case of the initiated is improper, Adhvaryu, when didst thou initiate him?' Well, let them  sustain him till the purificatory bath,--to wit, the Adhvaryu, the Pratiprasthâtri, the Hotri, the Maitrâvaruna, the Brahman, and the Âgnîdhra, for it is through these that this (formula) is called 'shaddhotri ': having rapidly muttered that 'shaddhotri,' he offers, performing either one or five oblations of ghee ,--'The heaven is his  back, the air his body, O Vâkaspati, by his limbs he gave rise to the sacrifice, by his forms to the earth; by his flawless voice and his flawless tongue to the god-gladdening invocation, Hail!' This, indeed, is his initiation.
7	2	7	As to this they say, 'Seeing that the want of the purificatory bath in the case of the initiated is improper, Adhvaryu, when didst thou take him down to the purificatory bath?' Well, when they perform with the heart-spit , that is his purificatory bath.
7	2	8	Madhuka Paiṅgya once said, 'Some perform the animal sacrifice without Soma, and others do so with Soma. Now, Soma was in the heavens, and Gâyatrî, having become a bird, fetched him; and inasmuch as one of his leaves (parna) was cut off ,that was how the Parna-tree arose:' such, indeed, is (the passage in) the Brâhmana that is told. And some, it is true, perform the animal sacrifice without Soma, and others with Soma; for he who makes the sacrificial stake other than of Palâsa wood, performs the animal sacrifice without Soma; and he who makes the sacrificial stake of Palâsa performs the animal sacrifice with Soma: therefore let him make his sacrificial stake of Palâsa wood.
7	3	1	Such a (sacrificial stake) as has much substance  is not auspicious to cattle, whence he who desires to have cattle should not make such a one his sacrificial stake: but such a one as is of little hardness is auspicious to cattle, whence he who desires to have cattle should make such a one his sacrificial stake.
7	3	2	And such a one as, while being crooked, has a top like a spit, is called 'kapotî '; and whoever makes such a one his sacrificial stake certainly goes to yonder world before his full measure of life: therefore let no one wishing for long life make such a one his sacrificial stake.
7	3	3	And such a one as is bent at the top, and bent outwards  in the middle, is a type of hunger (poverty); and if any one makes such a one his sacrificial stake, his dependants will certainly be hungry; therefore let no one wishing for food make such a one his sacrificial stake. But such a one as is bent at the top and bent inwards in the middle, is a type of food (prosperity): therefore let him who wishes for food make such a one his sacrificial stake.
7	4	1	Now, when he who is about to perform an animal sacrifice makes a stake one cubit long, he thereby gains this (terrestrial) world; and when (he makes) one two cubits long, he thereby gains the air-world; and when be makes one three cubits long, he thereby gains the heavens; and when he makes one four cubits long, he thereby gains the regions. But, indeed, that sacrificial stake of the (ordinary) animal sacrifice is either three or four cubits long, and one that is above that belongs to the Soma-sacrifice.
7	4	2	As to this they say, 'Should he offer the butter-portions or not?'--'Let him offer them,' they say; 'for the two butter-portions are the eyes of the sacrifice, and what were man without eyes?' For as long as a co-sharer is not bought off by (receiving) a share of his own, so long does he consider himself not bought off; but when he is bought off by a share of his own, then, indeed, he considers himself boughtoff: when the Hotri, on that occasion , recites, 'Endow the Rakshas with blood!' he buys him off by (assigning to him) a share of his own.
7	4	3	For on that occasion  the anguish of the victim, in being slaughtered, becomes concentrated in the heart, and from the heart (it flows) into the spit. Thus, if they (were to) cook the animal together with the heart, the anguish would again spread all over the animal: let him therefore cook it (the heart) after spitting it from the side on a stick.
7	4	4	He makes an underlayer of ghee (in the offering-ladle): this he makes a type of the earth; he then puts a chip of gold thereon: this he makes a type of fire; he then puts the omentum thereon: this he makes a type of the air; he then puts a chip of gold thereon: this he makes a type of the sun; and what (ghee) he pours upon it, that he makes a type of the heavens. This, then, is that five-portioned omentum,--fivefold is the sacrifice, fivefold the sacrificial animal, and five seasons there are in the year: this is why the omentum consists of five portions .
8	1	1	Verily, even as this cart-wheel, or a potter's wheel, would creak  if not steadied, so, indeed, were these worlds unfirm and unsteadied.
8	1	2	Pragâpati then bethought him, 'How may these worlds become firm and steadied?' By means of the mountains and rivers he stablished this (earth), by means of the birds and sun-motes  the air, and by means of the clouds and stars the sky.
8	1	3	He then exclaimed, 'Wealth!'--now, wealth  (mahas) means cattle, whence they (cattle) thrive (mahîyante ) exceedingly in the homestead of one who possesses many of them; and this (Sacrificer), indeed, possesses many of them, and in his homestead they do thrive exceedingly. Wherefore, if people were either to forcibly drive him from his home, or to bid him go forth, let him, after performing the Agni-hotra, approach (the fires) saying, 'Wealth'; and he becomes firmly established by offspring and cattle, and is not deprived of his home.
8	2	1	Verily, there are four kinds of fire,--the one laid down, the one taken out, the one taken forward, and the one spread (over the three hearths). Now, that which is laid down is this very (terrestrial) world; that which is taken out is the air-world, that which is taken forward is the sky, and that which is spread is the regions. And that which is laid down is Agni, that which is taken out is Vâyu (the wind), that which is taken forward is Âditya (the sun), and that which is spread is Kandramas (the moon). And that which is laid down is the Gârhapatya, that which is taken out is the Âhavanîya, that which is taken forward is the (fire) they lead forth eastwards from the Âhavanîya; and that which is spread is the one they take northwards for the cooking of the victim, and that (used) for the by-offerings : let him therefore perform the animal sacrifice on a fire taken forward.
8	3	1	Here, now, they say, 'To what deity should this victim belong?'--'It should belong to Pragâpati,' they say; 'for it was Pragâpati who first saw it: therefore it is to Pragâpati that this victim should belong.'
8	3	2	And they also say, 'To Sûrya (the sun) that victim should belong;'--whence it is that cattle are tied up when he (the sun) has set: some of themthey tie up  in their respective stables, and others just flock together:--'therefore,' they say, 'it is to Sûrya that this victim should belong.'
8	3	3	And they also say, 'To Indra and Agni that victim should belong; for behind these two deities are (all) the other gods;--if one who is afflicted sacrifices, those two (gods) sustain him; and if one sacrifices with (a desire for) abundance , they sustain him: therefore it is to Indra and Agni that this victim should belong.'
8	3	4	The animal sacrifice, indeed, is the breath, whence, as long as one lives, no other has power over his cattle, for they are tied to him.
8	3	5	Pragâpati said to Agni, 'I will perform sacrifice with thee: I will lay hands upon thee (as a victim).'--'Nay,' said he, 'speak unto man!' He said to man, 'I will perform sacrifice with thee: I will lay hands upon thee.'--'Nay,' said he, 'speak unto the cattle!' He said to the cattle, 'I will perform sacrifice with you: I will lay hands upon you.'--'Nay,' said they, 'speak unto the moon!' He said to the moon, 'I will perform sacrifice with thee: I will lay hands upon thee,'--'Nay,' said he, 'speak unto the sun!' He said to the sun, 'I will perform sacrifice with thee: I will lay hands upon thee.' 'So be it!' said he; 'but seeing that those liked it not (to be slaughtered), what, then, shall become mine that now is with these ?'--'Whatsoeverthou mayest desire,' he said.--'So be it,' he replied. He laid hands upon him, and this is that animal of his seized (for sacrifice). When slaughtered, it swelled, and by means of those Âprî-hymns, he appeased it ; and inasmuch as, by means of these Âprî-hymns, he appeased it, they are called Âprîs. And let him, for that reason, say of the slaughtered animal, 'Let it lie for a moment!' As great as the world is which he gains by performing the horse-sacrifice, so great a world does he gain by this (animal sacrifice).
8	3	6	The (wind of the) eastern region breathed over that (dead victim), saying, 'Breathe forth!' and thereby laid the breath (of the mouth) into it; the southern region breathed over it, saying, 'Breathe through!' and thereby laid the through-breathing into it; the western region breathed over it, saying, 'Breathe off!' and thereby laid the off-breathing into it; the northern region breathed over it, saying, 'Breathe up!' and thereby laid the up-breathing (of the nostrils) into it; the upper region breathed over it, saying, 'Breathe all about!' and thereby laid the circulating breathing into it. Therefore, regarding a new-born son, let him say to five Brâhmanas, before the navel-string has been cut, 'Breathe over him in this way !' But if he should be unable to obtain them he may evenhimself breathe over him whilst walking round him; and that (son of his) attains the full measure of life  and lives to old age.
8	3	7	He (the sun) took unto himself Agni's breath; whence that (fire) does not blaze unless fanned or kindled, for its breath has been taken from it; and, verily, he who knows this takes away the breath of life from his spiteful enemy.
8	3	8	He took to himself Vâyu's form; whence people hear it (the wind), as it were, shaking, but do not see it, for its form has been taken from it; and, verily, he who knows this takes away the form of his spiteful enemy.
8	3	9	He took to himself man's thought; whence people say, 'The divine thought protect thee, man's thought me!' for his thought has been taken from him; and, verily, he who knows this takes away the thought of his spiteful enemy.
8	3	10	He took to himself the eye of cattle; whence, even whilst seeing clearly, as it were, they do not know anything, but only know what it is when they smell at it, for their eye has been taken from them; and, verily, he who knows this takes away the eye of his spiteful enemy.
8	3	11	He took to himself the moon's shine; whence of these two (sun and moon), though being similar, the moon shines much less, for its shine has been taken from it; and, verily, he who knows this takes away the shine from his spiteful enemy. And inasmuch as he took these away (â-dâ), he (the sun) is called Âditya.
8	4	1	Now, once upon a time, a tiger killed the samrâg-cow  of those (who were sacrificing) with (the king of the) Kesin as their Grihapati . He (the king ) said to his fellow-sacrificers, 'What atonement is there for this?' They replied, 'There is no atonement for this: Khandika Audbhâri alone knows an atonement for it; but he certainly desires as much as this, and worse than this , (to happen) to thee.'
8	4	2	He said, 'Charioteer, put to my horses; I shall drive thither: if so be he will tell me, I shall succeed (with my sacrifice); but if he will have me die, I shall be shattered along with the shattered sacrifice.'
8	4	3	Having put to the horses, he drove off, andcame thither . When he (Khandika) saw  him, he said, 'Seeing that there are those skins on deer, we break their ribs and cook them: the skin of the black antelope is attached to my neck --is it with thoughts such as these that thou hast dared to drive over to me?'
8	4	4	'Not so,' he replied; 'a tiger has killed my samrâg-cow, reverend sir; if so be thou wilt tell me, I shall succeed; but if thou wilt have me die, I shall be shattered along with the shattered sacrifice.'
8	4	5	He said, 'I will take counsel with my counsellors .' Having called them to counsel, he said, 'If I tell him, his race, not mine, will prevail here ,but I shall gain the (other) world; and if I do not tell him, my own race, not his, will prevail here, but he will gain the (other) world.' They said, 'Do not tell him, reverend sir, for, surely, this (the earth) is the Kshatriya's world .' He replied, 'Nay, I will tell him: there are more nights  up yonder.'
8	4	6	And, accordingly, he then said to him,--'Having offered the Spritis , he (the Adhvaryu) should say, "Drive up another (cow)!" and that one should be thy samrâg-cow .'--' "From the moon I take thy mind, hail!--From the sun I take thine eye, hail!--From the wind I take thy breathings, hail!--From the regions I take thine ear, hail!--From the waters I take thy blood, hail!--From the earth I take thy body, hail!" let him then say, "Drive up another (cow)!" and that one shall be thy samrâg cow!' He then departed from thence , and, verily, members of the Kesin race are born here even to this day.
