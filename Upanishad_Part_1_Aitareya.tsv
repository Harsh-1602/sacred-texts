Aranyaka	Adhyaya	Khanda	Text_no	Hymn
1	1	1	1	Now follows the Mahâvrata ceremony.
1	1	1	2	After having killed Vritra, Indra became great. When he became great, then there was the Mahâvrata (the great work). This is why the Mahâvrata ceremony is called Mahâvrata.
1	1	1	3	Some people say: 'Let the priest make two (recitations with the offering of the) âgya (ghee) on that day,' but the right thing is one .
1	1	1	4	He who desires prosperity should use the hymn, pra vo devâyâgnaye .
1	1	1	5	He who desires increase should use the hymn, viso viso atithim .
1	1	1	6	The people (visah) indeed are increase , and therefore he (the sacrificer) becomes increased.
1	1	1	7	But (some say), there is the word atithim (in that hymn, which means a guest or stranger, asking for food). Let him not therefore take that hymn. Verily, the atithi (stranger) is able  to go begging.
1	1	1	8	'No,' he said, 'let him take that hymn.
1	1	1	9	'For he who follows the good road and obtains distinction, he is an atithi (guest) .
1	1	1	10	'They do not consider him who is not so, worthy to be (called) an atithi (guest).
1	1	1	11	'Therefore let him by all means take that hymn.'
1	1	1	12	If he takes that hymn, let him place the (second) tristich, âganma vritrahantamam, 'we came near to the victorious,' first.
1	1	1	13	For people worship the whole year (performing the Gavâmayana sacrifice) wishing for this day (the last but one)--they do come near.
1	1	1	14	The (next following) three tristichs begin with an Anushtubh . Now Brahman is Gâyatrî, speech is Anushtubh. He thus joins speech with Brahman.
1	1	1	15	He who desires glory should use the hymn, abodhy agnih samidhâ ganânâm .
1	1	1	16	He who desires offspring and cattle should use the hymn, hotâganishta ketanah .
1	1	2	1	He who desires proper food  should use the hymn, agnim naro dîdhitibhih  .
1	1	2	2	Verily, Agni (fire) is the eater of food.In the other (recitations accompanying the) offerings of âgya (where Agni is likewise mentioned) the worshippers come more slowly near to Agni (because the name of Agni does not stand at the beginning of the hymn). But here a worshipper obtains proper food at once, he strikes down evil at once.
1	1	2	3	Through the words (occurring in the second foot of the first verse), hastakyuti ganayanta, 'they caused the birth of Agni by moving their arms,' the hymn becomes endowed with (the word) birth. Verily, the sacrificer is born from this day of the sacrifice, and therefore the hymn is endowed with (the word) birth.
1	1	2	4	There are four metrical feet (in the Trishtubh verses of this hymn). Verily, cattle have four feet, therefore they serve for the gaining of cattle.
1	1	2	5	There are three metrical feet (in the Virâg, verses of this hymn). Verily, three are these three-foldworlds. Therefore they serve for the conquest of the worlds.
1	1	2	6	These (the Trishtubh and Virâg verses of the hymn) form two metres, which form a support (pratishthâ). Verily, man is supported by two (feet), cattle by four feet. Therefore this hymn places the sacrificer who stands on two feet among cattle which stand on four.
1	1	2	7	By saying them straight on there are twenty-five verses in this hymn. Man also consists of twenty-five. There are ten fingers on his hands, ten toes on his feet, two legs, two arms, and the trunk (âtman) the twenty-fifth. He adorns that trunk, the twenty-fifth, by this hymn.
1	1	2	8	And then this day (of the sacrifice) consists of twenty-five, and the Stoma hymn of that day consists of twenty-five  (verses); it becomes the same through the same. Therefore these two, the day and the hymn, are twenty-five .
1	1	2	9	These twenty-five verses, by repeating the first thrice and the last thrice, become thirty less one. This is a Virâg, verse (consisting of thirty syllables), too small by one. Into the small (heart) the vital spirits are placed, into the small stomach food is placed , therefore this Virâg, small by one, serves for the obtainment of those desires.
1	1	2	10	He who knows this, obtains those desires.
1	1	2	11	The verses (contained in the hymn agnim naro dîdhitibhih) become the Brihatî  metre andthe Virâg metre, (they become) the perfection which belongs to that day (the mahâvrata). Then they also become Anushtubh , for the offerings of âgya (ghee) dwell in Anushtubhs .
1	1	3	1	Some say: 'Let him take a Gâyatrî hymn for the Pra-uga. Verily, Gâyatrî is brightness and glory of countenance, and thus the sacrificer becomes bright and glorious.'
1	1	3	2	Others say: 'Let him take a Ushnih hymn for the Pra-uga. Verily, Ushnih is life, and thus the sacrificer has a long life.'Others say: 'Let him take an Anushtubh hymnfor the Pra-uga. Verily, Anushtubh is valour, and it serves for obtaining valour.'Others say: 'Let him take a Brihatî hymn for the Pra-uga. Verily, Brihatî is fortune, and thus the sacrificer becomes fortunate.'Others say: 'Let him take a Paṅkti hymn for the Pra-uga. Verily, Paṅkti is food, and thus the sacrificer becomes rich in food.'Others say: 'Let him take a Trishtubh hymn for the Pra-uga. Verily, Trishtubh is strength, and thus the sacrificer becomes strong.'Others say: 'Let him take a Gagatî hymn for the Pra-uga. Verily, cattle is Gagatî-like, and thus the sacrificer becomes rich in cattle.'But we say: 'Let him take a Gâyatrî hymn only. Verily, Gâyatrî is Brahman, and that day (the mahâvrata) is (for the attainment of) Brahman. Thus he obtains Brahman by means of Brahman.
1	1	3	4	'And it must be a Gâyatrî hymn by Madhukkhandas,
1	1	3	5	'For Madhukkhandas is called Madhukkhandas, because he wishes (khandati) for honey (madhu) for the Rishis.
1	1	3	6	'Now food verily is honey, all is honey, all desires are honey, and thus if he recites the hymn of Madhukkhandas, it serves for the attainment of all desires.
1	1	3	7	'He who knows this, obtains all desires.'This (Gâyatrî pra-uga), according to the one-day (ekâha) ceremonial , is perfect in form . On that day (the mahâvrata) much is done now and then whichhas to be hidden , and has to be atoned for y recitation of hymns). Atonement (sânti) is rest, the one-day sacrifice. Therefore at the end of the year (on the last day but one of the sacrifice that lasts a whole year) the sacrificers rest on this atonement as their rest.
1	1	3	8	He who knows this rests firm, and they also for whom a Hotri priest who knows this, recites this hymn.
1	1	4	1	Rv. I,
1	1	4	2	,
1	1	4	1-3	Vâyav â yâhi darsateme somâ aram kritâh, 'Approach, O Vâyu, conspicuous, these Somas have been made ready.' Because the word ready occurs in these verses, therefore is this day (of the sacrifice) ready (and auspicious) for the sacrificer and for the gods.
1	1	4	2	Yes, this day is ready (and auspicious) to him who knows this, or for whom a Hotri priest who knows this, recites.
1	1	4	3	Rv. I,
1	1	4	2	,
1	1	4	4-6	Indravâyû ime sutâ, â yâtam upa nishkritam, 'Indra and Vâyu, these Somas are prepared, come hither towards what has been prepared.' By nishkrita, prepared, he means what has been well prepared (samskrita).
1	1	4	4	Indra and Vâyu go to what has been prepared by him who knows this, or for whom a Hotri priest who knows this, recites.
1	1	4	5	Rv. I,
1	1	4	2	,
1	1	4	7	Mitram huve pûtadaksham, dhiyam ghritâkîm sâdhantâ, 'I call Mitra of holy strength; (he and Varuna) they fulfil the prayer accompanied with clarified butter.' Verily, speech is the prayer accompanied with clarified butter.
1	1	4	6	Speech is given to him who knows this, or for whom a Hotri priest who knows this, recites.
1	1	4	7	Rv. I,
1	1	4	3	,
1	1	4	1	Asvinâ yagvarîr ishah, 'O Asvinau, (eat) the sacrificial offerings.' Verily, the sacrificial offerings are food, and this serves for the acquirement of food.
1	1	4	8	Rv. I,
1	1	4	3	,
1	1	4	3	Â yâtam rudravartanî, 'Come hither, ye Rudravartanî.'
1	1	4	9	The Asvinau go to the sacrifice of him who knows this, or for whom a Hotri priest who knows this, recites.
1	1	4	10	Rv. I,
1	1	4	3	,
1	1	4	4-6	Indrâ yâhi kitrabhâno, indrâ yâhi dhiyeshitah, indrâ yâhi tûtugâna, 'Come hither, Indra, of bright splendour, Come hither, Indra, called by prayer, Come hither, Indra, quickly!' Thus he recites, Come hither, come hither!
1	1	4	11	Indra comes to the sacrifice of him who knows this, or for whom a Hotri priest who knows this, recites.
1	1	4	12	Rv. I,
1	1	4	3	,
1	1	4	7	Omâsas karshanîdhrito visve devâsa â gata, 'Visve Devas, protectors, supporters of men, come hither!'
1	1	4	13	Verily, the Visve Devas come to the call of him who knows this, or for whom a Hotri priest who knows this, recites.
1	1	4	14	Rv. I,
1	1	4	3	,
1	1	4	7	Dâsvâmso dâsushah sutam, 'Come ye givers to the libation of the giver!' By dâsushah he means dadushah, i. e. to the libation of every one that gives.
1	1	4	15	The gods fulfil his wish, with whatever wish he recites this verse,
1	1	4	16	(The wish of him) who knows this, or for whom a Hotri priest who knows this, recites.
1	1	4	17	Rv. I,
1	1	4	3	,
1	1	4	10	Pâvakâ nah sarasvatî yagñam vashtu dhiyâvasuh, 'May the holy Sarasvatî accept our sacrifice, rich in prayer!' Speech is meant by 'rich in prayer.'
1	1	4	18	Speech is given to him who knows this, or for whom a Hotri priest who knows this, recites.
1	1	4	19	And when he says, 'May she accept our sacrifice!' what he means is, 'May she carry off our sacrifice!'
1	1	4	20	If these verses are recited straight on, they are twenty-one. Man also consists of twenty-one. There are ten fingers on his hands, ten toes on his feet, and the trunk the twenty-first. He adorns that trunk, the twenty-first, by this hymn .
1	1	4	21	By repeating the first and the last verses thrice, they become twenty-five. The trunk is the twenty-fifth, and Pragâpati is the twenty-fifth. There are ten fingers on his hands, ten toes on his feet, two legs, two arms, and the trunk the twenty-fifth. He adorns that trunk, the twenty-fifth, by this hymn'.Now this day consists of twenty-five, and the Stoma hymn of that day consists of twenty-five: it becomes the same through the same. Therefore these two, the day and the hymn, are twenty-five, yea, twenty-five.
1	2	1	1	The two trikas, Rv. VIII,
1	2	1	68	,
1	2	1	1-3	, â tvâ ratham yathotaye, and Rv. VIII,
1	2	1	2	,
1	2	1	1-3	, idam vaso sutam andhah, form the first (pratipad) and the second (anukara) of the Marutvatîya hymn.
1	2	1	2	Both, as belonging to the one-day ceremonial , are perfect in form. On that day much is done now and then which has to be hidden, and has to be atoned for. Atonement is rest, the one-day sacrifice. Therefore at the end of the year the sacrificers rest on this atonement as their rest. He who knows this rests firm, and they also for whom a Hotri priest who knows this, recites this hymn .
1	2	1	3	In the second verse of (the Pragâtha ), indra nedîya ed ihi, pra sû tirâ sakîbhir ye ta ukthinah , there occurs the word ukthinah, reciters of hymns . Verily, this day (the mahâvrata) is an uktha (hymn), and as endowed with an uktha, the form of this day is perfect.
1	2	1	4	In the first verse (of another Pragâtha) the word vîra, strong, occurs , and as endowed with the word vîra, strong, the form of this day is perfect.
1	2	1	5	In the second verse (of another Pragâtha) the word suvîryam, strength, occurs , and as endowed with the word suvîrya, strength, the form of this day is perfect.
1	2	1	6	In the first verse (of another Pragâtha) the word ukthyam, to be hymned, occurs . Verily, this day is an uktha, and as endowed with an uktha, the form of this day is perfect.
1	2	1	7	In the (Dhayyâ) verse agnir netâ  the word vritrahâ, killer of Vritra, occurs. The killing of Vritra is a form (character) of Indra, this day (the mahâvrata) belongs to Indra, and this is the (perfect) form of that day.
1	2	1	8	In the (Dhayyâ) verse tvam soma kratubhih sukratur bhûh  the word vrishâ , powerful, occurs. Powerful is a form (character) of Indra, this day belongs to Indra, and this is the (perfect) form of that day.
1	2	1	9	In the (Dhayyâ) verse pinvanty apah  the word vâginam, endowed with food, occurs. Endowed with food is a form (character) of Indra, this day belongs to Indra, and this is the (perfect) form of that day.
1	2	1	10	In the same verse the word stanayantam, thundering, occurs. Endowed with thundering is a form (character) of Indra, this day belongs to Indra, and this is the (perfect) form of that day.
1	2	1	11	In (the Pragâtha) pra va indrâya brihate  (the word brihat occurs). Verily, brihat is mahat (great), and as endowed with mahat, great, the form of this day (mahâvrata) is perfect.
1	2	1	12	In (the Pragâtha) brihad indrâya gâyata [paragraph continues] (the word brihat occurs). Verily, brihat is mahat (great), and as endowed with mahat, the form of this day is perfect.
1	2	1	13	In (the Pragâtha) nakih sudâso ratham pary âsa na rîramad  the words paryâsa (he moved round) and na rîramad (he did not enjoy) occur, and as endowed with the words paryasta and rânti the form of this day is perfect .He recites all (these) Pragâthas, in order to obtain all the days (of the sacrifice), all the Ukthas , all the Prishthas , all the Sastras , all the Pra-ugas , and all the Savanas (libations).
1	2	2	1	He recites the hymn, asat su me garitah sâbhivegah , (and in. it the word) satyadhvritam, the destroyer of truth. Verily, that dayis truth, and as endowed with the word satya, truth, the form of this day is perfect .
1	2	2	2	That hymn is composed by Vasukra. Verily, Vasukra is Brahman, and that day is Brahman. Thus he obtains Brahman by means of Brahman .
1	2	2	3	Here they say: 'Why then is that Marutvatîya, hymn completed by the hymn of Vasukra?' Surely because no other Rishi but Vasukra brought out a Marutvatîya hymn, or divided it properly . Therefore that Marutvatîya hymn is completed by the hymn of Vasukra.
1	2	2	4	That hymn, asat su me, is not definitely addressed to any deity, and is therefore supposed to be addressed to Pragâpati. Verily, Pragâpati is indefinite, and therefore the hymn serves to win Pragâpati.
1	2	2	5	Once in the hymn  he defines Indra (indrâya sunvat); therefore it does not fall off from its form, as connected with Indra.
1	2	2	6	He recites the hymn  pibâ somam abhi yam ugra tardah.
1	2	2	7	In the verse ûrvam gavyam mahi grinâna indra the word mahi, great, occurs. Endowed with the word mahat, the form of this day is perfect.
1	2	2	8	That hymn is composed by Bharadvâga, and Bharadvâga was he who knew most, who lived longest, and performed the greatest austerities among the Rishis, and by this hymn he drove away evil. Therefore if he recites the hymn of Bharadvâga,then, after having driven away evil, he becomes learned, long-lived, and full of austerities.
1	2	2	9	He recites the hymn kayâ subhâ savayasah sanîlâh .
1	2	2	10	In the verse â sâsate prati haryanty ukthâ  the word uktha occurs. Verily, that day (the mahâvrata) is uktha (hymn). Endowed with the word uktha, the form of this day becomes perfect.
1	2	2	11	That hymn is called Kayâsubhîya . Verily, that hymn, which is called Kayâsubhîya, is mutual understanding and it is lasting. By means of it Indra, Agastya, and the Maruts came to a mutual understanding. Therefore, if he recites the Kayâsubhîya hymn, it serves for mutual understanding.
1	2	2	12	The same hymn is also long life. Therefore, if the sacrificer is dear to the Hotri, let him recite the Kayâsubhîya hymn for him.
1	2	2	13	He recites the hymn marutvân indra vrishabo ranâya .
1	2	2	14	In it the words indra vrishabha (powerful) occur. Verily, powerful is a form of Indra , this day belongs to Indra, and this is the perfect form of that day.
1	2	2	15	That hymn is composed by Visvâmitra. Verily, Visvâmitra was the friend (mitra) of all (visva).
1	2	2	16	Everybody is the friend of him who knows this, and for whom a Hotri priest who knows this, recites this hymn.
1	2	2	17	The next hymn, ganishthâ ugrah sahase turâya , forms a Nividdhâna , and,according to the one-day (ekâha) ceremonial, is perfect in form. On that day much is done now and then which has to be hidden, and has to be atoned for (by recitation of hymns). Atonement is rest, the one-day sacrifice. Therefore at the end of the year (on the last day but one of the sacrifice that lasts a whole year) the sacrificers rest on this atonement as their rest.He who knows this rests firm, and they also for whom a Hotri priest who knows this, recites this hymn .
1	2	2	18	These, if recited straight on, are ninety-seven verses . The ninety are three Virâg, each consisting of thirty, and then the seven verses which are over. Whatever is the praise of the seven, is the praise of ninety also.
1	2	2	19	By repeating the first and last verses three times each, they become one hundred and one verses.
1	2	2	20	There are five fingers, of four joints each, two pits (in the elbow and the arm), the arm, the eye, the shoulder-blade; this makes twenty-five. The other three parts have likewise twenty-five each . That makes a hundred, and the trunk is the one hundred and first.
1	2	2	21	Hundred is life, health, strength, brightness. The sacrificer as the one hundred and first rests in life, health, strength, and brightness.
1	2	2	22	These verses become Trishtubh , for the noonday-libation consists of Trishtubh verses.
1	2	3	1	They say: 'What is the meaning of preṅkha, swing?' Verily, he is the swing, who blows (the wind). He indeed goes forward (pra + iṅkhate) in these worlds, and that is why the swing is called preṅkha.
1	2	3	2	Some say, that there should be one plank, because the wind blows in one way, and it should be like the wind.
1	2	3	3	That is not to be regarded.
1	2	3	4	Some say, there should be three planks, because there are these three threefold worlds, and it should be like them.
1	2	3	5	That is not to be regarded.
1	2	3	6	Let there be two, for these two worlds (the earth and heaven) are seen as if most real, while the ether (space) between the two is the sky (antariksha). Therefore let there be two planks.
1	2	3	7	Let them be made of Udumbara wood. Verily, the Udumbara tree is sap and eatable food, and thus it serves to obtain sap and eatable food.
1	2	3	8	Let them be elevated in the middle (between the earth and the cross-beam). Food, if placed in the middle, delights man, and thus he places the sacrificer in the middle of eatable food.
1	2	3	9	There are two kinds of rope, twisted towards the right and twisted towards the left. The right ropes serve for some animals, the left ropes for others. If there are both kinds of rope, they serve for the attainment of both kinds of cattle.
1	2	3	10	Let them be made of Darbha (Kusa grass), for among plants Darbha is free from evil, therefore they should be made of Darbha grass.
1	2	4	1	Some say: 'Let the swing be one ell (aratni) above the ground, for by that measure verily the Svarga worlds are measured.' That is not to be regarded.
1	2	4	2	Others say: 'Let it be one span (prâdesa), for by that measure verily the vital airs were measured.' That is not to be regarded .
1	2	4	3	Let it be one fist (mushti), for by that measure verily all eatable food is made, and by that measureall eatable food is taken; therefore let it be one fist above the ground.
1	2	4	4	They say: 'Let him mount the swing from east to west, like he who shines; for the sun mounts these worlds from east to west.' That is not to be regarded.
1	2	4	5	Others say: 'Let him mount the swing sideways, for people mount a horse sideways , thinking that thus they will obtain all desires.' That is not to be regarded.
1	2	4	6	They say: 'Let him mount the swing  from behind, for people mount a ship from behind, and this swing is a ship in which to go to heaven.' Therefore let him mount it from behind.
1	2	4	7	Let him touch the swing with his chin (khubuka). The parrot (suka) thus mounts a tree, and he is of all birds the one who eats most food. Therefore let him touch it with his chin.
1	2	4	8	Let him mount the swing with his arms . The hawk swoops thus on birds and on trees, and he is of all birds the strongest. Therefore let him mount with his arms.
1	2	4	9	Let him not withdraw one foot (the right or left) from the earth, for fear that he may lose his hold.
1	2	4	10	The Hotri mounts the swing, the Udgâtri the seat made of Udumbara wood. The swing is masculine, the seat feminine, and they form a union. Thus he makes a union at the beginning of the uktha in order to get offspring.He who knows this, gets offspring and cattle.
1	2	4	12	Next the swing is food, the seat fortune. Thus he mounts and obtains food and fortune.
1	2	4	13	The Hotrakas (the Prasâstri, Brâhmanâkkhamsin, Potri, Neshtri, Agnâdhra, and Akkhâvâka) together with the Brahman sit down on cushions made of grass, reeds, leaves, &c.
1	2	4	14	Plants and trees, after they have grown up, bear fruit. Thus if the priests mount on that day altogether (on their seats), they mount on solid and fluid as their proper food. Therefore this serves for the attainment of solid as proper food .
1	2	4	15	Some say: 'Let him descend after saying vashat . 'That is not to be regarded. For, verily, that respect is not shown which is shown to one who does not see it .
1	2	4	16	Others say: 'Let him descend after he has taken the food in his hand.' That is not to be regarded. For, verily, that respect is not shown which is shown to one after he has approached quite close.
1	2	4	17	Let him descend after he has seen the food. For, verily, that is real respect which is shown to one when he sees it. Only after having actuallyseen the food (that is brought to the sacrifice), let him descend from the swing.
1	2	4	18	Let him descend turning towards the east, for in the east the seed of the gods springs up . Therefore let him rise turning towards the east, yea, turning towards the east.
1	3	1	1	Let him begin this day  with singing 'Him,' thus they say.
1	3	1	2	Verily, the sound Him is Brahman, that day also is Brahman. He who knows this, obtains Brahman even by Brahman.
1	3	1	3	As he begins with the sound Him, surely that masculine sound of Him and the feminine Rik (the verse) make a couple. Thus he makes a couple at the beginning of the hymn in order to get offspring . He who knows this, gets cattle and offspring.
1	3	1	4	Or, as he begins with the sound Him, surely like a wooden spade, so the sound Him serves to dig up Brahman (the sap of the Veda). And as a man wishes to dig up any, even the hardest soil, with a spade, thus he digs up Brahman.
1	3	1	5	He who knows this digs up, by means of the sound Him, everything he may desire.
1	3	1	6	If he begins with the sound Him, that sound is the holding apart of divine and human speech.Therefore, he who begins, after having uttered the sound Him, holds apart divine and human speech .
1	3	2	1	And here they ask: 'What is the beginning of this day?' Let him say: 'Mind and speech .'
1	3	2	2	All desires dwell in the one (mind), the other yields all desires.
1	3	2	3	All desires dwell in the mind, for with the mind he conceives all desires.
1	3	2	4	All desires come to him who knows this.
1	3	2	5	Speech yields all desires, for with speech he declares all his desires.
1	3	2	6	Speech yields all desires to him who knows this.
1	3	2	7	Here they say: 'Let him not begin this day with a Rik, a Yagus, or a Sâman verse (divine speech), for it is said, he should not start with a Rik, a Yagus, or a Sâman .'
1	3	2	8	Therefore, let him say these Vyâhritis (sacred interjections) first.
1	3	2	9	These interjections Bhûs, Bhuvas, Svar are the three Vedas, Bhûs the Rig-veda, Bhuvas the Yagur-veda, Svar the Sâma-veda. Therefore (byintercalating these) he does not begin simply with a Rik, Yagus, or Sâman verse, he does not start with a Rik, Yagus, or Sâman verse.
1	3	3	1	He begins with tad, this, (the first word of the first hymn, tad id âsa). Verily 'this, this' is food, and thus he obtains food.
1	3	3	2	Pragâpati indeed uttered this as the first word, consisting of one or two syllables, viz. tata and tâta (or tat) . And thus does a child, as soon as he begins to speak, utter the word, consisting of one or two syllables, viz. tata and tâta (or tat). With this very word, consisting of tat or tatta, he begins.
1	3	3	3	This has been said by a Rishi  :--
1	3	3	4	'O Brihaspati, the first point of speech;'--for this is the first and highest point of speech.
1	3	3	5	'That which you have uttered, making it a name;'--for names are made by speech.
1	3	3	6	'That (name) which was the best and without a flaw;'--for this is the best and without a flaw.
1	3	3	7	'That which was hidden by their love, is made manifest;'--for this was hidden in the body, viz. those deities (which enter the body, Agni as voice, entering the mouth, &c.); and that was manifest among the gods in heaven. This is what was intended by the verse.
1	3	4	1	He begins with: 'That indeed was the oldest in the worlds ;'--for that (the Brahman) is verily the oldest in the worlds.
1	3	4	2	'Whence was born the fierce one, endowed with brilliant force;'--for from it was born the fierce one, who is endowed with brilliant force.
1	3	4	3	'When born he at once destroys the enemies;'--for he at once when born struck down the evil one.
1	3	4	4	'He after whom all friends rejoice;'--verily all friends are the creatures, and they rejoice after him, saying, 'He has risen, he has risen .'
1	3	4	5	'Growing by strength, the almighty ;'--for he (the sun) does grow by strength, the almighty.
1	3	4	6	'He, as enemy, causes fear to the slave;'--for everything is afraid of him.
1	3	4	7	'Taking the breathing and the not-breathing;'--this means the living and the lifeless.
1	3	4	8	'Whatever has been offered at feasts came to thee;'--this means everything is in thy power.
1	3	4	9	'All turn their thought also on thee ;'--thismeans all these beings, all minds, all thoughts also turn to thee.
1	3	4	10	'When these two become three protectors;'--i. e. when these two united beget offspring.
1	3	4	11	He who knows this, gets offspring and cattle.
1	3	4	12	'Join what is sweeter than sweet (offspring) with the sweet (the parents);'--for the couple (father and mother) is sweet, the offspring is sweet, and he thus joins the offspring with the couple.
1	3	4	13	'And this (the son, when married) being very sweet, conquered through the sweet;'--i. e. the couple is sweet, the offspring is sweet, and thus through the couple he conquers offspring .
1	3	4	14	This is declared by a Rishi : 'Because he (Pragâpati) raised his body (the hymn tad id âsa or the Veda in general) in the body (of the sacrificer)' (therefore that Nishkevalya hymn is praised);--i. e. this body, consisting of the Veda, in that corporeal form (of the sacrificer).
1	3	4	15	'Then let this body indeed be the medicine of that body;'--i. e. this body, consisting of the Veda, of that corporeal form (of the sacrificer).
1	3	4	16	Of this  the eight syllables are Gâyatrî, the eleven syllables are Trishtubh, the twelve syllables are Gagatî, the ten syllables are Virâg. The Virâg, consisting of ten syllables, rests in these three metres .
1	3	4	17	The word purusha, consisting of three syllables, that indeed goes into the Virâg .
1	3	4	18	Verily, these are all metres, these (Gâyatrî, Trishtubh, Gagatî) having the Virâg as the fourth. In this manner this day is complete in all metres to him who knows this.
1	3	5	1	He extends these (verses) by (interpolating) the sound . Verily, the sound is purusha, man. Therefore every man when he speaks, sounds loud, as it were.
1	3	5	2	At the end of each foot of the first verse of the hymn tad id âsa, he inserts one foot of the second verse of hymn Rv. VIII,
1	3	5	69	, nadam va odatînâm, &c. Thus the verse is to be recited as follows:Tad id âsa bhuvaneshu gyeshtham pu     nadam va odatînâm, Yato gagña ugras tveshanrimno ru     nadam yoyuvatînâm, Sadyo gagñâno ni rinâti satrûn     patim vo aghnyânâm, Anu yam visve madanti ûmâh sho     dhenûnâm ishudhyasi.In nadam va odatînâm , odati  are the waters in heaven, for they water all this; and they are the waters in the mouth, for they water all good food.
1	3	5	3	In nadam yoyuvatînâm , yoyuvatî are the waters in the sky, for they seem to inundate; and they are the waters of perspiration, for they seem to run continually.
1	3	5	4	In patim vo aghnyânâm , aghnyâ are the waters which spring from the smoke of fire, and they are the waters which spring from the organ.
1	3	5	5	In dhenûnâm ishudhyasi , the dhenu (cows) are the waters, for they delight all this; and ishudhyasi means, thou art food.
1	3	5	6	He extends a Trishtubh and an Anushtubh . Trishtubh is the man, Anushtubh the wife, and they make a couple. Therefore does a man, after having found a wife, consider himself a more perfect man.
1	3	5	7	These verses, by repeating the first three times, become twenty-five. The trunk is the twenty-fifth, and Pragâpati is the twenty-fifth . There are ten fingers on his hands, ten toes on his feet, two legs, two arms, and the trunk the twenty-fifth. He adorns that trunk as the twenty-fifth. Now this day consists of twenty-five, and the Stoma hymn of that day consists of twenty-five: it becomes the samethrough the same. Therefore the two, the day and the hymn, are twenty-five .
1	3	7	1	He begins with the hymn, Tad id âsa, bhuvaneshu gyeshtham . Verily, gyeshtha, the oldest, is mahat, great. Endowed with mahat the form of this day is perfect.
1	3	7	2	Then follows the hymn, Tâm su te kîrtim maghavan mahitvâ , with the auspicious word mahitvâ.
1	3	7	3	Then follows the hymn, Bhûya id vavridhe vîryâya , with the auspicious word vîrya.
1	3	7	4	Then follows the hymn, Nrinâm u tvâ nritamam gobhir ukthaih , with the auspicious word uktha.
1	3	7	5	He extends the first two pâdas, which are too small, by one syllable  . Into the small heart the vital spirits are placed, into the small stomach food is placed. Itserves for the attainment of these desires. He who knows this, obtains these desires.
1	3	7	6	The two feet, each consisting of ten syllables , serve for the gaining of both kinds of food , of what has feet (animal food), and what has no feet (vegetable food).
1	3	7	7	They come to be of eighteen syllables each . Of those which are ten, nine are the prânas (openings of the body) , the tenth is the (vital) self. This is the perfection of the (vital) self; Eight syllables remain in each. He who knows them, obtains whatever he desires.
1	3	8	1	He extends (these verses) by (interpolating) the sound . Verily, breath (prâna) is sound. Therefore every breath when it sounds, sounds loud, as it were.
1	3	8	2	The verse  nadam va odatînâm, &c., is by its syllables an Ushnih , by its feet an Anushtubh . Ushnih is life, Anushtubh, speech. He thus places life and speech in him (the sacrificer.)
1	3	8	3	By repeating the first verse three times, theybecome twenty-five. The trunk is the twenty-fifth, and Pragâpati is the twenty-fifth. There are ten fingers on his hands, ten toes on his feet, two legs, two arms, and the trunk the twenty-fifth. He adorns that trunk as the twenty-fifth. Now this day consists of twenty-five, and the Stoma hymn of that day consists of twenty-five: it becomes the same through the same. Therefore the two, the day and the hymn, are twenty-five. This is the twenty-fifth with regard to the body.
1	3	8	4	Next, with regard to the deities: The eye, the ear, the mind, speech, and breath, these five deities (powers) have entered into that person (purusha), and that person entered into the five deities. He is wholly pervaded there with his limbs to the very hairs and nails. Therefore all beings to the very insects are born as pervaded (by the deities or senses) .
1	3	8	5	This has been declared by a Rishi :--
1	3	8	6	'A thousandfold are these fifteen hymns;'--for five arise from ten .
1	3	8	7	'As large as heaven and earth, so large is it;'--verily, the self (gîvâtman) is as large as heaven and earth.
1	3	8	8	'A thousandfold are the thousand powers ;'--by saying this the poet pleases the hymns (the senses), and magnifies them.
1	3	8	9	'As far as Brahman reaches, so far reaches speech;'--wherever there is Brahman, there is a word; and wherever there is a word, there is Brahman, this was intended.
1	3	8	10	The first of the hymns among all those hymns has nine verses. Verily, there are nine prânas (openings), and it serves for their benefit.
1	3	8	11	Then follows a hymn of six verses. Verily, the seasons are six, and it serves to obtain them.
1	3	8	12	Then follows a hymn of five verses. Verily' the Paṅkti consists of five feet. Verily, Paṅkti is food, and it serves for the gaining of proper food.
1	3	8	13	Then follows a tristich. Three are these threefold worlds, and it serves to conquer them.
1	3	8	14	These verses become Brihatîs , that metre being immortal, leading to the world of the Devas. That body of verses is the trunk (of the bird represented by the whole sastra), and thus it is. He who knows this comes by this way (by making the verses the trunk of the bird) near to the immortal Self, yea, to the immortal Self .
1	4	1	1	Next comes the Sûdadohas  verse. Sûdadohas is breath, and thereby he joins all joints with breath.
1	4	1	2	Next follow the neck verses. They recite them as Ushnih, according to their metre .
1	4	1	3	Next comes (again) the Sûdadohas verse. Sûdadohas is breath, and thereby he joins all joints with breath.
1	4	1	4	Next follows the head. That is in Gâyatrî verses. The Gâyatrî is the beginning of all metres ; the head the first of all members. It is in Arkavat verses  . Arka is Agni. They are nine verses. The head consists of nine pieces. He recites the tenth verse, and that is the skin and the hairs on the head. It serves for reciting one verse more than (the nine verses contained in) the Stoma .[paragraph continues] These form the Trivrit Stoma and the Gâyatrî metre, and whatever there exists, all this is produced after the production of this Stoma and this metre. Therefore the recitation of these head-hymns serves for production.
1	4	1	5	He who knows this, gets offspring and cattle.
1	4	1	6	Next comes the Sûdadohas verse. Verily, Sûdadohas is breath, and thereby he joins all joints with breath.
1	4	1	7	Next follow the vertebrae  (of the bird). These verses are Virâg (shining). Therefore man says to man, 'Thou shinest above us;' or to a stiff and proud man, 'Thou carriest thy neck stiff.' Or because the (vertebrae of the neck) run close together, they are taken to be the best food. For Virâg, is food, and food is strength.
1	4	1	8	Next comes the Sûdadohas verse. Sûdadohas is breath, and thereby he joins all joints with breath.
1	4	2	1	Next follows the right wing. It is this world (the earth), it is this Agni, it is speech, it is the Rathantara , it is Vasishtha, it is a hundred . These are the six powers (of the right wing) . The Sampâta hymn  serves indeed for obtaining desires and for firmness. The Paṅkti verse  serves for proper food.
1	4	2	2	Next comes the Sûdadohas verse. Sûdadohas is breath, thereby he joins all joints with breath.
1	4	2	3	Next follows the left wing. It is that world (heaven), it is that sun, it is mind, it is the Brihat, ita, it is a hundred . These are the six powers (of the left wing). The Sampâta hymn  serves indeed for obtaining desires and for firmness. The Paṅkti verse  serves for proper food.
1	4	2	4	These two (the right and the left wings) are deficient and excessive . The Brihat (the left wing) is man, the Rathantara (the right wing) is woman. The excess belongs to the man, the deficiency to the woman. Therefore they are deficient and excessive.
1	4	2	5	Now the left wing of a bird is verily by one feather better, therefore the left wing is larger by one verse.
1	4	2	6	Next comes the Sûdadohas verse. Sûdadohas is breath, and thereby he joins all joints with breath.
1	4	2	7	Next follows the tail. They are twenty-one Dvipadâ verses . For there are twenty-one backward feathers in a bird.
1	4	2	8	Then the Ekavimsa is the support of all Stomas, and the tail the support of all birds .
1	4	2	9	He recites a twenty-second verse. This is made the form of two supports. Therefore all birds support themselves on their tail, and having supported themselves on their tail, they fly up. For the tail is a support.
1	4	2	10	He (the bird and the hymn) is supported by two decades which are Virâg. The man (the sacrificer) is supported by the two Dvipadâs, the twenty first and twenty-second. That which forms the bird serves for the attainment of all desires; that which forms the man, serves for his happiness, glory, proper food, and honour.
1	4	2	11	Next comes a Sûdadohas verse, then a Dhayyâ, then a Sûdadohas verse. The Sûdadohas is a man, the Dhayyâ a woman, therefore he recites the Dhayyâ as embraced on both sides by the Sûdadohas. Therefore does the seed of both, when it is effused, obtain oneness, and this with regard to thewoman only. Hence birth takes place in and from the woman. Therefore he recites that Dhayyâ in that place .
1	4	3	1	He recites the eighty tristichs of Gâyatrîs . Verily, the eighty Gâyatrî tristichs are this world (earth). Whatever there is in this world of glory, greatness, wives, food, and honour, may I obtain it, may I win it, may it be mine.
1	4	3	2	Next comes the Sûdadohas verse. Sûdadohas verily is breath. He joins this world with breath.
1	4	3	3	He recites the eighty tristichs of Brihatîs. Verily, the eighty Brihatî tristichs are the world of the sky. Whatever there is in the world of the sky of glory, greatness, wives, food, and honour, may I obtain it, may I win it, may it be mine.
1	4	3	4	Next comes the Sûdadohas verse. Sûdadohas verily is breath. He joins the world of the sky with breath.
1	4	3	5	He recites the eighty tristichs of Ushnih. Verily, the eighty Ushnih tristichs are that world, the heaven. Whatever there is in that world of glory, greatness, wives, food, and honour, also the divine being of the Devas (Brahman), may I obtain it, may I win it, may it be mine.
1	4	3	6	Next comes the Sûdadohas verse. Sûdadohas verily is the breath. He joins that world with breath, yea, with breath.
1	5	1	1	He recites the Vasa hymn , wishing, May everything be in my power.
1	5	1	2	They (its verses) are twenty-one , for twenty-one are the parts (the lungs, spleen, &c.) in the belly.
1	5	1	3	Then the Ekavimsa is verily the support of all Stomas, and the belly the support of all food.
1	5	1	4	They consist of different metres. Verily, the intestines are confused, some small, some large.
1	5	1	5	He recites them with the pranava , according to the metre , and according to rule . Verily, the intestines are according to rule, as it were; some shorter, some longer.
1	5	1	6	Next comes the Sûdadohas verse. Sûdadohas verily is breath. He joins the joints; with breath.
1	5	1	7	After having recited that verse twelve times heleaves it off there. These prânas are verily twelvefold, seven in the head, two on the breast, three below. In these twelve places the prânas are contained, there they are perfect. Therefore he leaves it off there .
1	5	1	8	The hymn indrâgnî yuvam su nah  forms the two thighs (of the bird) belonging to Indra and Agni, the two supports with broad bones.
1	5	1	9	These (verses) consist of six feet, so that they may stand firm. Man stands firm on two feet, animals on four. He thus places man (the sacrificer), standing on two feet, among four-footed cattle.
1	5	1	10	The second verse has seven feet, and he makes it into a Gâyatrî and Anushtubh. Gâyatrî is Brahman, Anushtubh is speech; and he thus puts together speech with Brahman.
1	5	1	11	He recites a Trishtubh at the end. Trishtubh is strength, and thus does he come round animals by strength. Therefore animals come near where there is strength (of command, &c.); they come to be roused and to rise up, (they obey the commands of a strong shepherd.)
1	5	2	1	When he recites the Nishkevalya hymn addressed to Indra , pra vo mahe, he inserts a Nivid  (between the fourth and fifth verses). Thus he clearly places strength in himself (in the sastra, in the bird, in himself).
1	5	2	2	They are Trishtubhs and Gagatîs.
1	5	2	3	There they say: 'Why does he insert a Nivid among mixed Trishtubhs and Gagatîs ?' But surely one metre would never support the Nivid of this day, nor fill it: therefore he inserts the Nivid among mixed Trishtubhs and Gagatîs.
1	5	2	4	Let him know that this day has three Nivids: the Vasa hymn is a Nivid, the Vâlakhilyas  are a Nivid, and the Nivid itself is a Nivid. Thus let him know that day as having three Nivids.
1	5	2	5	Then follow the hymns vane na vâ  and yo gâta eva . In the fourth verse of the former hymn occur the words anne samasya yad asan manîshâh, and they serve for the winning of proper food.
1	5	2	6	Then comes an insertion. As many Trishtubh and Gagatî verses , taken from the ten Mandalas and addressed to Indra, as they insert (between the two above-mentioned hymns), after changing them into Brihatîs, so many years do they live beyond the (usual) age (of one hundred years). By this insertion age is obtained.
1	5	2	7	After that he recites the Saganîya hymn, wishing that cattle may always come to his offspring.
1	5	2	8	Then he recites the Târkshya hymn . Târkshya is verily welfare, and the hymn leads to welfare. Thus (by reciting the hymn) he fares well .
1	5	2	9	Then he recites the Ekapadâ (indro visvam vi râgati), wishing, May I be everything at once, and may I thus finish the whole work of metres .
1	5	2	10	In reciting the hymn indram visvâ avivridhan  he intertwines the first seven verses by intertwining their feet . There are seven prânas (openings) in the head, and he thus places seven prânas in the head. The eighth verse (half-verse) he does not intertwine . The eighth is speech, and he thinks, May my speech never be intertwined with the other prânas. Speech therefore, though dwelling in the same abode as the other prânas, is not intertwined with them.
1	5	2	11	He recites the Virâg verses . Verily, Virâg verses are food, and they thus serve for the gaining of food.
1	5	2	12	He ends with the hymn of Vasishtha , wishing, May I be Vasishtha!
1	5	2	13	But let him end with the fifth verse, esha stomo maha ugrâya vâhe, which, possessing the word mahat, is auspicious.
1	5	2	14	In the second foot of the fifth verse the word dhuri occurs. Verily, dhuh (the place where the horse is fastened to the car) is the end (of the car). This day also is the end (of the sacrifice which lasts a whole year) . Thus the verse is fit for the day.
1	5	2	15	In the third foot the word arka is auspicious.
1	5	2	16	The last foot is: 'Make our glory high as heaven over heaven.' Thus wherever Brahmanic speech is uttered, there his glory will be, when he who knows this finishes with that verse. Therefore let a man who knows this, finish (the Nishkevalya) with that verse.
1	5	3	1	Tat savitur vrinîmahe  and adyâ no deva savitar  are the beginning (pratipad) and the next step (anukara) of the Vaisvadeva hymn, taken from the Ekâha ceremonial and therefore proper .
1	5	3	2	On that day  much is done now and then which has to be hidden, and has to be atoned for. Atonement is rest, the one-day sacrifice. Therefore at the end of the year the sacrificers; rest on this atonement as their rest. He who knows this rests firm, and they also for whom a Hotri priest who knows this, recites this hymn.
1	5	3	3	Then (follows) the hymn addressed to Savitri, tad devasya savitur vâryam mahat . Verily, mahat, great, (in this foot) is the end . This day too is the end. Thus the verse is fit for the day.
1	5	3	4	The hymn katarâ pûrvâ katarâ parâyoh , addressed to Dyâvâprithivî, is one in which many verses have the same ending. Verily, this day also (the mahâvrata) is one in which many receive the same reward . Thus it is fit for the day.
1	5	3	5	The hymn anasvo gâto anabhîsur ukthyah  is addressed to the Ribhus.
1	5	3	6	In the first verse the word tri (kakrah) occurs, and trivat  is verily the end. This day also is the end (of the sacrifice). Thus the verse is fit for the day.
1	5	3	7	The hymn asya vâmasya palitasya hotuh , addressed to the Visvedevas, is multiform. This day also is multiform . Thus the verse is fit for the day.
1	5	3	8	He recites the end of it, beginning with gaurîr mimâya .
1	5	3	9	The hymn â no bhadrâh kratavo yantu visvatah , addressed to the Visvedevas, forms the Nividdhâna, taken from the Ekâha ceremonial, and therefore proper.
1	5	3	10	On that day much is done now and then which has to be hidden, and has to be atoned for. Atonement is rest, the one-day sacrifice. Therefore at the end of the year the sacrificers rest on this atonement as their rest. He who knows this rests firm, and they also for whom a Hotri priest who knows this, recites this hymn.
1	5	3	11	The hymn vaisvânarâya dhishanâm ritavridhe[paragraph continues]  forms the beginning of the Âgnimâruta. Dhishanâ, thought, is verily the end, this day also is the end. Thus it is fit for the day.
1	5	3	12	The hymn prayagyavo maruto bhrâgadrishtayah , addressed to the Maruts, is one in which many verses have the same ending. Verily, this day also is one in which many receive the same reward. Thus it is fit for the day .
1	5	3	13	He recites the verse gâtavedase sunavâma somam , addressed to Gâtavedas, before the (next following) hymn. That verse addressed to Gâtavedas is verily welfare, and leads to welfare. Thus (by reciting it) he fares well .
1	5	3	14	The hymn imam stomam arhate gâtavedase , addressed to Gâtavedas, is one in which many verses have the same ending. Verily, this day also (the mahâvrata) is one in which many receive the same reward. Thus it is fit for the day, yea, it is fit for the day.
2	1	2	1	People say: 'Uktha, uktha,' hymns, hymns! (without knowing what uktha, hymn , means.) Thehymn is truly (to be considered as) the earth, for from it all whatsoever exists arises.
2	1	2	2	The object of its praise is Agni (fire), and the eighty verses (of the hymn) are food, for by means of food one obtains everything.
2	1	2	3	The hymn is truly the sky, for the birds fly along the sky, and men drive following the sky. The object of its praise is Vâyu (air), and the eighty verses (of the hymn) are food, for by means of food one obtains everything.
2	1	2	4	The hymn is truly the heaven, for from its gift (rain) all whatsoever exists arises. The object of its praise is Âditya (the sun), and the eighty verses are food, for by means of food one obtains everything.
2	1	2	5	So much with reference to the gods (mythological); now with reference to man (physiological).
2	1	2	6	The hymn is truly man. He is great, he is Pragâpati. Let him think, I am the hymn.
2	1	2	7	The hymn is his mouth, as before in the case of the earth.
2	1	2	8	The object of its praise is speech, and the eighty verses (of the hymn) are food, for by means of food he obtains everything.
2	1	2	9	The hymn is the nostrils, as before in the case of the sky.
2	1	2	10	The object of its praise is breath, and the eighty verses (of the hymn) are food, for by means of food he obtains everything.
2	1	2	11	The slight bent (at the root) of the nose is, as it were, the place of the brilliant (Âditya, the sun).
2	1	2	12	The hymn is the forehead, as before in the case of heaven. The object of its praise is the eye, and the eighty verses (of the hymn) are food, for by means of food he obtains everything.
2	1	2	13	The eighty verses (of the hymn) are alike food with reference to the gods as well as with reference to man. For all these beings breathe and live by means of food indeed. By food (given in alms, &c.) he conquers this world, by food (given in sacrifice) he conquers the other. Therefore the eighty verses (of the hymn) are alike food, with reference to the gods as well as with reference to man.
2	1	2	14	All this that is food, and all this that consumes food, is only the earth, for from the earth arises all whatever there is.
2	1	2	115	And all that goes hence (dies on earth), heaven consumes it all; and all that goes thence (returns from heaven to a new life) the earth consumes it all.
2	1	2	16	That earth is thus both food and consumer.He also (the true worshipper who meditates on himself as being the uktha) is both consumer and consumed (subject and object ). No one possesses that which he does not eat, or the things which do not eat him .
2	1	3	1	Next follows the origin of seed. The seed of Pragâpati are the Devas (gods). The seed of the Devas is rain. The seed of rain are herbs. The seed of herbs is food. The seed of food is seed. The seed of seed are creatures. The seed of creatures is the heart. The seed of the heart is the mind. The seed of the mind is speech (Veda). The seed of speech is action (sacrifice). The action done (in a former state) is this man, the abode of Brahman.
2	1	3	2	He (man) consists of food (irâ), and because he consists of food (irâmaya), he consists of gold (hiranmaya ). He who knows this becomes golden in the other world, and is seen as golden (as the sun) for the benefit of all beings.
2	1	4	1	Brahman (in the shape of prâna, breath) entered into that man by the tips of his feet, and because Brahman entered (prâpadyata) into that man by the tips of his feet, therefore people call them the tips of the feet (prapada), but hoofs and claws in other animals.
2	1	4	2	Then Brahman crept up higher, and therefore they were (called)  the thighs (ûrû).
2	1	4	3	Then he said: 'Grasp wide,' and that was (called) the belly (udara).
2	1	4	4	Then he said: 'Make room for me,' and that was (called) the chest (uras).
2	1	4	5	The Sârkarâkshyas meditate on the belly as Brahman, the Ârunis on the heart . Both (these places) are Brahman indeed .
2	1	4	6	But Brahman crept upwards and came to the head, and because he came to the head, therefore the head is called head .
2	1	4	7	Then these delights alighted in the head, sight, hearing, mind, speech, breath.
2	1	4	8	Delights alight on him who thus knows, why the head is called head.
2	1	4	9	These (five delights or senses) strove together, saying: 'I am the uktha (hymn), I am the uktha .' 'Well,' they said, 'let us all go out fromthis body; then on whose departure this body shall fall, he shall be the uktha among us .'
2	1	4	10	Speech went out, yet the body without speaking remained, eating and drinking.Sight went out, yet the body without seeing remained, eating and drinking.Hearing went out, yet the body without hearing remained, eating and drinking.Mind went out, yet the body, as if blinking, remained, eating and drinking.Breath went out, then when breath was gone out, the body fell.
2	1	4	11	It was decayed, and because people said, it decayed, therefore it was (called) body (sarîra). That is the reason of its name.
2	1	4	12	If a man knows this, then the evil enemy who hates him decays, or the evil enemy who hates him is defeated.
2	1	4	13	They strove again, saying: 'I am the uktha, I am the uktha.' 'Well,' they said, 'let us enter that body again; then on whose entrance this body shall rise again, he shall be the uktha among us.'
2	1	4	14	Speech entered, but the body lay still. Sight entered, but the body lay still. Hearing entered, but the body lay still. Mind entered, but the body lay still. Breath entered, and when breath had entered, the body rose, and it became the uktha.
2	1	4	15	Therefore breath alone is the uktha.
2	1	4	16	Let people know that breath is the uktha indeed.
2	1	4	17	The Devas (the other senses) said to breath: 'Thou art the uktha, thou art all this, we are thine, thou art ours.'
2	1	4	18	This has also been said by a Rishi : 'Thou art ours, we are thine.'
2	1	6	1	Speech is his (the breath's) rope, the names the knots . Thus by his speech as by a rope, and by his names as by knots, all this is bound. For all this are names indeed, and with speech he calls everything.
2	1	6	2	People carry him who knows this, as if they were bound by a rope.
2	1	6	3	Of the body of the breath thus meditated on, the Ushnih verse forms the hairs, the Gâyatrî the skin, the Trishtubh the flesh, the Anushtubh the muscles, the Gagatî the bone, the Paṅkti the marrow, the Brihatî the breath  (prâna). He is covered with the verses (khandas, metres). Because he is thus covered with verses, therefore they call them khandas (coverings, metres).
2	1	6	4	If a man knows the reason why khandas are called khandas, the verses cover him in whatever place he likes against any evil deed.
2	1	6	5	This is said by a Rishi :--
2	1	6	6	'I saw (the breath) as a guardian, never tiring, coming and going on his ways (the arteries). That breath (in the body, being identified with the sun among the Devas), illuminating the principal and intermediate quarters of the sky, is returning constantly in the midst of the worlds.'He says: 'I saw a guardian,' because he, the breath, is a guardian, for he guards everything.
2	1	6	7	He says: 'Never tiring,' because the breath never rests.
2	1	6	8	He says: 'Coming and going on his ways,' because the breath comes and goes on his ways.
2	1	6	9	He says: 'Illuminating the principal and intermediate,' because he illuminates these only, the principal and intermediate quarters of the sky.
2	1	6	10	He says. 'He is returning constantly in the midst of the worlds,' because he returns indeed constantly in the midst of the worlds.
2	1	6	11	And then, there is another verse : 'They are covered like caves by those who make them,'
2	1	6	12	For all this is covered indeed by breath.
2	1	6	13	This ether is supported by breath as Brihatî, and as this ether is supported by breath as Brihatî, so one should know that all things, not excepting ants, are supported by breath as Brihatî.
2	1	7	1	Next follow the powers of that Person .
2	1	7	2	By his speech earth and fire were created.[paragraph continues] Herbs are produced on the earth, and Agni (fire) makes them ripe and sweet. 'Take this, take this,' thus saying do earth and fire serve their parent, speech.
2	1	7	3	As far as the earth reaches, as far as fire reaches, so far does his world extend, and as long as the world of the earth and fire does not decay, so long does his world not decay who thus knows this power of speech.
2	1	7	4	By breath (in the nose) the sky and the air were created. People follow the sky, and hear along the sky, while the air carries along pure scent. Thus do sky and air serve their parent, the breath.As far as the sky reaches, as far as the air reaches, so far does his world extend, and as long as the world of the sky and the air does not decay, so long does his world not decay who thus knows this power of breath.
2	1	7	5	By his eye heaven and the sun were created. Heaven gives him rain and food, while the sun causes his light to shine. Thus do the heaven and the sun serve their parent, the eye.As far as heaven reaches and as far as the sun reaches, so far does his world extend, and as long as the world of heaven and the sun does not decay, so long does his world not decay who thus knows the power of the eye.
2	1	7	6	By his ear the quarters and the moon were created. From all the quarters they come to him, and from all the quarters he hears, while the moon produces for him the bright and the dark halves for the sake of sacrificial work. Thus do the quarters and the moon serve their parent, the ear.As far as the quarters reach and as far as themoon reaches, so far does his world extend, and as long as the world of the quarters and the moon does not decay, so long does his world not decay who thus knows the power of the ear.
2	1	7	7	By his mind the water and Varuna were created. Water yields to him faith (being used for sacred acts), Varuna keeps his offspring within the law. Thus do water and Varuna serve their parent, the mind.As far as water reaches and as far as Varuna reaches, so far does his world extend, and as long as the world of water and Varuna does not decay, so long does his world not decay who thus knows the power of the mind.
2	1	8	1	Was it water really? Was it water? Yes, all this was water indeed. This (water) was the root (cause), that (the world) was the shoot (effect). He (the person) is the father, they (earth, fire, &c.) are the sons. Whatever there is belonging to the son, belongs to the father; whatever there is belonging to the father, belongs to the son. This was intended .
2	1	8	2	Mahidâsa Aitareya, who knew this, said: 'I know myself (reaching) as far as the gods, and I know the gods (reaching) as far as me. For thesegods receive their gifts from hence, and are supported from hence.'
2	1	8	3	This is the mountain , viz. eye, ear, mind, speech, and breath. They call it the mountain of Brahman.
2	1	8	4	He who knows this, throws down the evil enemy who hates him; the evil enemy who hates him is defeated.
2	1	8	5	He (the Prâna, identified with Brahman) is the life, the breath; he is being (while the gîvâtman remains), and not-being (when the gîvâtman departs).
2	1	8	6	The Devas (speech, &c.) worshipped him (prâna) as Bhûti or being, and thus they became great beings. And therefore even now a man who sleeps, breathes like bhûrbhuh.
2	1	8	7	The Asuras worshipped him as Abhûti or not being, and thus they were defeated.
2	1	8	8	He who knows this, becomes great by himself, while the evil enemy who hates him, is defeated.
2	1	8	9	He (the breath) is death (when he departs), and immortality (while he abides).
2	1	8	10	And this has been said by a Rishi :--
2	1	8	11	'Downwards and upwards he (the wind of the breath) goes, held by food;'--for this up-breathing, being held back by the down-breathing, does not move forward (and leave the body altogether).
2	1	8	12	'The immortal dwells with the mortal;'--for through him (the breath) all this dwells together, the bodies being clearly mortal, but this being (the breath), being immortal.
2	1	8	13	'These two (body and breath) go for ever in different directions (the breath moving the senses of the body, the body supporting the senses of the breath: the former going upwards to another world, the body dying and remaining on earth). They increase the one (the body), but they do not increase the other,' i. e. they increase these bodies (by food), but this being (breath) is immortal.
2	1	8	14	He who knows this becomes immortal in that world (having become united with Hiranyagarbha), and is seen as immortal (in the sun) by all beings, yea, by all beings.
2	2	1	1	He (the sun), who shines, honoured this world (the body of the worshipper, by entering into it), in the form of man  (the worshipper who meditates on breath). For he who shines (the sun) is (the same as) the breath. He honoured this (body of the worshipper) during a hundred years, therefore there are a hundred years in the life of a man. Because he honoured him during a hundred years, therefore there are (the poets of the first Mandala of the Rig-veda, called) the Satarkin, (having honour for ahundred years.) Therefore people call him who is really Prâna (breath), the Satarkin poets .
2	2	1	2	He (breath) placed himself in the midst of all whatsoever exists. Because he placed himself in the midst of all whatsoever exists, therefore there are (the poets of the second to the ninth Mandala of the Rig-veda, called) the Mâdhyamas. Therefore people call him who is really Prâna (breath), the Mâdhyama poets.
2	2	1	3	He as up-breathing is the swallower (gritsa), as down-breathing he is delight (mada). Because as up-breathing he is swallower (gritsa) and as down-breathing delight (mada), therefore there is (the poet of the second Mandala of the Rig-veda, called) Gritsamada. Therefore people call him who is really Prâna (breath), Gritsamada.
2	2	1	4	Of him. (breath) all this whatsoever was a friend. Because of him all (visvam) this whatsoever was a friend (mitram), therefore there is (the poet of the third Mandala of the Rig-veda, called) Visvâmitra. Therefore people call him who is really Prâna (breath), Visvâmitra.
2	2	1	5	The Devas (speech, &c.) said to him (the breath): 'He is to be loved by all of us.' Because the Devas said of him, that he was to be loved (vâma) by all of them, therefore there is (the poet of the fourth Mandala of the Rig-veda, called) Vâmadeva. Therefore people call him who is really Prâna (breath), Vâmadeva.
2	2	1	6	He (breath) guarded all this whatsoever from evil. Because he guarded (atrâyata) all this whatsoeverfrom evil, therefore there are (the poets of the fifth Mandala of the Rig-veda, called) Atrayah. Therefore people call him who is really Prâna (breath), Atrayah.
2	2	2	1	He (breath) is likewise a Bibhradvâga (bringer of offspring). Offspring is vâga, and he (breath) supports offspring. Because he supports it, therefore there is (the poet of the sixth Mandala of the Rig-veda, called) Bharadvâga. Therefore people call him who is really Prâna (breath), Bharadvâga.
2	2	2	2	The Devas (speech, &c.) said to him: 'He it is who chiefly causes us to dwell on earth.' Because the Devas said of him, that he chiefly caused them to dwell on earth, therefore there is (the poet of the seventh Mandala of the Rig-veda, called) Vasishtha. Therefore people call him who is really Prâna (breath), Vasishtha .
2	2	2	3	He (breath) went forth towards  all this whatsoever. Because he went forth toward all this whatsoever, therefore there are (the poets of the eighth Mandala of the Rig-veda, called) the Pragâthas. Therefore people call him who is really Prâna (breath), the Pragâthas.
2	2	2	4	He (breath) purified all this whatsoever. Because he purified all this whatsoever, therefore thereare (the hymns and also the poets  of the ninth Mandala of the Rig-veda, called) the Pavamânîs. Therefore people called him who is really Prâna (breath), the Pavamânîs.
2	2	2	5	He (breath) said: 'Let me be everything whatsoever, small (kshudra) and great (mahat), and this became the Kshudrasûktas and Mahâsûktas.' Therefore there were (the hymns and also the poets of the tenth Mandala of the Rig-veda, called) the Kshudrasûktas (and Mahâsûktas). Therefore people call him who is really Prâna (breath), the Kshudrasûktas (and Mahâsûktas).
2	2	2	6	He (breath) said once: 'You have said what is well said (su-ukta) indeed. This became a Sûkta (hymn).' Therefore there was the Sûkta. Therefore people call him who is really Prâna (breath), Sûkta .
2	2	2	7	He (breath) is a Rik (verse), for he did honour  to all beings (by entering into them). Because he did honour to all beings, therefore there was the Rik verse. Therefore people call him who is really Prâna (breath), Rik.
2	2	2	8	He (breath) is an Ardharka (half-verse), for he did honour to all places (ardha) . Because he did honour to all places, therefore there was the Ardharka. Therefore people call him who is really Prâna (breath), Ardharka.
2	2	2	9	He (breath) is a Pada (word) , for he got into all these beings. Because he got (pâdi) into all these beings, therefore there was the Pada (word). Therefore people call him who is really Prâna (breath), Pada.
2	2	2	10	He (breath) is an Akshara (syllable), for he pours out (ksharati) gifts to all these beings, and without him no one can pour out (atiksharati) gifts. Therefore there was the Akshara (syllable). Therefore people call him who is really Prâna (breath), Akshara .
2	2	2	11	Thus all these Rik verses, all Vedas, all sounds  are one word, viz. Prâna (breath). Let him know that Prâna is all Rik verses.
2	2	3	1	While Visvâmitra was going to repeat the hymns of this day (the mahâvrata), Indra sat down near him . Visvâmitra (guessing that Indra wanted food) said to him, 'This (the verses of the hymn) is food,' and repeated the thousand Brihatî verses [paragraph continues] By means of this he went to the delightful home of Indra (Svarga).
2	2	3	2	Indra said to him: 'Rishi, thou hast come to my delightful home. Rishi, repeat a second hymn .' Visvâmitra (guessing that Indra wanted food) said to him, 'This (the verses of the hymn) is food,' and repeated the thousand Brihatî verses. By means of this he went to the delightful home of Indra (Svarga).
2	2	3	3	Indra said to him: 'Rishi, thou hast come to my delightful home. Rishi, repeat a third hymn.' Visvâmitra (guessing that Indra wanted food) said to him, 'This (the verses of the hymn) is food,' and repeated the thousand Brihatî verses. By means of this he went to the delightful home of Indra (Svarga).
2	2	3	4	Indra said to him: 'Rishi, thou hast come to my delightful home. I grant thee a boon.' Visvâmitra said: 'May I know thee.' Indra said: 'I am Prâna (breath), O Rishi, thou art Prâna, all things are Prâna. For it is Prâna who shines as the sun, and I here pervade all regions under that form. This food of mine (the hymn) is my friend and my support (dakshina). This is the food prepared by Visvâmitra. I am verily he who shines (the sun).'
2	2	4	1	This then becomes perfect as a thousand of Brihatî verses. Its consonants  form its body, its voice  (vowels) the Soul , its sibilants  the air of the breath.
2	2	4	2	He who knew this became Vasishtha, he took this name from thence .
2	2	4	3	Indra verily declared this to Visvâmitra, and Indra verily declared this to Bharadvâga. Therefore Indra is invoked by him as a friend .
2	2	4	4	This becomes perfect as a thousand of Brihatî verses , and of that hymn perfect with a thousand Brihad verses, there are
2	2	4	36	,
2	2	4	000	syllables . So many are also the thousands of days of a hundred years . With the consonants they fill the nights, with the vowels the days.
2	2	4	5	This becomes perfect as a thousand of Brihatî verses. He who knows this, after this thousand of Brihatîs thus accomplished, becomes full of knowledge, full of the gods, full of Brahman, full of the immortal, and then goes also to the gods.
2	2	4	6	What I am (the worshipper), that is he (sun); what he is, that am I.
2	2	4	7	This has been said by a Rishi : 'The sun is the self of all that moves and rests.'
2	2	4	8	Let him look to that, let him look to that!
2	3	1	1	He who knows himself as the fivefold hymn (uktha), the emblem of Prâna (breath), from whence all this springs , he is clever. These five are the earth, air, ether, water, and fire (gyotis). This is the self, the fivefold uktha. For from him all this springs, and into him it enters again (at the dissolution of the world). He who knows this, becomes the refuge of his friends.
2	3	1	2	And to him who knows the food (object) and the feeder (subject) in that uktha, a strong son is born, and food is never wanting. Water and earth are food, for all food consists of these two. Fire and air are the feeder, for by means of them  man eats all food. Ether is the bowl, for all this is poured into the ether. He who knows this, becomes the bowl or support of his friends.
2	3	1	3	To him who knows the food and the feeder in that uktha, a strong son is born, and food is never wanting. Herbs and trees are food, animals the feeder, for animals eat herbs and trees.
2	3	1	4	Of them again those who have teeth aboveand below, shaped after the likeness of man, are feeders, the other animals are food. Therefore these overcome the other animals, for the eater is over the food.
2	3	1	5	He who knows this is over his friends.
2	3	2	1	He who knows the gradual development of the self in him (the man conceived as the uktha), obtains himself more development.
2	3	2	2	There are herbs and trees and all that is animated, and he knows the self gradually developing in them. For in herbs and trees sap only is seen , but thought (kitta) in animated beings.Among animated beings again the self develops gradually, for in some sap (blood) is seen (as well as thought), but in others thought is not seen.
2	3	2	4	And in man again the self develops gradually, for he is most endowed with knowledge. He says what he has known, he sees what he has known . He knows what is to happen to-morrow, he knows heaven and hell. By means of the mortal he desires the immortal--thus is he endowed.
2	3	2	5	With regard to the other animals hunger and thirst only are a kind of understanding. But they do not say what they have known, nor do they seewhat they have known. They do not know what is to happen to-morrow, nor heaven and hell. They go so far and no further, for they are born according to their knowledge (in a former life).
2	3	3	1	That man (conceived as uktha) is the sea, rising beyond the whole world . Whatever he reaches, he wishes to go beyond . If he reaches the sky, he wishes to go beyond.
2	3	3	2	If he should reach that (heavenly) world, he would wish to go beyond.
2	3	3	3	That man is fivefold. The heat in him is fire; the apertures (of the senses) are ether; blood, mucus, and seed are water; the body is earth; breath is air.
2	3	3	4	That air is fivefold, viz. up-breathing, down-breathing, back-breathing, out-breathing, on-breathing. The other powers (devatâs), viz. sight, hearing, mind, and speech, are comprised under up-breathing and down-breathing. For when breath departs, they also depart with it.
2	3	3	5	That man (conceived as uktha) is the sacrifice, which is a succession now of speech and now of thought. That sacrifice is fivefold, viz. the Agnihotra, the new and full moon sacrifices, the four-monthly sacrifices, the animal sacrifice, the Soma sacrifice. The Soma sacrifice is the most perfect of sacrifices, for in it these five kinds of ceremonies are seen: the first which precedes the libations (the Dîkshâ, &c.), then three libations, and what follows (the Avabhritha, &c.) is the fifth.
2	3	4	1	He who knows one sacrifice above another, one day above another, one deity above the others, he is clever. Now this great uktha (the nishkevalya-sastra) is the sacrifice above another, the day above another, the deity above others .
2	3	4	2	This uktha is fivefold. With regard to its being performed as a Stoma (chorus), it is Trivrit, Pañkadasa, Saptadasa, Ekavimsa, and Pañkavimsa. With regard to its being performed as a Sâman (song), it is Gâyatra, Rathantara, Brihat, Bhadra, and Râgana. With regard to metre, it is Gâyatrî, Ushnih, Brihatî, Trishtubh, and Dvipadâ. And the explanation (given before in the Âranyaka) is that it is the head, the right wing, the left wing, the tail, and the body of the bird .
 
  in each hymn. This, is the first round. He then sings the three middle verses in each hymn. This is the second round. He lastly sings the last three verses in each hymn. This is the third round. This song is called Udyatî.The Pañkadasa stoma is formed out of one Sûkta only, consisting of three verses. In the first round he sings the first verse  three times, the second and third once. In the second round he sings the middle verse three times, in the third round he sings the last verse three times. This song is called Vishtuti.The Saptadasa stoma is formed in the same manner, only that in the first round he sings the first verse three times, in the second the middle verse three times, in the third round the middle and last verses three times. This song is called Dasasapta.The Ekavimsa stoma is formed in the same manner, only that in the first round he sings the last verse once, in the second the first verse once, in the third the middle verse once, while the other verses are each repeated three times. This song is called Saptasaptinî.The Pañkavimsa stoma is formed in the same manner, only that in the first round he sings the first verse three times, the second four times, the last once; in the second round the first once, the second three times, the third four times; in the third round the first five times, the second once, the last three times; or he sings in the third round the first verse four times, the second twice, the last three times.Sâyana in his commentary on the Ait. Âr. takes the Trivrit stoma to be formed out of three hymns, each consisting of three verses, while he says that the other stomas are formed out of one hymn only. B. and R., sv. trivrit, state that this stoma consists of verses
2	3	4	1	,
2	3	4	4	,
2	3	4	7	;
2	3	4	2	,
2	3	4	5	,
2	3	4	8	; and
2	3	4	3	,
2	3	4	6	,
2	3	4	9	of the Rig-veda hymn IX,
2	3	4	11	, but, according to Sâyana, the stoma consists  of the first verses of the three Sûktas, upâsmai gâyata, davidyutatyâ, and pavamânasya at the beginning of the Sâma-veda-Uttarârkika,  of the second,  Of the third verses of the same three hymns. Mahîdhâra  takes the same view, though the MSS. seem to have left out the description of the second paryâya, while Sâyana in his commentary to the Tândya-brâhmana seems to support the opinion of B. and R. There is an omission, however, in the printed text of the commentary, which makes it difficult to see the exact meaning of Sâyana.The Pañkadasa stoma is well described by Sâyana, Tândya Br. II,
2	3	4	4	Taking the Sûkta agna â yâhi , he shows the stoma to consist of  verse
2	3	4	1	×
2	3	4	3	,
2	3	4	2	,
2	3	4	3	verse
2	3	4	1	,
2	3	4	2	×

2	3	4	3	;  verse
2	3	4	1	,
2	3	4	2	,
2	3	4	3	×
2	3	4	3	The five Sâmans are explained by the commentator. The  Gâyatra is formed out of the Rik  tat savitur varenyam. The Rathantara is formed out of the Rik  abhi tvâ sûra nonuma. The Brihat is formed out of the Rik  tvâm id dhi havâmahe. The Bhadra is formed out of the Rik  imâ nu kam. The Râgana is formed out of the Rik  indram naro nemadhitâ.The metres require no explanation.In identifying certain portions of the Nishkevalya hymn with a bird, the head of the bird corresponds to the hymns indram id gâthinah, &c.; the right wing to the hymns abhi tvâ sûra, &c.; the left wing to the hymns tvâm id dhi, &c.; the tail to the hymns imâ nu kam, &c.; the body to the hymns tad id âsa, &c. All this was explained in the first Âranyaka.
2	3	4	3	He performs the Prastâva in five ways, he performs the Udgîtha in five ways, he performs the[paragraph continues] Pratihâra in five ways, he performs the Upadrava in five ways, he performs the Nidhana in five ways . All this together forms one thousand Stobhas, or musical syllables .
2	3	4	4	Thus also are the Rik verses, contained in the Nishkevalya, recited (by the Hotri) in five orders. What precedes the eighty trikas, that is one order, then follow the three sets of eighty trikas each, and what comes after is the fifth order .
2	3	4	5	This (the hymns of this Sastra) as a whole (if properly counted with the Stobha syllables) comes to one thousand (of Brihatî verses). That (thousand) is the whole, and ten, ten is called the whole. For number is such (measured by ten). Ten tens are a hundred, ten hundreds are a thousand, and that is the whole. These are the three metres (the tens, pervading everything). And this food also (the three sets of hymns being represented as food) is threefold, eating, drinking, and chewing. He obtains that food by those (three numbers, ten, hundred, and thousand, or by the three sets of eighty trikas).
2	3	5	1	This (nishkevalya-sastra) becomes perfect as a thousand of Brihatî verses.
2	3	5	2	Some teachers (belonging to a different Sâkhâ) recognise a thousand of different metres (not of Brihatîs only). They say: 'Is another thousand (a thousand of other verses) good? Let us say it is good.'
2	3	5	3	Some say, a thousand of Trishtubh verses, others a thousand of Gagatî verses, others a thousand of Anushtubh verses.
2	3	5	4	This has been said by a Rishi :--
2	3	5	5	'Poets through their understanding discovered Indra dancing an Anushtubh.' This is meant to say: They discovered (and meditated) in speech (called Anushtubh)--at that time (when they worshippedthe uktha)--the Prâna (breath) connected with Indra.
2	3	5	6	He (who takes the recited verses as Anushtubhs) is able to become celebrated and of good report.
2	3	5	7	No! he says; rather is such a man liable to die before his time. For that self (consisting of Anushtubhs) is incomplete. For if a man confines himself to speech, not to breath, then driven by his mind, he does not succeed with speech .
2	3	5	8	Let him work towards the Brihatî, for the Brihatî (breath) is the complete self.
2	3	5	9	That self (gîvâtman) is surrounded on all sides by members. And as that self is on all sides surrounded by members, the Brihatî also is on all sides surrounded by metres .
2	3	5	10	For the self (in the heart) is the middle of these members, and the Brihatî is the middle of the metres.
2	3	5	11	'He is able to become celebrated and of goodreport, but (the other) able to die before his time,' thus he said. For the Brihatî is the complete self, therefore let him work towards the Brihatî (let him reckon the sastra recitation as a thousand Brihatîs).
2	3	6	1	This (nishkevalya-sastra) becomes perfect as a thousand of Brihatî verses. In this thousand of Brihatîs there are one thousand one hundred and twenty-five Anushtubhs. For the smaller is contained in the larger.
2	3	6	2	This has been said by a Rishi :--
2	3	6	3	'A speech of eight feet;'--because there are eight feet of four syllables each in the Anushtubh.
2	3	6	4	'Of nine corners;'--because the Brihatî becomes nine-cornered (having nine feet of four syllables each).
2	3	6	5	'Touching the truth;'--because speech (Anushtubh) is truth, touched by the verse (Brihatî) .
2	3	6	6	'He (the Hotri) makes the body out of Indra;--'for out of this thousand of Brihatî verses turned into Anushtubhs, and therefore out of Prâna as connected with Indra , and out of the Brihatî (which is Prâna), he makes speech, that is Anushtubh, as a body .
2	3	6	7	This Mahaduktha is the highest developmentof speech, and it is fivefold, viz. measured, not measured, music, true, and untrue.
2	3	6	8	A Rik verse, a gâthâ , a kumbyâ  are measured (metrical). A Yagus line, an invocation, and general remarks , these are not measured (they are in prose). A Sâman, or any portion (parvan) of it, is music. Om is true, Na is untrue.
2	3	6	9	What is true (Om) is the flower and fruit of speech. He is able to become celebrated and of good report, for he speaks the true (Om), the flower and fruit of speech.
2	3	6	10	Now the untrue is the root  of speech, and as a tree whose root is exposed dries up and perishes, thus a man who says what is untrue exposes his root, dries up and perishes. Therefore one should not say what is untrue, but guard oneself from it.
2	3	6	11	That syllable Om (yes) goes forward (to the first cause of the world) and is empty. Therefore if a man says Om (yes) to everything, then that (which he gives away) is wanting to him here . If he says Om (yes) to everything, then he would empty himself, and would not be capable of any enjoyments.
2	3	6	12	That syllable Na (no) is full for oneself . If a man says No to everything, then his reputationwould become evil, and that would ruin him even here.
2	3	6	13	Therefore let a man give at the proper time only, not at the wrong time. Thus he unites the true and the untrue, and from the union of those two he grows, and becomes greater and greater.
2	3	6	14	He who knows this speech of which this (the mahaduktha) is a development, he is clever. A is the whole of speech, and manifested through different kinds of contact (mutes) and of wind (sibilants), it becomes manifold and different.
2	3	6	15	Speech if uttered in a whisper is breath, if spoken aloud, it is body. Therefore (if whispered) it is almost hidden, for what is incorporeal is almost hidden, and breath is incorporeal. But if spoken aloud, it is body, and therefore it is perceptible, for body is perceptible.
2	3	7	1	This (nishkevalya-sastra) becomes perfect as a thousand of Brihatîs. It is glory (the glorious Brahman, not the absolute Brahman), it is Indra. Indra is the lord of all beings. He who thus knows Indra as the lord of all beings, departs from this world by loosening the bonds of life --so said Mahidâsa Aitareya. Having departed he becomes Indra (or Hiranyagarbha) and shines in those worlds .
2	3	7	2	And with regard to this they say: 'If a man obtains the other world in this form (by meditating on the prâna, breath, which is the uktha, the hymn of the mahâvrata), then in what form does he obtain this world ?'
2	3	7	3	Here the blood of the woman is a form of Agni (fire); therefore no one should despise it. And the seed of the man is a form of Âditya (sun); therefore no one should despise it. This self (the woman) gives her self (skin, blood, and flesh) to that self (fat, bone, and marrow), and that self (man) gives his self (fat, bone, and marrow) to this self (skin, blood, and flesh). Thus  these two grow together. In this form (belonging to the woman and to fire) he goes to that world (belonging to the man and the sun), and in that form (belonging to man and the sun) he goes to this world (belonging to the woman and to fire ).
2	3	8	1	Here (with regard to obtaining Hiranyagarbha) there are these Slokas:
2	3	8	2	The fivefold body into which the indestructible (prâna, breath) enters, that body which the harnessed horses (the senses) draw about, that body where the true of the true (the highest Brahman) follows after, in that body (of the worshipper) all gods  become one.
2	3	8	3	That body into which goes the indestructible (the breath) which we have joined (in meditation), proceeding from the indestructible (the highest Brahman), that body which the harnessed horses (the senses) draw about, that body where the true of the true follows after, in that body all gods become one.
2	3	8	4	After separating themselves from the Yes and No of language, and of all that is hard and cruel, poets have discovered (what they sought for); dependent on names they rejoiced in what had been revealed .
2	3	8	5	That in which the poets rejoiced (the revealed nature of prâna, breath), in it the gods exist all joined together. Having driven away evil by means of that Brahman (which is hidden in prâna), the enlightened man goes to the Svarga world (becomes one with Hiranyagarbha , the universal spirit).
2	3	8	6	No one wishing to describe him (prâna, breath) by speech, describes him by calling him 'woman,' 'neither woman nor man,' or 'man' (all such names applying only to the material body, and not to prâna or breath).
2	3	8	7	Brahman (as hidden beneath prâna) is called the A; and the I (ego) is gone there (the worshipper should know that he is uktha and prâna).
2	3	8	8	This becomes perfect as a thousand of Brihatî verses, and of that hymn, perfect with a thousand Brihad verses, there are
2	3	8	36	,
2	3	8	000	syllables. So many are also the thousands of days of human life . By means of the syllable of life (the a) alone (which is contained in that thousand of hymns) does a man obtain the day of life (the mahâvrata day, which completes the number of the days in the Gavâmayana, sacrifice), and by means of the day of life (he obtains) the syllable of life.
2	3	8	9	Now there is a chariot of the god (prâna) destroying all desires (for the worlds of Indra, the moon, the earth, all of which lie below the place of Hiranyagarbha). Its front part (the point of the two shafts of the carriage where the yoke is fastened) is speech, its wheels the cars, the horses the eyes, the driver the mind. Prâna (breath) mounts that chariot (and on it, i. e. by means of meditating on Prâna, he reaches Hiranyagarbha).
2	3	8	10	This has been said by a Rishi :--
2	3	8	11	'Come hither on that which is quicker than mind,' and  'Come hither on that which is quicker than the twinkling of an eye,' yea, the twinkling of an eye .
2	4	2	1	Those deities (devatâ), Agni and the rest, after they had been sent forth, fell into this great ocean .Then he (the Self) besieged him, (the person) with hunger and thirst.
2	4	2	2	The deities then (tormented by hunger and thirst) spoke to him (the Self): 'Allow us a place in which we may rest and eat food .' He led a cow towards them (the deities). They said: 'This is not enough.' He led a horse towards them. They said: 'This is not enough.' He led man  towards them. Then they said: 'Well done , indeed.' Therefore man is well done.
2	4	2	3	He said to them: 'Enter, each according to his place.'
2	4	2	4	Then Agni (fire), having become speech, entered the mouth. Vâyu (air), having become scent, entered the nostrils. Âditya (sun), having become sight, entered the eyes. The Dis (regions), having become hearing, entered the ears. The shrubs and trees, having become hairs, entered the skin. Kandramas (the moon), having become mind, enteredthe heart. Death, having become down-breathing, entered the navel. The waters, having become seed, entered the generative organ.
2	4	2	5	Then Hunger and Thirst spoke to him (the Self): 'Allow us two (a place).' He said to them: 'I assign you to those very deities there, I make you co-partners with them.' Therefore to whatever deity an oblation is offered, hunger and thirst are co-partners in it.
2	4	3	1	He thought: 'There are these worlds and the guardians of the worlds. Let me send forth food for them.' He brooded over the water . From the water thus brooded on, matter  (mûrti) was born. And that matter which was born, that verily was food .
2	4	3	2	When this food (the object matter) had thus been sent forth, it wished to flee , crying and turning away. He (the subject) tried to grasp it by speech. He could not grasp it by speech. If he had grasped it by speech, man would be satisfied by naming food. He tried to grasp it by scent (breath). He could not grasp it by scent. If he had grasped it by scent, man would be satisfied by smelling food. He tried to grasp it by the eye. He could notgrasp it by the eye. If he had grasped it by the eye, man would be satisfied by seeing food. He tried to grasp it by the ear. He could not grasp it by the ear. If he had grasped it by the ear, man would be satisfied by hearing food. He tried to grasp it by the skin. He could not grasp it by the skin. If he had grasped it by the skin, man would be satisfied by touching food. He tried to grasp it by the mind. He could not grasp it by the mind. If he had grasped it by the mind, man would be satisfied by thinking food. He tried to grasp it by the generative organ. He could not grasp it by the organ. If he had grasped it by the organ, man would be satisfied by sending forth food. He tried to grasp it by the down-breathing (the breath which helps to swallow food through the mouth and to carry it off through the rectum, the pâyvindriya). He got it.
2	4	3	3	Thus it is Vâyu (the getter ) who lays hold of food, and the Vâyu is verily Annâyu (he who gives life or who lives by food).
2	4	3	4	He thought: 'How can all this be without me?'
2	4	3	5	And then he thought: 'By what way shall I get there ?'
2	4	3	6	And then he thought: 'If speech names, if scent smells, if the eye sees, if the ear hears, if the skin feels, if the mind thinks, if the off-breathing digests, if the organ sends forth, then what am I?'
2	4	3	7	Then opening the suture of the skull, he got in by that door.
2	4	3	8	That door is called the Vidriti (tearing asunder), the Nândana (the place of bliss).
2	4	3	9	There are three dwelling-places for him, three dreams; this dwelling-place (the eye), this dwelling-place (the throat), this dwelling-place (the heart) .
2	4	3	10	When born (when the Highest Self had entered the body) he looked through all things, in order to see whether anything wished to proclaim here another (Self). He saw this person only (himself) as the widely spread Brahman. 'I saw it,' thus he said ; Therefore he was Idam-dra (seeing this).
2	4	3	11	Being Idamdra by name, they call him Indra mysteriously. For the Devas love mystery, yea, they love mystery.
2	5	1	1	Let the women who are with child move away !
2	5	1	2	Verily, from the beginning he (the self) is in man as a germ, which is called seed.
2	5	1	3	This (seed), which is strength gathered from all the limbs of the body, he (the man) bears as self in his self (body). When he commits the seed to the woman, then he (the father) causes it to be born. That is his first birth.
2	5	1	4	That seed becomes the self of the woman, asif one of her own limbs. Therefore it does not injure her.
2	5	1	5	She nourishes his (her husband's) self (the son) within her.  She who nourishes, is to be nourished.
2	5	1	6	The woman bears the germ. He (the father) elevates the child even before the birth, and immediately after .
2	5	1	7	When he thus elevates the child both before and after his birth, he really elevates his own self,
2	5	1	8	For the continuation of these worlds (men). For thus are these worlds continued.
2	5	1	9	This is his second birth.
2	5	1	10	He (the son), being his self, is then placed in his stead for (the performance of) all good works.
2	5	1	11	But his other self (the father), having done all he has to do, and having reached the full measure of his life, departs.
2	5	1	12	And departing from hence he is born again. That is his third birth.
2	5	1	13	And this has been declared by a Rishi :
2	5	1	14	'While dwelling in the womb, I discovered all the births of these Devas. A hundred iron strongholds kept me, but I escaped quickly down like a falcon.'
2	5	1	15	Vâmadeva, lying in the womb, has thus declared this. And having this knowledge he stepped forth, after this dissolution of the body, and having obtained all his desires in that heavenly world, became immortal, yea, he became immortal.
2	6	1	1	Let the women go back to their place.
2	6	1	2	Who is he whom  we meditate on as the Self? Which  is the Self?
2	6	1	3	That by which we see (form), that by which we hear (sound), that by which we perceive smells, that by which we utter speech, that by which we distinguish sweet and not sweet,  and what comes from the heart and the mind, namely, perception, command, understanding, knowledge, wisdom, seeing, holding, thinking, considering, readiness (or suffering), remembering, conceiving, willing, breathing, loving, desiring?
2	6	1	4	No, all these are various names only of knowledge (the true Self).
2	6	1	5	And that Self, consisting of (knowledge), is Brahman (m.) , it is Indra, it is Pragâpati . All these Devas, these five great elements, earth, air, ether, water, fire, these and those which are, as it were, small and mixed , and seeds of this kind and that kind, born from eggs, born from the womb., born from heat, born from germs , horses, cows, men, elephants, and whatsoever breathes, whether walking or flying, and what is immoveable--all that is led (produced) by knowledge (the Self).
2	6	1	6	It rests on knowledge (the Self). The worldis led (produced) by knowledge (the Self). Knowledge is its cause .
2	6	1	7	Knowledge is Brahman.
2	6	1	8	He (Vâmadeva), having by this conscious self stepped forth from this world, and having obtained all desires in that heavenly world, became immortal, yea, he became immortal. Thus it is, Om.
2	7	1	1	My speech rests in the mind, my mind rests in speech . Appear to me (thou, the Highest Self)! You (speech and mind) are the two pins  (that hold the wheels) of the Veda. May what I have learnt not forsake me . I join day and night with what I have learnt . I shall speak of the real, I shall speak the true. May this protect me, may this protect the teacher! May it protect me, may it protect the teacher, yea, the teacher!
3	1	1	1	Next follows the Upanishad of the Samhitâ .
3	1	1	2	The former half is the earth, the latter half the heaven, their union the air , thus says Mândukeya; their union is the ether, thus did Mâkshavya teach it.
3	1	1	3	That air is not considered  independent , therefore I do not agree with his (Mandûka's) son.
3	1	1	4	Verily, the two are the same, therefore air isconsidered independent, thus says Âgastya. For it is the same, whether they say air or ether .
3	1	1	5	So far with reference to deities (mythologically); now with reference to the body (physiologically):
3	1	1	6	The former half is speech, the latter half is mind, their union breath (prâna), thus says Sûravîra  Mândukeya.
3	1	1	7	But his eldest son said: The former half is mind, the latter half speech. For we first conceive with the mind indeed , and then we utter with speech. Therefore the former half is indeed mind, the latter half speech, but their union is really breath.
3	1	1	8	Verily, it is the same with both, the father (Mândukeya) and the son .
3	1	1	9	This (meditation as here described), joined  with mind, speech, and breath, is (like) a chariot drawn by two horses and one horse between them (prashtivâhana).
3	1	1	10	And he who thus knows this union, becomes united with offspring, cattle, fame, glory of countenance, and the world of Svarga. He lives his full age.
3	1	1	11	Now all this comes from the Mândukeyas.
3	1	2	1	Next comes the meditation as taught by Sâkalya.
3	1	2	2	The first half is the earth, the second half heaven, their uniting the rain, the uniter Parganya .
3	1	2	3	And so it is when he (Parganya) rains thus strongly, without ceasing, day and night ,
3	1	2	4	Then they say also (in ordinary language), 'Heaven and earth have come together.'
3	1	2	5	So much with regard to the deities; now with regard to the body:--
3	1	2	6	Every man is indeed like an egg . There are two halves  (of him), thus they say: 'This half is the earth, that half heaven.' And there between them is the ether (the space of the mouth), like the ether between heaven and earth. In this ether there (in the mouth) the breath is fixed, as in that other ether the air is fixed. And as there are those three luminaries (in heaven), there are these three luminaries in man.
3	1	2	7	As there is that sun in heaven, there is this eye in the head. As there is that lightning in the sky, there is this heart in the body; as there is that fire on earth, there is this seed in the member.
3	1	2	8	Having thus represented the self (body) as the whole world, Sâkalya said: This half is the earth, that half heaven.
3	1	2	9	He who thus knows this union, becomes united with offspring, cattle, fame, glory of countenance,and the world of Svarga. He lives his full age.
3	1	4	1	Next follow the imprecations .
3	1	4	2	Let him know that breath  is the beam (on which the whole house of the body rests).
3	1	4	3	If any one (a Brâhmana or another man) should chide him, who by meditation has become that breath as beam , then, if he thinks himself strong, he says: 'I grasped the breath, the beam, well; thou dost not prevail against me who have grasped the breath as the beam.' Let him say to him: 'Breath, the beam, will forsake thee.'
3	1	4	4	But if he thinks himself not strong, let him say to him: 'Thou couldst not grasp him who wishes to grasp the breath as the beam. Breath, the beam, will forsake thee.'
3	1	4	5	And whatever the reciter shall say to one who speaks to him or does not speak to him, depend upon it, it will come to pass. But to a Brâhmana let him not say anything except what is auspicious. Only he may curse a Brâhmana in excessive wealth. Nay, not even in excessive wealth should he curse a Brâhmana, but he should say, 'I bow before Brâhmanas,'--thus says Sûravîra Mândûkeya.
3	1	5	1	Now those who repeat the Nirbhuga say:
3	1	5	2	'The former half  is the first syllable, the latter half the second syllable, and the space between the first and second halves is the Samhitâ (union).'
3	1	5	3	He who thus knows this Samhitâ (union), becomes united with offspring, cattle, fame, glory of countenance, and the world of Svarga. He lives his full age.
3	1	5	4	Now Hrasva Mândûkeya says: 'We reciters of Nirbhuga say, "Yes, the former half is the first syllable, and the latter half the second syllable, but the Samhitâ is the space between the first and second halves in so far as by it one turns out the union (sandhi), and knows what is the accent and what is not , and distinguishes what is the mora and what is not."'
3	1	5	5	He who thus knows this Samhitâ (union), becomes united with offspring, cattle, fame, glory of countenance, and the world of Svarga. He lives his full age.
3	1	5	6	Now his middle son, the child of his mother Prâtibodhî , says: 'One pronounces these two syllables letter by letter, without entirely separatingthem, and without entirely uniting them . Then that mora between the first and second halves, which indicates the union, that is the Sâman (evenness, sliding). I therefore hold Sâman only to be the Samhitâ (union).
3	1	5	7	This has also been declared by a Rishi :--
3	1	5	8	'O Brihaspati, they know nothing higher than Sâman.'
3	1	5	9	He who thus knows this Samhitâ (union), becomes united with offspring, cattle, fame, glory of countenance, and the world of Svarga. He lives his full age.
3	1	6	1	Târukshya  said: 'The Samhitâ (union) is formed by means of the Brihat and Rathantara  Sâmans.'
3	1	6	2	Verily, the Rathantara Sâman is speech, the Brihat Sâman is breath. By both, by speech and breath, the Samhitâ is formed .
3	1	6	3	For this Upanishad (for acquiring from his teacher the knowledge of this Samhitâ of speech and breath) Târukshya guards (his teacher's) cows a whole year.
3	1	6	4	For it alone Târukshya guards the cows a whole year.
3	1	6	5	This has also been declared by a Rishi :--
3	1	6	6	'Vasishtha carried hither the Rathantara; 'Bharadvâga brought hither the Brihat of Agni.'
3	1	6	7	He who thus knows this Samhitâ (union), becomes united with offspring, cattle, fame, glory of countenance, and the world of Svarga. He lives his full age.
3	1	6	8	Kauntharavya said: 'Speech is united with breath, breath with the blowing air, the blowing air with the Visvedevas, the Visvedevas with the heavenly world, the heavenly world with Brahman. That Samhitâ is called the gradual Samhitâ.'
3	1	6	9	He who knows this gradual Samhitâ (union), becomes united with offspring, cattle, fame, glory of countenance, and the world of Svarga, in exactly the same manner as this Samhitâ, i.e. gradually.
3	1	6	10	If that worshipper, whether for his own sake or for that of another, recites (the Samhitâ), let him know when he is going to recite, that this Samhitâ went up to heaven, and that it will be even so with those who by knowing it become Devas. May it always be so!
3	1	6	11	He who thus knows this Samhitâ (union), becomes united with offspring, cattle, fame, glory of countenance, and the world of Svarga. He lives his full age.
3	1	6	12	Pañkâlakanda said: 'The Samhitâ (union, composition) is speech.'
3	1	6	13	Verily, by speech the Vedas, by speech the metres are composed. Friends unite through speech, all beings unite through speech; therefore speech is everything here .
3	1	6	14	With regard to this (view of speech being more than breath), it should be borne in mind that when we thus repeat (the Veda) or speak, breath is (absorbed) in speech; speech swallows breath. And when we are silent or sleep, speech is (absorbed) in breath; breath swallows speech. The two swallow each other. Verily, speech is the mother, breath the son.
3	1	6	15	This has been declared also by a Rishi :--
3	1	6	16	'There is one bird; (as wind) he has entered the sky; (as breath or living soul) he saw this whole world. With my ripe mind I saw him close to me (in the heart); the mother (licks or) absorbs him (breath), and he absorbs the mother (speech).'
3	1	6	17	He who thus knows this Samhitâ (union), becomes united with offspring, cattle, fame, glory of countenance, and the world of Svarga. He lives his full age.
3	1	6	18	Next follows the Pragâpati-Samhitâ.
3	1	6	19	The former half is the wife, the latter half the man; the result of their union the son; the act of their union the begetting; that Samhitâ is Aditi (indestructible).
3	1	6	20	For Aditi (indestructible) is all this whatever there is, father, mother, son, and begetting.
3	1	6	21	This has also been declared by a Rishi --
3	1	6	22	'Aditi is mother, is father, is son.'
3	1	6	23	He who thus knows this Samhitâ (union), becomes united with offspring, cattle, fame, glory of countenance, and the world of Svarga. He lives his full age.
3	2	1	1	Sthavira Sâkalya said that breath is the beam , and as the other beams rest on the house-beam, thus the eye, the ear, the mind, the speech, the senses, the body, the whole self rests on this  breath.
3	2	1	2	Of that self the breathing is like the sibilants, the bones like the mutes, the marrow like the vowels, and the fourth part, flesh, blood, and the rest, like the semivowels ,--so said Hrasva Mândûkeya.
3	2	1	3	To us it was said to be a triad only .
3	2	1	4	Of that triad, viz. bones, marrow, and joints, there are
3	2	1	360	(parts) on this side (the right), and
3	2	1	360	on that side (the left). They make
3	2	1	720	together, and
3	2	1	720	are the days and nights of the year. Thus that self which consists of sight, hearing, metre, mind, and speech is like unto the days.
3	2	1	5	He who thus knows this self, which consists of sight, hearing, metre, mind, and speech, as like unto the days, obtains union, likeness, or nearness with the days, has sons and cattle, and lives his full age.
3	2	2	1	Next comes Kauntharavya:
3	2	2	2	There are
3	2	2	360	syllables (vowels),
3	2	2	360	sibilants (consonants),
3	2	2	360	, groups.
3	2	2	3	What we called syllables are the days, what we called sibilants are the nights, what we called groups are the junctions of days and nights. So far with regard to the gods (the days).
3	2	2	4	Now with regard to the body. The syllables which we explained mythologically, are physiologically the bones; the sibilants which we explained mythologically, are physiologically the marrow.
3	2	2	5	Marrow is the real breath (life), for marrow is seed, and without breath (life) seed is not sown. Or when it is sown without breath (life), it will decay, it will not grow.
3	2	2	6	The groups which we explained mythologically, are physiologically the joints.
3	2	2	7	Of that triad, viz. bones, marrow, and joints, there are
3	2	2	540	(parts) on this side (the right), and
3	2	2	540	on that side (the left). They make
3	2	2	1080	together, and
3	2	2	1080	are the rays of the sun. They make the Brihatî verses and the day (of the Mahâvrata) .
3	2	2	8	Thus that self which consists of sight, hearing, metre, mind, and speech is like unto the syllables.
3	2	2	9	He who knows this self which consists of sight, hearing, metre, mind, and speech, as like unto syllables, obtains union, likeness, or nearness with the syllables, has sons and cattle, and lives his full age.
3	2	3	1	Bâdhva  says, there are four persons (to be meditated on and worshipped).
3	2	3	2	The person of the body, the person of the metres, the person of the Veda, and the Great person.
3	2	3	3	What we call the person of the body is this corporeal self. Its essence is the incorporeal conscious self.
3	2	3	4	What we call the person of the metres is this collection of letters (the Veda). Its essence is the vowel a.
3	2	3	5	What we call the person of the Veda is (the mind) by which we know the Vedas, the Rig-veda, Yagur-veda, and Sâma-veda. Its essence is Brahman (m.)
3	2	3	6	Therefore let one chose a Brahman-priest who is full of Brahman (the Veda), and is able to see any flaw in the sacrifice.
3	2	3	7	What we call the Great person is the year, which causes some beings to fall together, and causes others to grow up. Its essence is yonder sun.
3	2	3	8	One should know that the incorporeal conscious self and yonder sun are both one and the same. Therefore the sun appears to every man singly (and differently).
3	2	3	9	This has also been declared by a Rishi :--
3	2	3	10	'The bright face of the gods arose, the eye of Mitra, Varuna, and Agni; it filled heaven and earthand the sky,--the sun is the self of all that rests and moves.'
3	2	3	11	'This I think to be the regular Samhitâ as conceived by me,' thus said Bâdhva.
3	2	3	12	For the Bahvrikas consider him (the self) in the great hymn (mahad uktha), the Adhvaryus in the sacrificial fire, the Khandogas in the Mahâvrata ceremony. Him they see in this earth, in heaven, in the air, in the ether, in the water, in herbs, in trees, in the moon, in the stars, in all beings. Him alone they call Brahman.
3	2	3	13	That self which consists of sight, hearing, metre, mind, and speech is like unto the year.
3	2	3	14	He who recites to another that self which consists of sight, hearing, metre, mind, and speech, and is like unto the year,
3	2	4	1	To him the Vedas yield no more milk, he has no luck in what he has learnt (from his Guru); he does not know the path of virtue.
3	2	4	2	This has also been declared by a Rishi :--
3	2	4	3	'He who has forsaken the friend (the Veda), that knows his friends, in his speech there is no luck. Though he hears, he hears in vain, for he does not know the path of virtue.'
3	2	4	4	Here it is clearly said that he has no luck in what he has learnt, and that he does not know the path of virtue.
3	2	4	5	Therefore let no one who knows this, lay the sacrificial fire (belonging to the Mahâvrata) for another, let him not sing the Sâmans of the Mahâvratafor another, let him not recite the Sastras of that day for another.
3	2	4	6	However, let him willingly do this for a father or for an Âkârya; for that is done really for himself.
3	2	4	7	We have said that the incorporeal conscious self and the sun are one . When these two become separated , the sun is seen as if it were the moon ; no rays spring from it; the sky is red like madder; the patient cannot retain the wind, his head smells bad like a raven's nest:--let him know then that his self (in the body) is gone, and that he will not live very long .
3	2	4	8	Then whatever he thinks he has to do,. let him do it, and let him recite the following hymns: Yad anti yak ka dûrake ; Ad it pratnasya retasah ; Yatra brahmâ pavamâna ; Ud vayam tamasas pari .
3	2	4	9	Next, when the sun is seen pierced, and seems like the nave of a cart-wheel, when he sees his own shadow pierced, let him know then that it is so (as stated before, i. e. that he is going to die soon).
3	2	4	10	Next, when he sees himself in a mirror or in the water with a crooked head, or without a head , or when his pupils are seen inverted  or not straight, let him know then that it is so.
3	2	4	11	Next, let him cover his eyes and watch, then threads are seen as if falling together . But if he does not see them, let him know then that it is so.
3	2	4	12	Next, let him cover his ears and listen, and there will be a sound as if of a burning fire or of a carriage . But if he does not hear it, let him know then that it is so.
3	2	4	13	Next, when fire looks blue like the neck of a peacock , or when he sees lightning in a cloudless sky, or no lightning in a clouded sky, or when he sees as it were bright rays in a dark cloud, let him know then that it is so.
3	2	4	14	Next, when he sees the ground as if it were burning, let him know that it is so.
3	2	4	15	These are the visible signs .
3	2	4	16	Next come the dreams .
3	2	4	17	If he sees a black man with black teeth, and that man kills him; or a boar kills him; a monkey jumps on  him; the wind carries him along quickly; having swallowed gold he spits it out ; he eats honey; he chews stalks; he carries a red lotus; he drives with asses and boars; wearing a wreath of red flowers (naladas) he drives a black cow with a black calf, facing the south ,
3	2	4	18	If a man sees any one of these (dreams), lethim fast, and cook a pot of milk, sacrifice it, accompanying each oblation with a verse of the Râtri hymn , and then, after having fed the Brâhmanas, with other food (prepared at his house) eat himself the (rest of the) oblation.
3	2	4	19	Let him know that the person within all beings, not heard here , not reached, not thought, not subdued, not seen, not understood, not classed, but hearing, thinking, seeing, classing, sounding, understanding, knowing, is his Self.
3	2	5	1	Now next the Upanishad of the whole speech.True all these are Upanishads of the whole speech, but this they call so (chiefly).
3	2	5	2	The mute consonants represent the earth, the sibilants the sky, the vowels heaven.The mute consonants represent Agni (fire), the sibilants air, the vowels the sun.The mute consonants represent the Rig-veda, the sibilants the Yagur-veda, the vowels the Sâma-veda.The mute consonants represent the eye, the sibilants the ear, the vowels the mind.The mute consonants represent the up-breathing, the sibilants the down-breathing, the vowels the back-breathing.
3	2	5	3	Next comes this divine lute (the human body, made by the gods). The lute made by man is an imitation of it.
3	2	5	4	As there is a head of this, so there is a head of that (lute, made by man). As there is a stomachof this, so there is the cavity  (In the board) of that. As there is a tongue of this, so there is a tongue  in that. As there are fingers of this, so there are strings of that . As there are vowels of this, so there are tones of that. As there are consonants of this, so there are touches of that. As this is endowed with sound and firmly strung, so that is endowed with sound and firmly strung. As this is covered with a hairy skin, so that is covered with a hairy skin.
3	2	5	5	Verily, in former times they covered a lute with a hairy skin.
3	2	5	6	He who knows this lute made by the Devas (and meditates on it), is willingly listened to, his glory fills the earth, and wherever they speak Âryan languages, there they know him.
3	2	5	7	Next follows the verse, called vâgrasa, the essence of speech. When a man reciting or speaking in an assembly does not please, let him say this verse:
3	2	5	8	'May the queen of all speech, who is covered, as it were, by the lips, surrounded by teeth, as if by spears, who is a thunderbolt, help me to speak well.' This is the vâgrasa, the essence of speech.
3	2	6	1	Next Krishna-Hârita  confided this Brâhmana  concerning speech to him (his pupil):
3	2	6	2	Pragâpati, the year, after having sent forth all creatures, burst. He put himself together again by means of khandas (Vedas). Because he put himself together again by means of khandas, therefore (the text of the Veda) is called Samhitâ (put together).
3	2	6	3	Of that Samhitâ the letter n is the strength, the letter sh the breath and self (Âtman).
3	2	6	4	He who knows the Rik verses and the letters n and sh for every Samhitâ, he knows the Samhitâ with strength and breath. Let him know that this is the life of the Samhitâ.
3	2	6	5	If the pupil asks, 'Shall I say it with the letter n or without it? 'let the teacher say, 'With the letter n.' And if he asks, 'Shall I say it with the letter sh or without it?' let the teacher say, 'With the letter sh .'
3	2	6	6	Hrasva Mândûkeya said: 'If we here recite the verses according to the Samhitâ (attending to the necessary changes of n and s into n and sh ), and if we say the adhyâya of Mândûkeya , then the letters n and sh (strength and breath) have by this been obtained for us.'
3	2	6	7	Sthavira Sâkalya said: 'If we recite the verses according to the Samhitâ, and if we say the adhyâya of Mândûkeya, then the letters n and sh have by this been obtained for us.'
3	2	6	8	Here the Rishis, the Kâvasheyas , knowingthis, said: 'Why should we repeat (the Veda), why should we sacrifice? We offer as a sacrifice breath in speech, or speech in breath. What is the beginning (of one), that is the end (of the other).'
3	2	6	9	Let no one tell these Samhitâs  to one who is not a resident pupil, who has not been with his teacher at least one year, and who is not himself to become an instructor . Thus say the teachers, yea, thus say the teachers.
 
 , and then rest in another place finishing it.
3	2	6	11	'And in the place where he reads this, he should not read  anything else, though he may read this (the Mahâvrata) where he has read something else.
3	2	6	12	'No one should bathe and become a snâtaka  who does not read this. Even if he has read many other things, he should not become a snâtaka if he has not read this.
3	2	6	13	'Nor should he forget it, and even if he should forget anything else, he should not forget this.
3	2	6	14	'No, he should never forget this.
3	2	6	15	'If he does not forget this, it will be enough for himself (or for acquiring a knowledge of the Self).
3	2	6	16	'It is enough, let him know this to be true.
3	2	6	17	'Let him who knows this not communicate, nor dine, nor amuse himself with any one who does not know it.'Then follow some more rules as to the reading of the Veda in general:
3	2	6	18	'When the old water that stood round the roots of trees is dried up (after about the month of Pausha, January to February ) he should not read; nor (at any time) in the morning or in the afternoon, when the shadows meet (he should begin at sunrise so soon as the shadows divide, and end in the evening before they fall together). Nor should he read  when a cloud has risen; and when there is an unseasonable rain (after the months of Srâvana and Bhâdrapada, August and September ) he should stop his Vedic reading for three nights. Nor should he at that time tell stories, not even during the night, nor should he glory in his knowledge.
3	2	6	19	'This (the Veda thus learnt and studied) is the name of that Great Being; and he who thus knows the name of that Great Being, he becomes Brahman, yea, he becomes Brahman.'
