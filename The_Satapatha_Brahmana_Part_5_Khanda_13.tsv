1	1	1	He (the Adhvaryu) cooks the priests’ mess of rice : it is seed he thereby produces. Having greased a rope with the ghee which is left over , he takes it; for ghee is (a type of) fiery spirit, and the horse is sacred to Pragâpati : he thus endows Pragâpati with fiery spirit. Impure, and unfit for sacrifice, indeed, is that (animal), to wit, the horse.
1	1	2	The rope consists of darbha grass (poa cynosuroides);--for darbha stalks  are a means of purification: he thus purifies that (horse), and immolates it as one purified and meet for sacrifice.
1	1	3	Now, when the horse  was immolated, itsseed went from it and became gold : thus, when he gives gold (to the priests) he supplies the horse with seed.
1	1	4	Pragâpati produced the sacrifice . His greatness departed from him, and entered the great sacrificial priests . Together with the great priests he went in search of it, and together with the great priests he found it: when the great priests eat the priests’ mess of rice, the Sacrificer thereby secures for himself the greatness of the sacrifice. Along with the priests’ mess of rice he presents gold (to the priests); for the mess of rice is seed, and gold is seed: by means of seed he thus lays seed into that (horse, and Sacrificer). It (the gold ) weighs a hundred (grains); for man has a life of a hundred (years), and a hundred energies: it is life, and energy, vigour, he lays into his own self. At midday he takes Vasatîvarî  water of four kinds; it is brought together from the (four) quarters, for food is in (all) the (four) quarters, and water is food: by means of food he thus secures food for him.
1	2	1	Now, unsuccessful in the sacrifice, assuredly, is what is performed without a formula.  'This rope did they take, at the first age of the truth, ,' he takes the halter of the horse in order to supply a formula for the success of the sacrifice. It (the rope) is twelve cubits long,--twelve months make a year: it is the year, the sacrifice , he secures.
1	2	2	Concerning this they say, 'Is the rope to be made twelve cubits long, or thirteen cubits long?' Well, that year is the bull among the seasons, and the thirteenth (or intercalary) month is an excrescence of the year; and this Asvamedha is the bull among sacrifices; and inasmuch as the bull has an excrescence (hump), one may add on a thirteenth cubit to the rope as an excrescence to this (Asvamedha): even as the bull's hump is attached  (to his back), suchlike would this be.
1	2	3	'Encompassing  thou art,'--therefore the offerer of the Asvamedha conquers all the quarters ;--'the world thou art,'--the world he thus conquers;--'a ruler thou art, an upholder,'--he thus makes him a ruler and upholder;--'go thou unto Agni Vaisvânara,'--he thus makes him go to Agni Vaisvânara (the friend of all men);--'of wide extent,'--he thus causes him to extend in offspring and cattle;--'consecrated by Svâhâ (hail!),'--this is the Vashat-call  for it;--'good speed (to) thee for the gods!'--he thus makes it of good speed for the gods;--'for Pragâpati,'--the horse is sacred to Pragâpati: he thus supplies  it with his own deity.
1	2	4	But, verily, he who fetters the horse without announcing it to the Brahman and the gods is liable to incur injury. He addresses the Brahman (the superintending priest) by saying, 'O Brahman, I will fetter the horse for the gods, for Pragâpati: may I prosper therewith!' and having made the announcementto the Brahman, he ties up the horse, and thus incurs no injury. 'Fetter it for the gods, for Pragâpati: prosper thou therewith!' thus the Brahman urges him, and supplies it (the horse) with its own deity. He then sprinkles it (with water): the (symbolic) meaning of this is the same as before .
1	2	5	He sprinkles  it, with , 'I sprinkle thee (so as to be) acceptable to Pragâpati,'--for Pragâpati is the most vigorous of the gods: it is vigour he bestows on it, whence the horse is the most vigorous of animals.
1	2	6	'I sprinkle thee, acceptable to Indra and Agni,'--for Indra and Agni are the most powerful of the gods: it is power he bestows on it, whence the horse is the most powerful of animals.
1	2	7	'I sprinkle thee, acceptable to Vâyu,'--for Vâyu is the swiftest of gods: it is speed he bestows on it, whence the horse is the swiftest of animals.
1	2	8	'I sprinkle thee, acceptable to the All-gods,'--for the All-gods are the most famous of gods: it is fame he bestows on it, whence the horse is the most famous of animals,---'I sprinkle thee, acceptable to all the gods.'
1	2	9	Concerning this they say, 'Seeing that the horse is sacred to Pragâpati, wherefore (does he say), "I sprinkle thee" for other deities also?' Well, all the gods are concerned in the horse-sacrifice;when he says, 'I sprinkle thee for all the gods,' he makes all the gods take a concern in the horse-sacrifice; whence all the gods are concerned in the horse-sacrifice. But his wicked enemy seeks to lay hold of him who performs the horse-sacrifice, and the horse is a thunderbolt;--having killed the four-eyed dog, he--with 'Undone  is the man! undone is the dog!'--plunges  it under the horse's feet: it is by means of the thunderbolthe thus stamps him down; and the wicked enemy does not lay hold of him.
1	3	1	Even as some of the havis (offering-material) may be spilled before it is offered, so also (part) of the victim is here spilled in that they let loose the sprinkled (horse) before it is slain. When he offers the Stokîyâs (oblations of drops), he offers that (horse) as a complete offering --so as to make good any spilling ; for unspilled is any (part) of the offered (material) that is spilled. A thousand (oblations of drops) he offers for the obtainment of the heavenly world, for the heavenly world is equal in extent to a thousand.
1	3	2	Concerning this they say, 'Were he to offer measured (a specified number of oblations), he would gain for himself something limited:' he offers unspecified (oblations) for the obtainment of the unlimited. And indeed Pragâpati spake, 'Verily, upon the oblations of drops I establish the Asvamedha, and by it, when established, I pass upward from hence.'
1	3	3	'To Agni, hail!'--to Agni he thus offers it (the horse );--'to Soma, hail!'--to Soma he thus offers it;--'to the joy of the waters, hail!'--to the waters he thus offers it;--'to Savitri, hail!'--to Savitrihe thus offers it;--'to Vâyu, hail!'--to Vâyu (the wind) he thus offers it;--'to Vishnu, hail!'--to Vishnu he thus offers it to;--'Indra, hail!'--to Indra he thus offers it;--'to Brihaspati, hail!'--to Brihaspati he thus offers it;--'to Mitra, hail!'--to Mitra he thus offers it;--'to Varuna, hail!'--to Varuna he thus offers it:--so many, doubtless, are all the gods: it is to them he offers it. He offers them straight away  for the obtainment of the heavenly world, for straight away, as it were, is the heavenly world.
1	3	4	But, verily, he who offers the oblations straight away, would be liable to fall (pass) right away : he turns back again , and establishes himself in this (terrestrial) world. And this  indeed he (Pragâpati) has declared to be the perfection of the sacrifice, so as to prevent falling away (spilling), for unspilled is what is spilled of the offered (material).
1	3	5	And even as some of the offering-material may be spilled before it is offered, so also (part) of thevictim is here spilled in that they let loose the sprinkled (horse) before it is slaughtered. When he offers (the oblations relating to) the Forms  (rûpa), he offers that (horse) as one that is wholly offered, so as to make good any spilling; for unspilled is what is spilled of the offered (material). With ,'To the Hiṅ-call, hail! to the (horse) consecrated by Hiṅ, hail! . . .' (he offers them); for these are the forms (qualities) of the horse: it is them he now obtains.
1	3	6	Concerning this they say, 'The Forms are no offering: they should not be offered.' But, indeed, they also say, 'Therein assuredly the horse-sacrifice becomes complete that he performs (the oblations relating to) the Forms: they should certainly be offered.' And, indeed, one puts that (Sacrificer) out of his resting-place, and raises a rival for him when one offers for him oblations elsewhere than in the fire , where there is no resting-place.
1	3	7	Prior to the (first) oblation to Savitri , he (the Adhvaryu) offers, once only, (the oblations relating to) the Forms  in the Âhavanîya, whilst going rapidly over (the formulas): he thus offers the oblations at his (the Sacrificer's) resting-place, and raises no rival for him. He offers at each opening of sacrifice , for the continuity and uninterrupted performance of the sacrifice.
1	3	8	Concerning this they say, 'Were he to offerat each opening of sacrifice, he would be deprived of his cattle, and would become poorer.' They should be performed once only: thus he is not deprived of his cattle, and does not become poorer. Forty-eight (oblations) he offers;--the Gagatî consists of forty-eight syllables, and cattle are of Gâgata (movable) nature: by means of the Gagatî he (the Adhvaryu) thus wins cattle for him (the Sacrificer). One additional (oblation) he offers, whence one man is apt to thrive amongst (many) creatures (or subjects).
1	4	1	Pragâpati poured forth the life-sap of the horse (asva-medha) . When poured forth, it went straight away from him and spread itself over the regions. The gods went in quest of it. By means of offerings (ishti) they followed it up, by offerings they searched for it, and by offerings they found it. And when he performs ishtis, the Sacrificer thereby searches for the horse (asva) meet for sacrifice  (medhya).
1	4	2	They (the ishtis ) belong to Savitri; for Savitri is this (earth): if any one hides himself thereon, if any one goes elsewhere , it is on this (earth) that they find him; for no one (creature), whether walking erect or horizontally (like an animal), is able to go beyond it. Their belonging to Savitri thus is in order to find the horse.
1	4	3	Concerning this they say, 'Surely the horse disappears when it goes straight away; for they do not turn (drive) it back .' Now when he performs the Dhriti offerings  in the evening--dhriti (keeping) meaning peaceful dwelling, and the night also meaning peaceful dwelling--it is by means of peaceful dwelling that he keeps it; whence both men and beasts rest peacefully at night. And when he performs offerings in the morning, he seeks that (horse); whence it is in daytime that one goes to seek for what is lost. And again when he offers the Dhritis in the evening, and the (Savitri) ishtis in the morning, it is security of possession the Sacrificer thereby brings about, whence security of possession is brought about for the subjects where this sacrifice is performed.
1	5	1	But, indeed, distinction, royal sway, departs from him who performs the horse-sacrifice; and when a man attains to distinction, the lute is played to him. Two Brâhmanical lute-players sing (and play) for a year; for that--to wit, the lute--is a form (attribute) of distinction: it is distinction they thus confer upon him.
1	5	2	Concerning this they say, ‘Were both to be Brâhmanas who sing, noble rank (or political power) would depart from him; for he--to wit, a Brâhmana--is a form of the priestly office; and the nobility takes no delight in the priestly office (or priesthood).
1	5	3	‘And were both to be Râganyas (nobles), spiritual lustre would depart from him; for he--to wit, the Râganya--is a form of noble rank, and spiritual lustre takes no delight in noble rank.' One of those who sing is a Brâhmana, and the other a Râganya; for the Brâhmana means priestly office, and the Râganya noble rank: thus his distinction (social position) comes to be guarded on either side by the priesthood and the nobility.
1	5	4	Concerning this they say, ‘Were both to sing by day, his distinction would be apt to fall away from him: for that--to wit, the day--is a form of the priestly dignity; and when the king chooses he may oppress (despoil) the Brâhmana, but he will fare the worse (or, become the poorer) for it.
1	5	5	'And if both (were to sing) at night, spiritual lustre would fall away from him; for that--to wit, the night--is a form of the nobility, and spiritual lustre takes no delight in the nobility.' The Brâhmana sings by day , and the Râganya at night ; and thus, indeed, his distinction comes to be guarded on either side by the priesthood and the nobility .
1	5	6	'Such sacrifices he offered,--such gifts he gave!' such (are the topics about which) the Brâhmana sings ; for to the Brâhmana belongs the fulfilment of wishes : it is with the fulfilment of wishes he (the Brâhmana) thus endows him (the Sacrificer). 'Such war he waged,--such battle he won!' such (are the topics about which) the Râganya sings; for the battle is the Râganya's strength: it is with strength he thus endows him. Three stanzas the one sings, and three stanzas the other, they amount to six,--six seasons make up a year: he thus establishes (the Sacrificer) in the seasons, in the year. To both of them he presents a hundred; for man has a life of a hundred (years), and a hundred energies: it is vitality and energy, vital power, he confers upon him.
1	6	1	'Plenteous by the mother, strengthful by the father,'--its mother, doubtless, is this (earth), and its father yonder (sky): it is to these two he commits it;--'a horse thou art, a steed thou art,'--he thereby instructs it, whence clever subjects (or children) are born to him;--'a courser (atya) thou art, a charger thou art,'--he therewith leads it beyond (ati), whence the horse goes beyond (surpasses) other animals, and whence the horse attains to pre-eminence among animals;--'a runner thou art, a racer thou art, a prize-winner thouart,'--in accordance with the text is (the meaning of) this;--'a male thou art, well-disposed towards man thou art,'--this is with a view to its (or, his) being supplied with a mate;--'Speedy thou art called, Child thou art called,'--this is the horse's favourite name: by its favourite name he thus addresses it; whence even if two enemies , on meeting together, address one another by name, they get on amicably together.
1	6	2	'Go thou along the way of the Âdityas!'--to the Âdityas he thus makes it go.--'Ye divine guardians of the quarters, protect this horse, sprinkled for sacrifice to the gods!'--the guardians of the quarters are a hundred princes born in wedlock: to them he commits it;--'here is joy: here let it rejoice!--here is safe keeping, here is its own safe keeping, hail!' For a year he offers the (four Dhriti) oblations --(amounting to) sixteen nineties, for they are the horse's chain , and it is therewith alone that he chains it; whence the horse when let loose returns to its chain: (they amount to) sixteen nineties ; for these (oblations of safe keeping) are the horse's chain, and it is therewith alone that he chains it, whence the horse, when let loose, does not (entirely) abandon its chain.
1	6	3	Verily, the Asvamedha means royal sway: it is after royal sway that these strive who guard the horse. Those of them who reach the end become (sharers in) the royal sway, but those who do not reach the end are cut off from royal sway. Wherefore let him who holds royal sway perform the horse-sacrifice; for, verily, whosoever performs the horse-sacrifice, without possessing power, is poured (swept) away.--Now, were unfriendly, men to get hold of the horse, his sacrifice would be cut in twain, and he would become the poorer for it. A hundred men clad in armour guard it for the continuity and uninterrupted performance of the sacrifice; and he will not become the poorer for it; (but if it be lost) they should fetch another (horse), and sprinkle it: this is the expiation in that case.
1	7	1	Pragâpati desired, 'Might I perform a horse-sacrifice ?' He toiled and practised fervid devotion. From the body of him, when wearied and heated, the deities departed in a sevenfold way: therefrom the Dîkshâ (initiation) was produced. He perceived those Vaisvadeva  (oblations). He offeredthem, and by means of them he gained the Dîkshâ: and when the Sacrificer offers the Vaisvadeva (oblations) it is the Dîkshâ he thereby gains. Day after day he offers them: day after day he thus gains the Dîkshâ . Seven of them he offers; for seven were those deities that departed (from Pragâpati); it is by means of them that he (the priest) gains the Dîkshâ for him.
1	7	2	But, indeed, the vital airs depart from those who exceed (the duration of) the Dîkshâ. Forseven days they observe it; for there are seven (outlets of) vital airs in the head, and the Dîkshâ is the vital airs: it is by means of the vital airs he gains the Dîkshâ, the vital airs, for him. He makes offering by dividing (each) deity into three parts ; for the gods are of three orders , and of three orders are these worlds: he thus establishes himself in these worlds in prosperity and vital power.
1	7	3	They amount to one and twenty (single invocations and oblations),--there are twelve months, five seasons, these three worlds, and yonder sun as the twenty-first,--that is the divine ruling-power, that is the glory: that supreme lordship, that summit of the fallow one (the Sun), that realm of light he attains.
1	7	4	Thirty Audgrabhanas  he offers,--of thirty syllables the Virâg (metre) consists, and the Virâg means all food: thus (he offers) for the obtainment of all food. Four Audgrabhanas he offers (on each day), and three Vaisvadevas;--they amount to seven; for there are seven vital airs of the head, and the Dîkshâ is the vital airs: by means of the vital airs he thus gains the Dîkshâ, the vital airs,for him. A full (-spoon)-oblation  he offers last for the sake of invigoration and union.
1	8	1	Pragâpati poured forth the life-sap of the horse . When poured forth, it weighed down the rik (hymn-verse) and the sâman (hymn-tune). The Vaisvadeva (offerings) upheld that (Asvamedha): thus, when he offers the Vaisvadevas, it is for the upholding of the Asvamedha.
1	8	2	With , 'To Ka hail! To the Who hail! To the Whoever hail!' he makes the one relating to Pragâpati the first (or chief one), and thus upholds (the Asvamedha) by means of the deities with Pragâpati as their chief.
1	8	3	'Hail, meditation (we give) unto him meditated upon! Hail, the mind unto the Lord of creatures! Hail, thought unto him, the known !' what the mystic sense of the former (utterances ) was that it is here.
1	8	4	'To Aditi hail! To Aditi, the mighty, hail! To Aditi, the most merciful, hail!' Aditi, doubtless, is this (earth): it is by her that he upholds it.
1	8	5	'To Sarasvatî hail! To Sarasvatî, the pure, hail! To Sarasvatî, the great, hail!' Sarasvatî, doubtless, is speech: by speech he thus upholds it.
1	8	6	'To Pûshan hail! To Pûshan, the protector of travellers, hail! To Pûshan, the watcher of men, hail!' Pûshan, doubtless, is cattle: by means of cattle he thus upholds it.
1	8	7	'To Tvashtri hail! To Tvashtri, the seminal, hail! To Tvashtri, the multiform hail!' Tvashtri, doubtless, is the fashioner of the couples of animals: by means of forms he thus upholds it.
1	8	8	'To Vishnu hail! To Vishnu, the protector of what grows , hail! To Vishnu, the bald , hail!' Vishnu, doubtless, is the sacrifice: by sacrifice he thus upholds it. With , 'Let every mortal espouse the friendship of the divine guide, . . . ,' he offers last of all a full (-spoon)-oblation; for the full-offering is this (earth): he thus finally establishes himself on this (earth).
1	9	1	, 'In the priestly office (brahman) may the Brâhmana be born, endowed with spiritual lustre (brahmavarkasa):' on the Brâhmana he thereby bestows spiritual lustre, whence of old the Brâhmana was born as one endowed with spiritual lustre .
1	9	2	'In the royal order may the Râganya be born, heroic, skilled in archery, sure of his mark, and a mighty car-fighter:' on the Râganya he thereby bestows the grandeur of heroism , whence of old the Râganya was born as one heroic, skilled in archery, certain of his mark, and a mighty car-fighter.
1	9	3	'The milch cow:' on the cow he thereby bestows milk; whence of old the cow was born as one yielding milk.
1	9	4	'The draught ox:' on the ox he thereby bestows strength, whence of old the ox was born as a draught (animal).
1	9	5	'The swift racer:' on the horse he thereby bestows speed, whence of old the horse was born as a runner.
1	9	6	'The well-favoured woman:' on the womanhe thereby bestows beautiful form, whence the beautiful maiden is apt to become dear (to men).
1	9	7	'The victorious warrior:' on the Râganya he thereby bestows the grandeur of victoriousness , whence of old the Râganya was born as one victorious.
1	9	8	'The blitheful youth:' he, indeed, is a blitheful (or, sociable) youth who is in his prime of life; whence one who is in his prime of life is apt to become dear to women.
1	9	9	'May a hero be born unto this Sacrificer!' on the Sacrificer's family he thereby bestows manly vigour, whence of old a hero was born to him who had performed the (Asvamedha) sacrifice.
1	9	10	'May Parganya rain for us whensoever we list!'--where they perform this sacrifice, there Parganya, indeed, rains whenever they list;--'may our fruit-bearing plants ripen!'--there the fruit-bearing plants indeed ripen where they perform this sacrifice;--'may security of possession be assured for us!'--where they perform this sacrifice there security of possession indeed is assured; whence wherever they perform this (Asvamedha) sacrifice, security of possession becomes assured to the people.
2	1	1	Pragâpati assigned the sacrifices to the gods; the Asvamedha he kept for himself. The godssaid to him, 'Surely, this--to wit, the Asvamedha--is a sacrifice: let us have a share in that also.' He contrived these Anna-homas (food-oblations) for them: thus when he performs the Annahomas, it is the gods he thereby gratifies.
2	1	2	With ghee he makes offering, for ghee is fiery mettle: by means of fiery mettle he thus lays fiery mettle into him (the horse and Sacrificer). With ghee he offers; for that--to wit, ghee--is the gods’ favourite resource: it is thus with their favourite resource he supplies them.
2	1	3	With parched groats he makes offering; for that--to wit, parched groats--are a form of the gods : it is the gods he thus gratifies.
2	1	4	With grain he makes offering; for this--to wit, grain--is a form of the days and nights : it is the days and nights he thus gratifies.
2	1	5	With parched grain he makes offering; for this--to wit, parched grain--is a form of the Nakshatras  (lunar asterisms): it is the Nakshatrashe thus gratifies. He offers whilst mentioning names, with , 'To the in- (and out-) breathing hail! to the off-breathing hail !' . . . he thus gratifies them by mentioning their names. , 'To one hail! to two hail! . . . to a hundred hail! to a hundred and one hail!' He offers in the proper order: in the proper order he thus gratifies them (the gods). He performs oblations successively increasing by one , for single, indeed, is heaven: singly he thus causes him (the Sacrificer) to reach heaven. Straight away  he offers in order to the winning of heaven; for straight away, as it were, is heaven.
2	1	6	But, verily, he who offers the oblations straightaway , is liable to fall (pass) right away. He does not go beyond a hundred and one: were he to go beyond a hundred and one, he would deprive the Sacrificer of his vital power. He offers a hundred and one, for man has a life of a hundred (years), and his own self is the one hundred and first: he thus establishes himself in a self (or body), in vital power. With 'To the Dawn hail! to Heaven hail!' he offers the two last oblations; for the dawn is the night, and heaven (the realm of light) is the day: it is day and night he thus gratifies.
2	1	7	As to this they say, 'Were he to offer both either by day or by night, he would confound day and night with one another .' With 'To the Dawn hail!' he offers before the sun has risen, and with 'To Heaven hail' when it has risen, to avoid confusion between day and night.
2	2	1	Verily, this--to wit, the Asvamedha--is the king of sacrifices. But, indeed, the Asvamedha is the Sacrificer, (for) the sacrifice is the Sacrificer: when he (the priest) binds victims to the horse (or, at the horse-sacrifice), he then, indeed, takes hold  of the sacrifice at the sacrifice.
2	2	2	'A horse, a hornless he-goat, and a Gomriga 'these they bind to the central stake: thereby, indeed, he (the priest) sharpens the front of his (the Sacrificer's) army , whence the front of the king's army is sure to become terrible.
2	2	3	A black-necked (he-goat), sacred to Agni, in front (of the horse) to its forehead : the original (hall) fire he makes it, whence the king's hall-fire is sure to be (efficient) .
2	2	4	An ewe, for Sarasvatî, beneath the (horse's) jaws: he thereby makes women to be dependent, whence women are sure to be attendant upon man.
2	2	5	Two (he-goats), black on the lower part of the body , for the Asvins, (he ties) to the front legs: he thereby lays strength into the front legs, whence the king is sure to be strong in the arm .
2	2	6	A dark-grey (he-goat) for Soma and Pûshan at the (horse's) navel: a foothold he makes this one; for Pûshan is this (earth): it is thereon he establishes himself.
2	2	7	A white one and a black one, for Sûrya and Yama, on the flanks: a suit of armour he makes those two: whence the king, clad in mail, performs heroic deeds.
2	2	8	Two, with shaggy hind thighs, for Tvashtri, to the hind legs: he lays strength into the thighs, whence the king is sure to be strong in his thighs.
2	2	9	A white one, for Vâyu, to the tail,--an elevation he makes this one, whence people in danger betake themselves to an elevated place ;--a cow wont to cast her calf, for Indra, the ever active, in order to associate the sacrifice with Indra;--a dwarfish one for Vishnu; for Vishnu is the sacrifice: it is in the sacrifice he (the Sacrificer) thus finally establishes himself.
2	2	10	These, then, are the fifteen 'paryaṅgya' (body-encircling)  animals,--for fifteenfold is thethunderbolt, and the thunderbolt means manly vigour: with that thunderbolt, manly vigour, the Sacrificer now repels evil from in front  (of the sacrifice).
2	2	11	And fifteen (victims), indeed, are (bound) to each of the other (stakes);--for fifteenfold is the thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt means manly vigour: with that thunderbolt, manly vigour, the Sacrificer now repels evil on both sides  (of the sacrifice).
2	2	12	As to this they say, 'Does he really repel evil by these?' And, indeed, he does not make up the complete Pragâpati, and does not here gain everything.
2	2	13	Let him rather bind seventeen animals to the central stake ; for seventeenfold is Pragâpati, and the Asvamedha is Pragâpati,--thus for theobtainment of the Asvamedha. And sixteen (victims he binds) to each of the other (stakes), for of sixteen parts (kalâ) consists all this  (universe); all this (universe) he thus gains.
2	2	14	'How is he to appease  these?' they ask. 'Let him appease them with the Bârhaduktha verses , "Enkindled, anointing the lap of the faithful(f.) . . .;" for Brihaduktha, the son of Vâmadeva, or Asva, son of Samudra, saw these very (verses) to be the âprî-verses of the horse: it is by means of these we appease it,' so they say. But let him not do so; let him appease it with the Gâmadagna verses; for Gamadagni is Pragâpati, and so is the Asvamedha: he thus supplies it with its own deity; let him therefore appease (the victims) with the Gâmadagna verses .
2	2	15	Now some make the invitatory-formulas and the offering-formulas (to be pronounced) separately for the 'paryaṅgyas,' saying, 'For these we find (formulas)--for the others, on account of not finding any, we do not use them .' Let him not do so;for the horse is the nobility (chieftain), and the other animals are the peasantry (clan); and those who do this really make the peasantry equal and refractory to the nobility; and they also deprive the Sacrificer of his vital power. Therefore the horse alone belongs to Pragâpati , and the others are sacred to the gods: he thus, indeed, makes the peasantry obedient and subservient to the nobility; and he also supplies the Sacrificer with vital power.
2	2	16	The slaughtering-knife of the horse is made of gold, those of the 'paryaṅgyas' of copper, and those of the others of iron; for gold is (shining) light, and the Asvamedha is the royal office: he thus bestows light upon the royal office. And by means of the golden light (or, by the light of the gold), the Sacrificer also goes to the heavenly world; and he, moreover, makes it a gleam of light shining after him, for him to reach the heavenly world.
2	2	17	But, indeed, the horse is also the nobility; and this also--to wit, gold--is a form (symbol) ofthe nobility: he thus combines the nobility with the nobility.
2	2	18	And as to why there are copper (knives) for the 'paryaṅgyas,'--even as the non-royal kingmakers, the heralds and headmen, are to the king, so those 'paryaṅgyas' are to the horse; and so, indeed, is this--to wit, copper--to gold: with their own form he thus endows them.
2	2	19	And as to why there are iron ones for the others,--the other animals, indeed, are the peasantry, and this--to wit, iron--is a form of the peasantry: he thus combines the peasantry with the peasantry. On a rattan mat (lying) north (of the Âhavanîya) they cut the portions of the horse(-flesh); for the horse is of anushtubh nature, and related to the Anushtubh is that (northern) quarter: he thus places that (horse) in its own quarter. And as to (his doing so) on a rattan mat,--the horse was produced from the womb of the waters , and the rattan springs from the water: he thus causes it to be possessed of its own (maternal) womb.
2	3	1	Now, the gods did not know the Pavamâna  at the Asvamedha to be the heavenly world, but the horse knew it. When, at the Asvamedha,they glide along  with the horse for the Pavamâna (-stotra), it is for getting to know (the way to) the heavenly world; and they hold on to the horse's tail, in order to reach the heavenly world; for man does not rightly know (the way to) the heavenly world, but the horse does rightly know it
2	3	2	Were the Udgâtri to chant the Udgîtha , it would be even as if one who does not know the country were to lead by another (than the right) way. But if, setting aside the Udgâtri, he choosesthe horse for (performing) the Udgîtha, it is just as when one who knows the country leads on the right way: the horse leads the Sacrificer rightly to the heavenly world. It makes 'Hiṅ ,' and thereby makes the. Sâman itself to be 'hiṅ': this is the Udgîtha. They pen up mares, (and on seeing the horse) they utter a shrill sound: as when the chanters sing, such like is this. The priests’ fee is gold weighing a hundred (grains): the mystic import of this has been explained .
2	4	1	Pragâpati desired, 'Would that I might gain both worlds, the world of the gods, and the world of men.' He saw those beasts, the tame and the wild ones; he seized them, and by means of them took possession of these two worlds: by means of the tame beasts he took possession of this (terrestrial) world, and by means of the wild beasts of yonder (world); for this world is the world of men, and yonder world is the world of the gods. Thus when he seizes tame beasts he thereby takes possession of this world, and when wild beasts, he thereby (takes possession) of yonder (world).
2	4	2	Were he to complete (the sacrifice) with tame ones, the roads would run together , the village-boundariesof two villages would be contiguous , and no ogres , man-tigers, thieves, murderers, and robbers would come to be in the forests. By (so doing) with wild (beasts) the roads would run asunder , the village-boundaries of two villages would be far asunder ; and there would come to be ogres, man-tigers, thieves, murderers, and robbers in the forests.
2	4	3	As to this they say, 'Surely that--to wit, the forest (beast)--is not a beast (or cattle), and offering should not be made thereof: were he to make offering thereof, they would ere long carry away the Sacrificer dead to the woods, for forest (or wild) beasts have the forest for their share; and were he not to make offering thereof, it would be a violation of the sacrifice.' Well, they dismiss them after fire has been carried around them : thus, indeed, it isneither an offering nor a non-offering, and they do not carry the Sacrificer dead to the forest, and there is no violation of the sacrifice.
2	4	4	He completes (the sacrifice) with tame (beasts),--father and son part company , the roads run together, the village-boundaries of two villages become contiguous, and no ogres, man-tigers, thieves, murderers, and robbers come to be in the forests.
2	5	1	Pragâpati poured forth the life-sap of the horse (asva-medha); when poured forth it went from him. Having become fivefold  it entered the year, and they (the five parts) became those half-months . He followed it up by means of the fifteenfold (sets of victims ), and found it; and having found it, he took possession of it by means of the fifteenfold ones; for, indeed, they--to wit, the fifteenfold (sets)--are a symbol of the half-months, and when he seizes the fifteenfold ones, it is thehalf-months the Sacrificer thereby takes possession of.
2	5	2	Concerning this they say, 'But, surely, the year is not taken possession of by him who spreads out (performs sacrifice for) a year in any other way than by means of the Seasonal sacrifices .' The Seasonal sacrifices, doubtless, are manifestly the year; and when he seizes the Seasonal victims , he then manifestly takes possession of the year. ‘And, assuredly, he who spreads out the year in any other way than with the (victims) of the set of eleven  (stakes) is deprived of his offspring (orsubjects) and cattle, and fails to reach heaven. This set of eleven (stakes), indeed, is just heaven , and the set of eleven (stakes) means offspring (or people) and cattle and when he lays hands on the (victims) of the (two) sets of eleven (stakes) he does not fail to reach heaven, and is not deprived of his offspring and cattle.
2	5	3	Pragâpati created the Virâg; when created, it went away from him, and entered the horse meet for sacrifice. He followed it up with sets of ten  (beasts). He found it, and, having found it, he took possession of it by means of the sets of ten: when he seizes the sets of eleven (beasts), the Sacrificer thereby takes possession . of the Virâg. He seizes a hundred, for man has a life of a hundred (years) and a hundred energies: vital power and energy, vigour, he thus takes to himself.
2	5	4	Eleven decades  he seizes, for the Trishtubh consists of eleven syllables, and the Trishtubh means energy, vigour: thus it is for the obtainment of energy, vigour. Eleven decades he seizes, for in an animal there are ten vital airs, and the body: (trunk) is the eleventh: he thus supplies the animals with vital airs. They belong to all the gods for the completeness of the horse (sacrifice), for the horse belongs to all the gods. They are of many forms, whence beasts are of many forms; they are of distinct forms, whence beasts are of distinct forms.
2	6	1	, 'They harness the ruddy bay,moving (round the moveless: the lights shine in the heavens);'--the ruddy bay, doubtless, is yonder sun: it is yonder sun he harnesses for him, for the gaining of the heavenly world.
2	6	2	Concerning this they say, 'Surely, the sacrifice goes from him whose beast, when brought up, goes elsewhere than the vedi (altar-ground).'  'Singer of praise, make that horse come back to us by that path!'--the singer of praise, doubtless, is Vâyu (the wind) it is him he thereby places for him (the Sacrificer) on the other side, and so it does not go beyond that.
2	6	3	But, indeed, fiery mettle and energy, cattle, and prosperity depart from him who offers the Asvamedha.
2	6	4	With , 'May the Vasus anoint thee with the Gâyatra metre!' the queen consort anoints (the forepart of the unharnessed horse);--ghee is fiery mettle, and the Gâyatrî also is fiery mettle: two kinds of fiery mettle he thus bestows together on him (the Sacrificer).
2	6	5	With, 'May the Rudras anoint thee with the Traishtubha metre!' the (king's) favourite wife anoints (the middle part):--ghee is fiery mettle, and the Trishtubh is energy: both fierymettle and energy he thus bestows together on him.
2	6	6	With, 'May the Âdityas anoint thee with the Gâgata metre!' a discarded wife  (of the king) anoints (the hindpart);--ghee is fiery mettle, and the Gagatî is cattle: both fiery mettle and cattle he thus bestows together on him.
2	6	7	It is the wives  that anoint (the horse), for they to wit, (many) wives--are a form of prosperity (or social eminence): it is thus prosperity he confers on him (the Sacrificer), and neither fiery spirit, nor energy, nor cattle, nor prosperity pass away from him.
2	6	8	But even as some of the offering-material may get spilled before it is offered, so (part of) the victim is here spilled in that the hair of it when wetted comes off. When they (the wives) weave pearls (into the mane and tail) they gather up its hair. They are made of gold: the significance of this has been explained. A hundred and one pearls they weave into (the hair of) each part ; for man has a life of a hundred (years), and his own self (or body) is the one hundred and first: in vital power, in the self, he establishes himself. They weave them in (each) with (one of) the (sacred utterings) relating to Pragâpati, 'Bûh! bhuvah! svar (earth, air,heaven)!' for the horse is sacred to Pragâpati: with its own deity he thus supplies it. With, 'Parched grain, or parched groats?--in grain-food and in food from the cow'--he takes down the remaining food  (from the cart) for the horse: he thereby makes the (king's) people eaters of food (prosperous);--'eat ye, gods, this food! eat thou, Pragâpati, this food!' he thereby supplies the people with food.
2	6	9	Verily, fiery spirit and spiritual lustre pass away from him who performs the Asvamedha. The Hotri and the Brahman engage in a Brahmodya  (theological discussion); for the Hotri relates to Agni, and the Brahman (priest) to Brihaspati, Brihaspati being the Brahman (n.): fiery spirit  and spiritual lustre he thus bestows together on him. With the (central) sacrificial stake between them, they discourse together; for the stake is the Sacrificer : he thus encompasses the Sacrificer on both sides with fiery spirit and spiritual lustre.
2	6	10	'Who is it that walketh singly?'--it is yonder sun, doubtless, that walks singly , and he is spirituallustre: spiritual lustre the two (priests) thus bestow on him.
2	6	11	'Who is it that is born again?'--it is the moon, doubtless, that is born again (and -again): vitality they thus bestow on him.
2	6	12	'What is the remedy for cold?'--the remedy for cold, doubtless, is Agni '(fire): fiery spirit they thus bestow on him.
2	6	13	'And what is the great vessel?'--the great vessel, doubtless, is this (terrestrial) world: on this earth he thus establishes himself.
2	6	14	'What was the first conception?'--the first conception, doubtless, was the sky, rain: the sky, rain, he thus secures for himself.
2	6	15	'Who was the great bird ?'--the great bird, doubtless, was the horse:. vital power he thus secures for himself.
2	6	16	'Who was the smooth one?'--the smooth one (pilippilâ), doubtless, was beauty (srî ): beauty he thus secures for himself.
2	6	17	'Who was the tawny one?'--the two tawny ones, doubtless, are the day and the night : in the day and night he thus establishes himself.
2	7	1	When the victims have been bound (to the stakes), the Adhvaryu takes the sprinkling-water in order to sprinkle the horse. Whilst the Sacrificer holds on to him behind, he (in sprinkling the horse) runs rapidly through the formula used at the Soma-sacrifice , and then commences the one for the Asvamedha.
2	7	2	'May Vâyu favour thee with cooked kinds of food ,'--Vâyu (the wind) indeed cooks it ;--'the dark-necked one with he-goats,'--the dark-necked one, doubtless,is Agni (the fire); and the fire indeed cooks it (the horse) together with the he-goats.
2	7	3	'The Nyagrodha with cups,'--for when the gods were performing sacrifice, they tilted over those Soma-cups, and, turned downwards, they took root, whence the Nyagrodhas (ficus indica), when turned downwards (nyak), take root (roha ).
2	7	4	'The cotton-tree with growth,'--he confers growth on the cotton-tree (salmalia malabarica), whence the cotton-tree grows largest amongst trees .
2	7	5	'This male, fit for the chariot,'--he supplies the chariot with a horse, whence the horse draws nothing else than a chariot.
2	7	6	'Hath come hither on his four feet,'--therefore the horse, when standing, stands on three feet, but, when harnessed, it pulls with all its feet at one and the same time.
2	7	7	'May the spotless Brahman protect us!'--the spotless  Brahman (m.), doubtless, is the moon:to the moon he thus commits it;--'Reverence to Agni!'--to Agni he thus makes reverence.
2	7	8	'Trimmed up is the car with the cord,'--with cord one indeed completes the car , whence a car, when enveloped (with cords ), is very handsome.
2	7	9	'Trimmed up is the steed with the rein,'--with the rein one indeed completes the horse, whence the horse, when curbed by the rein, looks most beautiful.
2	7	10	'Trimmed up in the waters was the water-born,'--the horse, indeed, has sprung from the womb of the waters : with its own (mother's) womb he thus supplies it;--'Brahman (m.), with Soma for his leader,'--he thus makes it go to heaven with Soma for its leader.
2	7	11	'Thou shalt not die here, neither suffer harm,'--he thereby cheers it;--'on easy paths thou goest to the gods,'--he thereby shows him the paths leading to the gods;--'where dwell the pious, whither they have gone,'--he thereby makes it one who shares the same world with the pious;--'thither the god Savitri shall lead thee,'--it is, indeed, Savitri that leads him to the heavenly world.--Whilst whispering  'I sprinkle thee, acceptable unto Pragâpati,' he then holds (the sprinkling water) under (its mouth).
2	7	13	'Agni was an animal; they sacrificed him, and he gained that world wherein Agni (ruleth): that shall be thy world, that thou shalt gain,--drink thou this water!'--'As great as Agni's conquest was, as great as is his world, as great as is his lordship, so great shall be thy conquest, so great thy world, so great thy lordship,' this is what he thereby says to him.
2	7	14	'Vâyu was an animal; they sacrificed him, and he gained that world wherein. Vâyu (ruleth): that shall be thy world, that thou shalt gain,--drink thou this water!'--'As great as Vâyu's conquest was, as great as is his world, as great as is his lordship, so great shall be thy conquest, so great thy world, so great thy lordship,' this is what he thereby says to him.
2	7	15	'Sûrya was an animal; they sacrificed him, and he gained that world wherein Sûrya (ruleth): that shall be thy world, that thou shalt gain,--drink thou this water!'--'As great as Sûrya's conquest was, as great as is his world, as great as is his lordship, so great shall be thy conquest, so great thy world, so great thy lordship,' this is what he thereby says to him. Having satisfied the horse, and consecrated again the sprinkling water, he sprinkles the other victims: thereof hereafter.
2	8	1	Now the gods, when going upwards, did not know (the way to) the heavenly world, but the horse knew it: when they go upwards with the horse, it is in order to know (the way to) the heavenly world. 'A cloth, an upper cloth, and gold,' this  is what they spread out for the horse :thereon they quiet (slay) it, as (is done) for no other victim; and thus they separate it from the other victims.
2	8	2	When they quiet a victim they kill it. Whilst it is being quieted, he (the Adhvaryu) offers (three) oblations , with , 'To the breath hail! to the off-breathing hail! to the through-breathing hail!' he thereby lays the vital airs into it, and thus offering is made by him with this victim as a living one .
2	8	3	With, 'Ambâ! Ambikâ! Ambâlikâ ! there is no one to lead me,'--he leads up the (four)wives : he thereby has called upon them (to come), and, indeed, also renders them sacrificially pure.
2	8	4	With , 'We call upon thee, the host-leader of (divine) hosts, O my true lord!' the wives walk round (the horse), and thus make amends to it for that (slaughtering ): even thereby they (already) make amends to it; but,indeed, they also fan  it. Thrice they walk round ; for three (in number) are these worlds: by means of these worlds they fan it. Thrice again they walk round ,--that amounts to six, for there are six seasons: by means of the seasons they fan it.
2	8	5	But, indeed, the vital airs depart from those who perform the fanning at the sacrifice. Nine times they walk round ; for there are nine vital airs: vital airs they thus put into their own selves, and the vital airs do not depart from them. 'I will urge the seed-layer, urge thou the seed-layer!' (the Mahishî says );--seed, doubtless, means offspring and cattle: offspring and cattle she thus secures for herself.  'Let us stretch our feet,' thus in order to secure union. 'In heaven ye envelop yourselves' (the Adhvaryu says),--for that is, indeed, heaven where they immolate the victim: therefore hespeaks thus.--'May the vigorous male, the layer of seed, lay seed!' she says in order to secure union.
2	9	1	But, indeed, that glory, royal power, passes away from him who performs the Asvamedha.
2	9	2	'Raise her upwards ,'--the Asvamedha, doubtless, is that glory, royal power: that glory, royal power, he thus raises for him (the Sacrificer) upward.
2	9	3	'Even as one taking a burden up a mountain,'--glory (pomp), doubtless, is the burden of royal power: that glory, royal power, he thus fastens on him (as a burden); but he also endows him with that glory, royal power.
2	9	4	'And may the centre of her body prosper,'--the centre of royal power, doubtless, is glory: glory (prosperity), food, he thus lays into the very centre of royal power (or, the kingdom).
2	9	5	'As one winnowing in the cool breeze,'--the cool of royal power, doubtless, is security ofpossession: security of possession he procures for him.
2	9	6	'That little bird,'--the little bird, doubtless, is the people (or clan),--'which bustles with (the sound) "ahalak,"'--for the people, indeed, bustle for (the behoof of) royal power,--'thrusts the "pasas" into the cleft, and the "dhârakâ" devours it,'--the cleft, doubtless, is the people, and the 'pasas' is royal power; and royal power, indeed, presses hard on the people; whence the wielder of royal power is apt to strike down people.
2	9	7	'Thy mother and father,'--the mother, doubtless, is this (earth), and the father yonder (sky): by means of these two he causes him to go to heaven;--'mount to the top of the tree,'--the top of royal power, doubtless, is glory: the top of royal power, glory, he thus causes him to attain;--'saying, "I pass along," thy father passed his fist to and fro in the cleft,'--the cleft, doubtless, is the people; and the fist is royal power; and royal power, indeed, presses hard on the people; whence he who wields royal power is apt to strike down people .
2	9	8	'When the deer eats the corn,'--the grain (growing in the field), doubtless, is the people, and the deer is royal power: hethus makes the people to be food for the royal power, whence the wielder of royal power feeds on the people;--'it thinks not of the fat cattle,'--whence the king does not rear cattle;--'when the Sûdra woman is the Arya's mistress, he seeks not riches that he may thrive ,'--hence he does not anoint the son of a Vaisya woman.
2	9	9	But, indeed, the vital airs pass from those who speak impure speech at the sacrifice.  'The praises of Dadhikrâvan have I sung, (the victorious, powerful horse: may he make fragrant our mouths, and prolong our lives!),'--thus they finally utter a verse containing the word 'fragrant': it is (their own) speech they purify , and the vital airs do not pass from them.
2	10	1	When they prepare the knife-paths, the Sacrificer makes for himself that passage across, a bridge, for the attainment of the heavenly world.
2	10	2	They prepare them by means of needles; the needles, doubtless, are the people  (clans), and the Asvamedha is the royal power: they thus supply him with people and royal power combined. They are made of gold: the meaning of this has been explained.
2	10	3	Three kinds of needles are (used), copper ones, silver ones, and gold ones;--those of copper, doubtless, are the (principal) regions (of the compass), those of silver the intermediate ones, and those of gold the upper ones: it is by means of these (regions) they render it fit and proper. By way of horizontal and vertical (stitches ) they are many-formed, whence the regions are many-formed; and they are of distinct form, whence the regions are of distinct form.
2	11	1	Pragâpati desired, 'Would that I were great, and more numerous!' He perceived those two Mahiman (greatness) cups of Soma at the Asvamedha; he offered them; and thereby, indeed, became great and more numerous: hence whosoever should desire to become great, and more numerous, let him offer up those two Mahiman cups of Soma at the Asvamedha; and he indeed becomes great and more numerous.
2	11	2	He offers them on both sides (before and after) the omentum;--the Asvamedha, doubtless, is the Sacrificer, and that Mahiman (cup) is the king: it is with royal dignity he thus encompasses him on both sides. Some gods have the svâhâ-call ('hail') in front, and the other gods have the svâhâ-call behind : it is them he thus gratifies. With 'Hailto the gods!' and 'To the gods hail!' he makes offering by means of the king (Soma) on both sides of the omentum: he thereby gratifies those gods who are in this world, and those who are in the other, and thus gratified, both these kinds of gods lead him to the heavenly world.
3	1	1	Pragâpati's eye swelled; it fell out: thence the horse was produced; and inasmuch as it swelled (asvayat), that is the origin and nature of the horse (asva). By means of the Asvamedha the gods restored it to its place; and verily he who performs the Asvamedha makes Pragâpati complete, and he (himself) becomes complete; and this, indeed, is the atonement for everything, the remedy for everything. Thereby the gods redeem all sin, yea, even the slaying of a Brahman  they thereby redeem; and he who performs the Asvamedha redeems all sin, he redeems the slaying of a Brahman.
3	1	2	It was the left eye of Pragâpati that swelled: hence they cut off the (meat) portions from the left.side of the horse, and from the right side of other victims.
3	1	3	There is a rattan mat, for the horse was produced from the womb of the waters, and the rattan springs from the water: he thus brings it in connection with its own (maternal) womb.
3	1	4	The Katushtoma  is the form of chanting (onthe first day); for a bee tore out  (a piece of) the horse's thigh, and by means of the Katushtoma form of chanting the gods restored it: thus when there is the Katushtoma mode of chanting, it is for the completeness of the horse. The last day is an Atirâtra with all the Stomas --with a view to his obtaining and securing everything, for an Atirâtra with all the Stomas is everything, and the Asvamedha is everything.
3	2	1	Now this (Sacrificer), having- conquered by means of the supreme Stoma--the Katushtoma, the Krita among dice ,--on the next day establisheshimself on the Ekavimsa , as a firm foundation: from the Ekavimsa, as a firm foundation, he subsequently ascends to the next day, the seasons; for the Prishtha (-stotras) are the seasons, and the seasons are the year: it is in the seasons, in the year, he establishes himself.
3	2	2	The Sakvarî  (verses) are the Prishtha (-stotra of the second day): there is a different metre for each (verse), for different kinds of animals, both domestic and wild ones, are immolated here on each (day). As to the Sakvarî (verses) being the Prishtha, it is for the completeness of the horse (sacrifice) ; and different kinds of animals are immolated on different (days), because different stomas are performed on the different (days of the Asvamedha).
3	2	3	As to this they say, 'These--to wit, goats and sheep and the wild (beasts)--are not all animals ; but those--to wit, the bovine (victims)--are indeed all animals.' On the last day he immolates bovine (victims), for they--to wit, bovine (victims)--are all animals: he thus immolates all animals. They are sacred to the All-gods , for the completeness of the horse, for the horse is sacred to the All-gods. They are many-formed (or, many-coloured), whence animals are many-formed; and they are of distinct forms (or colours), whence animals are of distinct forms.
3	3	1	Inasmuch as there are three Anushtubh verses  (on the first day), therefore the horse, when standing, stands on three (feet); and inasmuch as (they are made into) four Gâyatrî verses, therefore the horse, when stepping out, scampers off on all (four) feet. For that Anushtubh, doubtless, is the highest metre, and the horse is the highest of animals; and the Katushtoma is the highest of Stomas: by means of what is highest he thus causes him (the Sacrificer) to reach the highest position.
3	3	2	The Sakvarî verses are the (Hotri's) Prishtha (of the second day): there is a different metre foreach (verse), for different Stomas are performed on each (day). And as to the Sakvarî verse being the Prishtha (-stotra), it is for the completeness of the horse (sacrifice).
3	3	3	The central day is an Ekavimsa one, for the Ekavimsa is yonder sun, and so is the Asvamedha by means of its own Stoma he thus establishes it in its own deity.
3	3	4	The Vâmadevya is the Maitrâvaruna's Sâman ; for the Vâmadevya is Pragâpati, and the horse is of Pragâpati's nature: he thus supplies it with its own deity.
3	3	5	The Pârthurasma is the Brahma-sâman ; for the horse is restrained by means of reins  (rasmi), but when unrestrained, unchecked, and unsteadied, it would be liable to go to the furthest distance: thus when the Pârthurasma is the Brahma-sâman, it is for the safe keeping of the horse.
3	3	6	The Samkriti  is the Akhâvâka's Sâman;--that Asvamedha, indeed, is, as it were, a disused sacrifice, for what is performed thereof, and what is not ? When the Samkriti is the Akhâvâka's Sâman, it is for (bringing about) the completeness of the horse (sacrifice). The last day is an Atirâtra with all the (six) Stomas, in order to his (the Sacrificer's) obtaining everything, for an Atirâtra with all the Stomas is everything, and the Asvamedha is everything.
3	3	7	The fire-altar is the twenty-one-fold one , the Stoma the twenty-one-fold one, and there are twenty-one sacrificial stakes; even as bulls or stallions  would clash together, so do these Stomas , thetwenty-one-versed, run counter to one another: were he to bring them together, the Sacrificer would suffer harm, and his sacrifice would be destroyed.
3	3	8	There may, indeed, be a twelvefold altar, and eleven stakes. When the altar is a twelvefold one--twelve months being a year--it is the year, the sacrifice, he obtains. When there are eleven stakes, then that Virâg (metre), the Ekâdasinî , is contrived; and that which is its eleventh (stake) is its teat: thereby he milks it.
3	3	9	As to this they say, 'If there were a twelvefold altar, and eleven stakes, it would be as if one were to drive on a cart drawn by one beast.' There are the twenty-one-fold altar, the twenty-one-fold Stoma, and twenty-one stakes: that is as when one drives with side-horses.
3	3	10	That twenty-one-fold one, indeed, is the head of the sacrifice; and, verily, he who knows three heads on the Asvamedha, becomes the head of kings. There are the twenty-one-fold altar, the twenty-one-fold Stoma, and twenty-one stakes: these are the three heads on the Asvamedha; and, verily, he who thus knows them becomes the head of kings. And, indeed, he who knows the three tops on the Asvamedha, becomes the top of kings;--there are the twenty-one-fold altar, the twenty-one-fold Stoma, and twenty-one stakes: these, indeed, are the three tops on the Asvamedha; and, verily, he who thus knows them becomes the top of kings.
3	4	1	Verily, the horse is slaughtered for all the deities: were he to make it one belonging to Pragâpati (exclusively), he would deprive the deities who are co-sharers of their share. Having made ghee (to take the part of) portions (of the horse's body) he makes oblations  to the deities in mentioning them one by one with , 'The Grass (I gratify) with the teeth, the Lotus with the roots of the hair, . . . :' the deities who are co-sharers he thus supplies with their share. When he has offered the Aranyenûkya (oblations) , he offers the last oblation to Heaven and Earth; for all the gods are established in heaven and on earth: it is them he thereby gratifies. Now the gods and the Asuras were contending together.
3	4	2	They (the gods) spake, 'We are the Agnayah Svishtakritah  of the horse (sacrifice); let us take out for ourselves a special share: therewith we shall overcome the Asuras.' They took the blood for themselves in order to overcome their rivals; when he offers the blood to the Svishtakrits, it is in order to overcome (his own) rivals; and the spiteful rival of him who knows this is undone by himself.
3	4	3	The first oblation (of blood) he offers  in thethroat (gullet) of the Gomriga ; for Gomrigas are cattle, and the Svishtakrit is Rudra: he thusshields the cattle from Rudra, whence Rudra does not prowl after the cattle where this oblation is offered at the Asvamedha.
3	4	4	The second oblation  he offers on a horse-hoof; for the one-hoofed (animals) are cattle, and the Svishtakrit is Rudra: he thus shields the cattle from Rudra, whence Rudra does not prowl after the cattle where this oblation is offered at the Asvamedha.
3	4	5	The third oblation he offers in an iron bowl; for the people (subjects) are of iron , and the Svishtakrit is Rudra: he thus shields the people from Rudra, whence Rudra does not prowl after the cattle where this oblation is offered at the Asvamedha.
3	5	1	Verily, there are deaths  connected with all the worlds; and were he not to offer oblations to them, Death would get hold of him in every world:when he offers oblations to the Deaths , he wards off Death in every world.
3	5	2	Concerning this they say, 'If, in offering, he were to name them all, saying, "To such  (a death) hail! To such (a death) hail!" he would make that manifold death his enemy , and would give himself over to Death.' Only one oblation he offers to one of them, with, 'To Death, hail!' for there is indeed but one Death in yonder world, even Hunger : it is him he wards off in yonder world.
3	5	3	A second oblation he makes with, 'To Brahman-slaying, hail!' for, doubtless, a murder other than the slaying of a Brahman is no murder; but that--to wit, the slaying of a Brahman--is manifestly murder: he thus manifestly wards off Death .
3	5	4	Mundibha Audanya  it was who discovered this atonement for the slaying of a Brahman; and when one offers the oblation to the Brahmahatyâ he prepares a remedy for the slayer of a Brahman by satisfying Death himself with an oblation, and making a protection  for him (the slayer). At whosoever's Asvamedha, therefore, this oblation is offered, even if in after-times  any one in his family kills a Brahman, he thereby prepares a remedy (expiation) for him.
3	6	1	When the horse was slaughtered, the life-sap  went out of it; it became the Asvastomîya (set of oblations ): when he offers the Asvastomîya (oblations) he indeed supplies the horse with life-sap.
3	6	2	He performs it with ghee; for ghee is life-sap, and the Asvastomîya is life-sap: by means of life-saphe thus puts life-sap into it. He performs with ghee, for that--to wit, ghee--is the favourite resource of the gods: he thus supplies them with their favourite resource.
3	6	3	Having performed the Asvastomîya (set of) oblations, he offers the Dvipadâs ; for the Asvastomîya is the horse, and the Dvipadâ is man, for man is two-footed (dvipâd), supported on two (feet): he thus supplies him with a support.
3	6	4	Concerning this they say, 'Is the Asvastomîya to be offered first, or the Dvipadâ?' The Asvastomîya, surely, is cattle, and the Dvipadâ is man: inasmuch as he performs the Dvipadâs after performing the Asvastomîya, man subsequently establishes himself amongst cattle.
3	6	5	Sixteen Asvastomîya oblations he performs, for animals (cattle) consist of sixteen parts : that is the measure of cattle, and he thus supplies cattle with their (right) measure; Were he to offer either less or more, he would deprive cattle of their (right) measure. Sixteen he offers, for cattle consist of sixteen parts: that is the measure of cattle, and he thus supplies cattle with their (right) measure. He offers no other as a final oblation : were he to offer another as a final oblation, he would losehis support. The Dvipadâs he offers last, for Dvipadâs are a support: he thus finds a support (establishes himself). With, 'To Gumbaka hail!' he offers, at the purificatory bath, the last oblation ; for Gumbaka is Varuna: by sacrifice he thus manifestly redeems himself from Varuna. He offers it on the head of a white-spotted , baldheaded (man) with protruding teeth  and reddish brown eyes; for that is Varuna's form: by (that) form (of his) he thus redeems himself from Varuna.
3	6	6	Having stepped out (of the water) he prepares twelve messes of cooked rice for the priests, or performs twelve ishtis. Concerning this they say, 'These to wit, ishtis--are a form of sacrifice: were he to perform ishtis, the sacrifice would be ready to incline towards him; but he would become the worse for it, for, surely, of exhausted strength now are the metres (offering formulas) of him who has performed the Soma-sacrifice;--how could he make use of them so soon? For when the sacrifice is complete, Vâk (speech and sacred writ ) is wholly gained, and, being gained, it now is exhausted in strength, and, as it were, wounded and mangled; but sacrifice is speech: hence he should not make use of it.'
3	6	7	Having stepped out (of the water) he should certainly prepare twelve messes of rice for the priests; for cooked rice is Pragâpati, and Pragâpati is the year, Pragâpati is the sacrifice: it is the year, the sacrifice, he thus gains, and the sacrifice becomes ready to incline towards him, and he does not become the worse for it.
3	7	1	Verily, this is the sacrifice called Strengthful: wherever they worship with this sacrifice, everything indeed becomes strong.
3	7	2	Verily, this is the sacrifice called Plenteous: wherever they worship with this sacrifice, everything indeed becomes plentiful.
3	7	3	Verily, this is the sacrifice called Obtainment: wherever they worship with this sacrifice, everything indeed becomes obtained.
3	7	4	Verily, this is the sacrifice called Distinction: wherever they worship with this sacrifice, everything indeed becomes distinct .
3	7	5	Verily, this is the sacrifice called Severance: wherever they worship with this sacrifice, everything indeed becomes severed .
3	7	6	Verily, this is the sacrifice called Food-abounding: wherever they worship with this sacrifice, everything indeed becomes abounding in food.
3	7	7	Verily, this is the sacrifice called Sapful:wherever they worship with this sacrifice, everything indeed becomes rich in sap (or drink).
3	7	8	Verily, this is the sacrifice called Abounding in holiness: wherever they worship with this sacrifice, the Brâhmana is born as one rich in holiness.
3	7	9	Verily, this is the sacrifice called Excelling in hitting: wherever they worship with this sacrifice, the Râganya is born as one excelling in hitting (the mark).
3	7	10	Verily, this is the sacrifice called the Long (wide) one: wherever they worship with this sacrifice, a wide tract of forest-land will be provided .
3	7	11	Verily, this is the sacrifice called Fitness: wherever they worship with this sacrifice, everything indeed becomes fit and proper.
3	7	12	Verily, this is the sacrifice called Support (foundation): wherever they worship with this sacrifice, everything indeed becomes supported (firmly established).
3	8	1	Now, then, of the expiations. If the sacrificial horse were to couple with a mare, let him in addition prepare a milk (oblation) to Vâyu;--Vâyu doubtless is the transformer of seeds, for Vâyu (the wind) is the vital air, and the vital air is the transformerof seeds: by means of seed he thus puts seed into it.
3	8	2	And if disease were to befal it, let him in addition prepare a pap to Pûshan, for Pûshan rules over beasts (cattle); and, indeed, he thereby gratifies him who owns cattle and rules over cattle; and it (the horse) thereby indeed becomes free from disease.
3	8	3	And if sickness without (visible) injury  were to befal it, let him in addition prepare for (Agni) Vaisvânara a cake on twelve potsherds, with the earth serving for potsherds ; for Vaisvânara is this (earth): he thereby gratifies this (earth), and it (the horse) becomes free from disease.
3	8	4	And if an eye-disease were to befal it, let him in addition prepare a pap to Sûrya;--the Sun, doubtless, is the eye of creatures, for when he rises everything here moves: by means of the eye (of the world) he thus bestows the eye upon it. And as to why it is a pap (karu), it is because by means of the eye this self (body or mind) moves (kar).
3	8	5	And if it were to die in water, let him in addition prepare a barley pap to Varuna, for Varuna seizes him who dies in water: he thereby thus gratifies that very deity who seizes it, and, thus gratified, he approves his slaughtering another (horse), and he slaughters it as one approved by that (deity). And as to why it is (prepared) of barley, it is because barley belongs to Varuna.
3	8	6	And if it were to get lost, let him in additionperform an ishti with three sacrificial dishes--a cake on one potsherd for Heaven and Earth, a milk (oblation) for Vâyu, and a pap for Sûrya;--for whatsoever is lost, is lost within heaven and earth; and the wind blows upon it, and the sun shines upon it; and nothing whatever is lost out of (the reach of) these deities. And even by itself  this (ishti) is the recoverer of what is lost; and even if any other thing of his were to get lost let him perform this very offering, and he verily finds it. And if enemies were to obtain the horse, or if it were to die (either in any other way) or in water , let them bring another (horse) and consecrate it by sprinkling: this, indeed, is the expiation in that case.
4	1	1	Pragâpati desired, 'Would that I obtained all my desires! would that I attained all attainments!' He beheld this three days’ Soma-sacrifice, the Asvamedha, and took possession of it, and sacrificed with it: by sacrificing therewith he obtained all his desires, and attained all attainments; and, verily, whosoever performs the Asvamedha sacrifice obtains all his desires, and attains all attainments.
4	1	2	Concerning this they say, 'In what season is the beginning (to be made)?'--'Let him begin it in summer,' say some, 'for summer is the Kshatriya's season, and truly this--to wit, the Asvamedha--is the Kshatriya's sacrifice.'
4	1	3	But let him rather begin it in spring; forspring is the Brâhmana's season, and truly whosoever sacrifices, sacrifices after becoming, as it were, a Brâhmana: let him therefore by all means begin it in spring.
4	1	4	And six days, or seven days, before that full-moon of Phâlguna, the officiating priests meet together--to wit, the Adhvaryu, the Hotri, the Brahman, and the Udgâtri; for under these  the other priests are.
4	1	5	The Adhvaryu prepares for them a priest's mess of rice sufficient for four persons: the meaning of this has been explained . Four bowlfuls, four double handfuls, four handfuls: twelvefold this is--twelve months are a year, and the year is everything, and the Asvamedha is everything--thus it is in order to his gaining and securing everything.
4	1	6	Those four priests eat it: the meaning of this has been explained. He (the Sacrificer) gives to them four thousand (cows) in order to his gaining and securing everything, for a thousand means everything, and the Asvamedha is everything. And (he gives them) four gold plates weighing a hundred (grains): the meaning of this has been explained .
4	1	7	The Adhvaryu then, hanging a gold ornament (nishka) round him, makes him mutter , 'Fire thou art, light and immortality,'--for gold, indeed, is fire, light , andimmortality: fire (fiery mettle), light (brilliance), and immortality he thus bestows upon him;--'protector of life, protect my life!' he thereby bestows life (vital strength) upon him. With a view to commencing the sacrifice, he then says to him, 'Restrain thy speech!' for the sacrifice is speech.
4	1	8	Four (of the king's) wives are in attendance--the consecrated queen, the favourite wife, a discarded wife, and the Pâlâgalî , all of them adorned and wearing gold ornaments (neck-plates)--with the view of the completeness of conjugal union. With them he enters the hall of the sacrificial fires--the Sacrificer by the eastern, the wives by the southern, door.
4	1	9	When the evening-offering  has been performed, he lies down with his favourite wife behind the Gârhapatya hearth, with his head towards the north. At the same place  the other (wives) also lie down. He lies in her lap without embracing her , thinking, 'May I, by this self-restraint, reach successfully the end of the year!'
4	1	10	When the morning offering has been performed, the Adhvaryu performs a full-offering  with a view to his (the Sacrificer's) gaining and securing everything, for the full means everything, and the Asvamedha is everything. At this (offering) he releases speech by (bestowing) a boon,saying, 'I grant a boon to the Brahman (priest):' (this he does) with a view to his gaining and securing everything, for a boon is everything, and the Asvamedha is everything.
4	1	11	The gold ornament which is attached to his (neck) he then gives to the Adhvaryu: in giving it to the Adhvaryu he secures to himself immortal life, for gold means immortal life.
4	1	12	For the object of (gaining) the road, and in order not to lose the mouth (mukha) of the sacrifice, he then prepares an ishti-offering  to Agni. For, indeed, all the deities have Agni for their mouth, and in the Asvamedha are (contained) all objects of desire: 'Having, at the outset (mukhatah), gratified all the gods, may I obtain all my desires!' so he thinks.
4	1	13	For this (offering) there are fifteen kindling-verses ; for fifteenfold is the thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt means vigour: with the thunderbolt (of) vigour the Sacrificer thus from the first repels evil. The two butter-portions relate to the slaying of Vritra , with a view to the repelling of evil, for Vritra is evil.  'Agni, the head, the summit of the sky . . . ,' and 'Be thou the leader of the sacrifice and the realm of space (whither thou strivest with auspicious teams: thy light-winning head hast thou raised to the sky, and thy tongue, O Agni, hast thou made the bearer of the offering),' pronounced in a low voice, are the anuvâkyâ and yâgyâ of the chief oblation. The one contains (the word) head,' the other (the verb) 'to be,'--for the head, assuredly, is he that shines yonder: thus it is in order to secure him (the Sun); and as to why (the other) contains (the verb) 'to be,'--he thereby secures that which is (the real, truly existent). The Samyâgyâs  are two virâg-verses ; for that--to wit, the Virâg--is the metrebelonging to all the gods, and all objects of desire are (contained) in the Asvamedha: 'Having gratified all the gods, may I obtain all my desires!' so he thinks. The sacrificial fee is gold weighing a hundred (grains): the meaning of this has been explained.
4	1	14	He then prepares a (pap) for Pûshan, for Pûshan is the overlord of roads: he thus secures successful progress to the horse. But Pûshan is also this (earth): he thus makes this (earth) its guardian, for neither injury nor failure befals him whom this (earth) guards on the way; and this (earth) he thus makes its guardian.
4	1	15	For this (offering) there are seventeen kindling-verses , for the obtainment of the Asvamedha, for Pragâpati is seventeenfold, and the Asvamedha is Pragâpati. The two butter-portions are possessed of 'growth ,' even for the growth of the Sacrificer.  'Pûshan, in thy sway we ,' and 'The hymn (?) lovingly composed by desire of praise hath reachedthe guardian of every path: (may he, Pûshan, grant unto us draughts of light (?), and fulfil our every prayer!'), pronounced in a low voice, are the anuvâkyâ and yâgyâ of the chief oblation. The one contains (the word) 'sway,' the other (the word) 'path'; for sway is vigour: (thus it is) in order to his gaining and securing vigour; and as to why (the other) contains (the word) 'path,' he thereby secures successful progress to the horse. The invitatory and offering formulas of the Svishtakrit are two anushtubh verses ; for the Anushtubh is speech, and Pragâpati is speech, and the Asvamedha is Pragâpati: thus it is for the obtainment of the Asvamedha. The priests’ fee consists of a hundred garments, for that--to wit, the garment--is man's outward appearance, whence people (on seeing) Any well-clad man, ask, 'Who can this be? for he is perfect in his outward appearance: with outward appearance he thus endows him. There are a hundred of them, for man has a life of a hundred (years), and a hundred energies: life, and energy, vigour, he thus gains for himself.
4	2	1	Whilst this (offering to Pûshan) is being performed, the horse, having been cleansed, is led up--being one which is marked with all colours, or which is perfect in speed, worth a thousand (cows), in its prime, and without its match under the right-side yoke .
4	2	2	And as to its being one marked with all colours, it is for the sake of his (the Sacrificer's) obtaining and securing everything, for colour (outward appearance) is everything, and the Asvamedha is everything. And as to its being perfect in speed, it is for the sake of his obtaining and securing vigour, for speed is vigour. And as to its being worth a thousand (cows), it is for the sake of his obtaining and securing everything, for a thousand means everything, and the Asvamedha is everything. And as to its being in its prime, it is for the sake of his obtaining unlimited vigour, for such a one that is in the prime (of youth) increases to unlimited vigour. And as to its being without its match under the right-side yoke, it is for the sake of his obtaining yonder (sun), for that (horse) indeed is he that shines yonder, and assuredly there is no one to rival him.
4	2	3	As to this, Bhâllaveya, however, said, 'That horse should be of two colours, black-spotted , for that (horse) was produced from Pragâpati's eye, and this eye is of two colours, white and black: he thus endows it with its own colour.'
4	2	4	But Sâtyayagñi said, 'That horse should be of three colours, its forepart black, its hindpart white, with a wain for its mark in front;--when its forepart is black it is the same as this black of the eye; and when its hindpart is white it is the same as this white of the eye; and when it has a wain for its mark in front, that is the pupil: sucha one, indeed, is perfect in colour .' Whichever of these, then, should be ready at hand, either a many-coloured one, or one of two colours, or one of three colours with a wain for its mark, let him slaughter it: but in speed it should certainly be perfect.
4	2	5	In front (of the sacrificial ground) there are those keepers of it ready at hand,--to wit, a hundred royal princes, clad in armour; a hundred warriors armed with swords; a hundred sons of heralds and headmen, bearing quivers filled with arrows ; and a hundred sons of attendants  and charioteers, bearing staves;--and a hundred exhausted, worn out horses  amongst which, having let loose that (sacrificial horse), they guard it.
4	2	6	He then prepares an (ishti) offering to Savitri --a cake on twelve potsherds to Savitri Prasavitri--thinking, May Savitri impel this my sacrifice!' for Savitri (the sun), indeed, is the impeller (prasavitri).
4	2	7	For this (offering) there are fifteen kindling-verses;and the two butter-portions relate to the slaying of Vritra . , 'He who calleth forth all these beings (with his call, may he, Savitri, quicken us)!' and 'May the divine Savitri come hither, treasure-laden, (filling the air whilst driving with his steeds; holding in his hand many things meet for man; and laying to rest and awakening the world),' pronounced in a low voice, are the invitatory and offering formulas of the chief oblation. Those of the Svishtakrit are two virâg-verses . The priests’ fee is gold weighing a hundred (grains): the meaning of this has been explained.
4	2	8	Whilst the fore-offerings of this (ishti) are being performed, a Brâhman lute-player, striking up the uttaramandrâ (tune ), sings three strophes composed by himself (on topics  such as), 'Such a sacrifice he offered,--Such gifts he gave:' the meaning of this has been explained .
4	2	9	He then prepares a second (offering)--a cake on twelve potsherds to Savitri Âsavitri--thinking, 'May Savitri propel this my sacrifice!' for Savitri, indeed, is the propeller (âsavitri).
4	2	10	For this (offering) there are seventeen kindling-verses; and the two butter-portions are possessed of that which is : the (truly) existent he thereby obtains.  'The all-divine, true lord (we hope to gain this day by our hymns, Savitri of true impulsion),' and 'Indestructible is that (work) of the divine Savitri, (that he will ever sustain the whole world: whatever he, the fair-fingered, bringeth forth over the extent of the earth and the expanse of the sky, that is truly his own),' pronounced in a low voice, are the invitatory and offering formulas of the chief offering. Those of the Svishtakrit (he makes) the regular ones , thinking, 'Lest I should depart from the path of sacrifice:' he thus finally establishes himself in the well-ordered sacrifice. Trishtubh-verses they are for the sake of his gaining and securing (Indra's) energy, vigour, for the Trishtubh is the vigour in Indra. The priests’ fee is gold weighing a hundred (grains): the meaning of this has been explained .
4	2	14	Whilst the fore-offerings of this (ishti) arebeing performed, a Brâhman lute-player, striking up the uttaramandrâ (tune), sings three strophes composed by himself (on topics such as), 'Such a sacrifice he offered,--Such gifts he gave:' the meaning of this has been explained.
4	2	15	When this (offering) is completed, the Adhvaryu and the Sacrificer rise, and whisper in the horse's right ear , 'Plenteous by thy mother, strengthful by dry father . . .!' the meaning of this has been explained . They then set it free towards the north-east, for that--to wit, the north-east--is the region of both gods and men: they thus consign it to its own region, in order to its suffering no injury, for one who is established in his own home suffers no injury.
4	2	16	He says, 'O ye gods, guardians of the regions, guard ye this horse, consecrated for offering unto the gods!' The (four kinds of) human guardians of the (four) regions have been told, and these now are the divine ones, to wit, the Âpyas, Sâdhyas, Anvâdhyas  and Maruts; and both of these, gods and men, of one mind, guard it for a year without turning (driving) it back. The reason why they do not turn it back, is that it is he that shines yonder,--and who, forsooth, is able to turn him back? But were they to turn it back, everything here assuredly would go backward (go to ruin): therefore they guard it without turning it back.
4	2	17	He says, 'Ye guardians of the quarters, those who go on to the end of this (horse-sacrifice) willbecome (sharers of) the royal power, they will become kings worthy of being consecrated; but those who do not go on to the end of this (sacrifice) will be excluded from royal power, they will not become kings, but nobles and peasants, unworthy of being consecrated: do not ye therefore be heedless, and keep it (the horse) from water suitable for bathing and from mares! And whenever ye meet with any kind of Brâhmanas, ask ye them, "O Brâhmanas, how much know ye of the Asvamedha?" and those who know naught thereof ye may despoil; for the Asvamedha is everything, and he who, whilst being a Brâhmana, knows naught of the Asvamedha, knows naught of anything, he is not a Brâhmana, and as such liable to be despoiled. Ye shall give it drink, and throw down fodder for it; and whatever prepared food there is in the country all that shall be prepared for you. Your abode shall be in the house of a carpenter of these (sacrificers ), for there is the horse's resting-place.'
4	3	1	Having set free the horse, he (the Adhvaryu) spreads a cushion wrought of gold (threads) south of the Vedi: thereon the Hotri seats himself. On the right (south) of the Hotri, the Sacrificer on a gold stool ; on the right of him, the Brahmanand Udgâtri on cushions wrought of gold; in front of them, with his face to the west, the Adhvaryu on a gold stool, or a slab of gold.
4	3	2	When they are seated together, the Adhvaryu calls upon (the Hotri), saying, 'Hotri, recount the beings: raise thou this Sacrificer above the beings !' Thus called upon, the Hotri, being about to tell the Pâriplava  Legend, addresses (the Adhvaryu), 'Adhvaryu!'--'Havai  hotar!' replies the Adhvaryu.
4	3	3	'King Manu Vaivasvata,' he says;--'his people are Men, and they are staying here ;'--householders, unlearned in the scriptures, have come thither : it is these he instructs;--'The Rik (verses) are the Veda : this it is;' thus saying, let him go over a hymn of the Rik, as if reciting it . Masters of lute-players have comethither: these he calls upon, 'Masters of lute-players,' he says, 'sing ye of this Sacrificer along with righteous kings of yore !' and they accordingly sing of him; and in thus singing of him, they make him share the same world with the righteous kings of yore.
4	3	4	Having called (on the masters of lute-players), the Adhvaryu performs the Prakrama oblations , either on the southern fire, or on a footprint of the horse, after drawing lines round it--whichever is the practice there; but the former  is the established rule.
4	3	5	Prior to the (first) offering to Savitri he offers, once only, the (oblations relating to the) Forms  in the Âhavanîya fire, whilst going rapidly over (the formulas). And in the evening, whilst the Dhritis  (oblations for the safe keeping of the horse) are being offered, a Râganya lute-player, striking up the uttaramandrâ (tune) south (of the vedi), sings three stanzas composed by himself (on topics  such as), 'Such war he waged,--Such battle he won:' the meaning of this has been explained.
4	3	6	And on the morrow, the second day, after those (three) offerings to Savitri have been performed in the same way, there is that same courseof procedure. 'Adhvaryu!' he (the Hotri) says.--'Havai hotar!' replies the Adhvaryu.--'King Yama Vaivasvata ,' he (the Hotri) says, 'his people are the Fathers, and they are staying here;'--old men have come thither: it is these he instructs;--'The Yagus-formulas are the Veda: this it is;' thus saying, let him go over a chapter (anuvâka) of the Yagus , as if reciting it. The Adhvaryu calls in the same way (on the masters of lute-players), but does not perform the Prakrama oblations.
4	3	7	And on the third day, after those (three) offerings have been performed in the same way, there is that same course of procedure. 'Adhvaryu!' he (the Hotri) says.--'Havai hotar!' replies the Adhvaryu.--'King Varuna Âditya,' he says; 'his people are the Gandharvas, and they are staying here;'--handsome youths have come thither: it is these he instructs;--'The Atharvans are the Veda: this it is;' thus saying, let him go over one section (parvan) of the Atharvan , as if recitingit. The Adhvaryu calls in the same way (on the masters of lute-players), but does not perform the Prakrama oblations.
4	3	8	And on the fourth day, after those (three) offerings have been performed in the same way, there is the same course of procedure. 'Adhvaryu!' he (the Hotri) says.--'Havai hotar!' replies the Adhvaryu.--'King Soma Vaishnava ,' he says; 'his people are the Apsaras, and they are staying here;'--handsome maidens have come thither: it is these he instructs ;--'The Aṅgiras are the Veda: this it is;' thus saying, let him go over one section of the Aṅgiras , as if reciting it. The Adhvaryu calls in the same way (on the masters of lute-players), but does not perform the Prakrama oblations.
4	3	9	And on the fifth day, after those (three) offerings have been performed in the same way, there is the same course of procedure. 'Adhvaryu!' he (the Hotri) says.--'Havai hotar!' replies the Adhvaryu.--'King Arbuda Kâdraveya ,' he says; 'his people are the Snakes, and they are staying here;'--both snakes and snake-charmers  have come thither: it is these he instructs--'The Sarpavidyâ (science of snakes) is the Veda: this it is;' thus saying, let him go over one section of the Sarpavidyâ  as if reciting it. The Adhvaryu calls in the same way (on the masters of lute-players), but does not perform the Prakrama oblations.
4	3	10	And on the sixth day, after those (three) offerings have been performed in the same way, there is the same course of procedure. 'Adhvaryu!' he (the Hotri) says.--'Havai hotar!' replies the Adhvaryu.--'King Kubera Vaisravana,' he says; 'his people are the Rakshas, and they are staying here;'--evil-doers, robbers , have come thither: itis these he instructs;--'The Devaganavidyâ  (demonology) is the Veda: this it is;' thus saying, let him go over one section of the Devaganavidyâ, as if he were reciting it. The Adhvaryu calls in the same way (on the masters of lute-players), but does not perform the Prakrama oblations.
4	3	11	And on the seventh day, after those (three) offerings have been performed in the same way, there is the same course of procedure. 'Adhvaryu!' he (the Hotri) says.--'Havai hotar!' replies the Adhvaryu.--'King Asita Dhânva ,' he says; 'his people are the Asura; and they are staying here;'--usurers have come thither: it is these he instructs;--'Magic  is the Veda: this it is;' thus saying, let him perform some magic trick. The Adhvaryu calls in the same way (on the masters of lute-players), but does not perform the Prakrama oblations.
4	3	12	And on the eighth day, after those (three) offerings have been performed in the same way, there is the same course of procedure. 'Adhvaryu!' he (the Hotri) says.--'Havai hotar!' replies the Adhvaryu.--'King Matsya Sâmmada ,' he says; 'his people are the water-dwellers, and they are staying here;'--both fish and fishermen  have come thither: it is these he instructs;--'the Itihâsa  is the Veda: this it is;' thus saying, let him tell some Itihâsa. The Adhvaryu calls in the same way (on the masters of lute-players), but does not perform the Prakrama oblations.
4	3	13	And on the ninth day, after those (three) offerings have been performed in the same way, there is the same course of procedure. 'Adhvaryu!' he (the Hotri) says.--'Havai hotar!' replies the Adhvaryu.--'King Târkshya Vaipasyata ,' he says; 'his people are the Birds, and they are staying here;'--both birds and bird-catchers  have come thither: it is these he instructs;--'the Purâna  is the Veda: this it is;' thus saying, let him tell some Purâna . The Adhvaryu callsin the same way (on the masters of lute-players), but does not perform the Prakrama oblations.
4	3	14	And on the tenth day, after those (three) offerings have been performed in the same way, there is the same course of procedure. 'Adhvaryu!' he (the Hotri) says.--'Havai hotar!' replies the Adhvaryu.--'King Dharma Indra ,' he says, 'his people are the Gods, and they are staying here;'--learned srotriyas (theologians), accepting no gifts , have come thither: it is these he instructs; 'the Sâman (chant-texts) are the Veda: this it is;' thus saying, let him repeat  a decade of the Sâman. The Adhvaryu calls in the same way (on the masters of lute-players), but does not perform the Prakrama oblations.
4	3	15	this revolving (legend), he tells all royalties, all regions, all Vedas, all gods, all beings; and, verily, for whomsoever the Hotri, knowing this, tells this revolving legend, or whosoever even knows this, attains to fellowship and communion with these royalties, gains the sovereign rule and lordship over all people, secures for himself all the Vedas, and, by gratifying the gods, finally establishes himself on all beings. This very same legend revolves again and again for a year; and. inasmuch as it revolves again and again, thereforeit is (called) the revolving (legend). For thirty-six ten-days’ periods he tells it,--the Brihatî (metre) consists of thirty-six syllables, and cattle are related to the Brihatî metre: by means of the Brihatî he thus secures cattle for him.
4	4	1	When the year has expired , the Dîkshâ (initiation) takes place. After the slaughtering of the victim sacred to Pragâpati , the (ishti) offerings  come to an end. Some, however, say, ‘Let him offer (them) on the fires of his Purohita (court-chaplain). But why should one who is initiated make offering? There are twelve Dîkshâ (days), twelve Upasad (days) and three Sutyâs (Soma-days), that amounts to the thrice-ninefold (stoma); but the thrice-ninefold, indeed, is a thunderbolt, and the horse is the nobility (kshatra), and the Râganya is the nobility; and political power (kshatra) is won by the thunderbolt: thus he wins  political power by means of the thunderbolt.
4	4	2	When the Initiation-offering has been completed, and Speech released in the evening, mastersof lute-players have come thither: these the Adhvaryu calls upon, 'Masters of lute-players,' he says, 'sing ye of this Sacrificer along with the gods!' and they accordingly sing of him in that manner--
4	4	3	Day by day, after speech has been released, when, on the completion of the Agnîshomîya (animal sacrifices), the Vasatîvarî (water) has been carried round  (the sacrificial ground). The reason why they thus sing of him along with the gods is that they thereby make him share the same world with the gods.
4	4	4	On the Sutyâ-days (they sing of him) along with Pragâpati in the same way day by day, after the Vasatîvarî (water) has been carried round , and the Udavasânîyâ (offering) has been finally completed. The reason why they thus sing of himalong with Pragâpati is that they thereby finally make him share the same world with Pragâpati.
4	4	5	There are twenty-one sacrificial stakes, all of them twenty-one cubits long. The central one  is of raggudâla  wood; on both sides thereof stand two  pîtudâru (deodar) ones, six of bilva wood (Aegle Marmelos)--three on this side, and three on that,--six of khadira (Acacia Catechu) wood--three on this side, and three on that,--six of palâsa (Butea frondosa) wood--three on this side, and three on that.
4	4	6	Then as to why these stakes are suchlike. When Pragâpati's vital airs had gone out of him, his body began to swell; and what phlegm there was in it that flowed together and burst forth from inside through the nose, and it became this tree, the raggudâla, whence it is viscid, for it originated from phlegm: with that form (quality) he thus endows it (the stake). And as to why it is the (stake) standing by the fire, it is because that one is the centre of the stakes, and that nose is the centre of the (channels of the) vital airs: he thus puts it in its own place.
4	4	7	And what watery (liquid) fire, and what fragrance there was, that flowed together andburst forth from the eye, and became that tree, the pîtudâru; whence that (wood) is sweet-smelling, since it originated from fragrance, and whence it is inflammable, since it originated from fire: with that quality he thus endows it. And because these two (pîtudâru stakes) are on the two sides of the central one, therefore these two eyes are on the two sides of the nose: he thus puts those two in their own place.
4	4	8	And what 'kuntâpa ,' what marrow there was, that flowed together, and burst forth from the ear, and became that tree, the bilva; whence all the fruit of that (tree) is eatable  inside, and whence it (the tree, or wood) is yellowish, for marrow is yellowish: with that quality he thus endows it. The two (sets of) pîtudâru (stakes) stand inside, and the bilva ones outside, for the eyes are inside, and the ears outside: he thus puts them in their own place.
4	4	9	From his (Pragâpati's) bones the khadira, was produced, whence that (tree) is hard and of great strength , for hard, as it were, is bone: with that quality he thus endows it. The bilva (stakes) areinside, and the khadira ones outside, for inside is the marrow, and outside the bones: he thus puts them in their own place.
4	4	10	From his flesh the palâsa was produced, whence that (tree) has much juice, and (that) red juice , for red, as it were, is flesh: with that quality he thus endows it. The khadira (stakes) are inside, and the palâsa ones outside, for inside are the bones, and outside is the flesh: he thus puts them in their own place.
4	4	11	And as to why there are twenty-one (stakes), twenty-one cubits long,--twenty-one-fold, indeed, is he that shines yonder --there are twelve months, five seasons, these three worlds, and yonder sun is the twenty-first, and he is the Asvamedha, and this Pragâpati. Having thus completely restored this Pragâpati, the sacrifice, he therein seizes twenty-one Agnîshomîya victims: for these there is one and the same performance, and this is the performance of the day before (the first Sutyâ).
5	1	1	Then, on the morrow, there is (used) Gotama's Stoma (form of chanting) successively increasing by four (verses) : the Bahishpavamâna thereof is on four, the Âgya (stotras) on eight, the Mâdhyandina Pavamâna on twelve, the Prishtha (stotras) onsixteen, the Ârbhava Pavamâna on twenty, and the Agnishtoma-sâman on twenty-four (verses).
5	1	2	Now, some make its Agnishtoma-sâman a Sâman of four (verses), saying, 'It is neither an Agnishtoma, nor an Ukthya .' If they do so, let hire (the Hotri),after reciting the Stotriya  (strophe) together, recite the Anurûpa (strophe) together: the Rathantara Prishtha-sâman , the Sastra containing the Rathantara (text), and the Agnishtoma sacrifice--thereby he makes sure of this world.
5	1	3	'There are twenty-one Savanîya  victims, all of them sacred to Agni: for these there is one and the same performance,' so say some; but, indeed, he should immolate two sets of eleven (victims), with the view of his obtainment of whatever desired object there may be in (victims) belonging to a set of eleven.
5	1	4	When the Agnishtoma is completed, and the Vasatîvarî water carried round, the Adhvaryu performs the Annahomas  (oblations of food): the import of these has been explained. With twelve Anuvâkas , 'To the in-breathing hail! To the off-breathing hail!' (he offers)--twelve months are a year, and the year is everything, and the Asvamedha is everything: thus it is for his obtaining and securing everything.
5	1	5	The central day is an ekavimsa day ; for the twenty-one-fold is yonder sun, and he is the Asvamedha: by means of his own Stoma he thus establishes him in his own deity,--therefore it is an ekavimsa day.
5	1	6	And, again, as to why it is an ekavimsa day;--man is twenty-one-fold--ten fingers, ten toes, and the body (self) as the twenty-first: by means of that twenty-one-fold self he thus establishes him in the twenty-one-fold (day) as on a firm foundation,--therefore it is an ekavimsa day.
5	1	7	And, again, as to why it is an ekavimsa day;--the ekavimsa, assuredly, is the foundation of Stomas, and manifold is that ever-varying performance which takes place on this day,--and it is because he thinks that that manifold and ever-varying performance which takes place on this day, shall take place so as to be established on the ekavimsa as a firm foundation, that this is an ekavimsa day.
5	1	8	Now, as to the morning-service of this day. The Hotri, having recited as the Âgya (hymn ) in the Paṅkti (metre) 'Agni I think on, who is good . . .,' recites thereto the one of a one-day's Soma-sacrifice . And the Bârhata Praüga and the Mâdhukhandasa one he recites both together  in triplets--(this being done) for the obtainment of the objects of desire which (may be contained) both in the Bârhata and the Mâdhukhandasa Praüga. The morning-service is (thus) set right.
5	1	9	Then as to the midday-service. For the obtainment of the Asvamedha, the atikhandas , 'In the three troughs the buffalo drank the barley-draught,' is the opening verse of the Marutvatîya (sastra); for outstanding, indeed, is this atikhandas (hypercatalectic verse) amongst metres, and outstanding is the Asvamedha amongst sacrifices. This (verse), being recited thrice, amounts to a triplet, and thereby he obtains the object of desire which (may be contained) in the triplet. 'Here, O good one, is the pressed plant'  is the 'anukara' (sequent triplet): this same (triplet) is the constantconnecting link of the one-day's sacrifice . Having recited both the paṅkti  'Here in the Soma-draught alone (the Brahman gave thee strength),' and the six-footed ones  'The patron thou art of the offerer of Soma,' he inserts the Nivid in the (hymn) of the one-day's sacrifice. Thus as to the Marutvatîya (-sastra).
5	1	10	Then as to the Nishkevalya (-sastra ). The Mahânâmnî (verses) are the Prishtha (-stotra); and he recites them along with the anurûpa (verses) and pragâtha (-strophes), for the obtainment of all the objects of his desire, for in the Mahânâmnîs, as well as in the Asvamedha, are contained all objects of desire. Having recited the paṅkti verses  'Indra hath grown in ebriety and strength,' and the six-footed ones  'This sacred work didst thou protect infights with Vritra,' he inserts the Nivid in the (hymn) of the one-day's sacrifice . The midday-service is (thus) set right.
5	1	11	Then as to the evening-service. The atîkhandas verse , 'Unto that god Savitri within the two bowls (do I sing praises ),' is the opening verse  of the Vaisvadeva(-sastra ): the mystic import thereof is the same as of the former (atikhandas verse). The Anukara  , 'Unto (abhi) thee, (the lord of treasures), O god Savitri, (ever helpful we come for our share . . .),' contains (the word) 'abhi,' as a form (sign) of victory (abhibhûti). Having recited the Sâvitra , 'Up rose this god Savitri, the friend of the house . . .,' he inserts the Nivid in the (hymn) of the one-day's sacrifice . Having recited the four verses to Heaven and Earth , 'The mighty Heaven and Earth, the most glorious, here . . .,' he inserts the Nivid in the  of the one-day's sacrifice. Having recited the Ârbhava , 'Ribhu, Vibhvan, Indra, Vâga, come ye to this our sacrifice . . .,'he inserts the Nivid in the  of the one-day's sacrifice. Having recited the  to the All-gods, 'Who is there righteous unto you, Mitra and Varuna? . . .,' he inserts the Nivid in the  of the one-day's sacrifice. Thus as to the Vaisvadeva (-sastra).
5	1	12	Then as to the Âgnimâruta . Having recited the  to (Agni) Vaisvânara, 'The head of the sky, and the disposer of the earth . . .,' he inserts the Nivid in the  of the one-day's sacrifice. Having recited the  to the Maruts, 'Hither, O Rudras, come ye united with Indra . . .,' he inserts the Nivid in the  of the one-day's sacrifice. Having recited the nine verses  to Gâtavedas, 'This guest of yours, the early-waking . . .,' he inserts the Nivid in the  of the one-day's sacrifice. And as to why the (hymns) of the one-day's sacrifice are used for inserting the Nivid, it is for the sake of his (the Sacrificer's) not being deprived of a firm foundation, for the Gyotishtoma is a foundation.
5	1	13	For this (day) there are those sacrificial animals--'A horse, a hornless he-goat, and a Gomriga ,' fifteen 'paryaṅgyas': the mystic import of these has been explained. Then these wild ones--for spring he seizes (three) kapiñgalas , for summer sparrows, for the rainy season partridges: of these(wild animals) also (the mystic import) has been told .
5	1	14	Then those (victims) for the twenty-one (stakes). He seizes twenty-one animals for each of the (eleven) deities of the Seasonal offerings ; for as many as there are gods of the Seasonal offerings so many are all the gods; and all objects of desire are in the Asvamedha: 'by gratifying all the deities I shall gain all my desires,' so he thinks. But let him not proceed in this way.
5	1	15	Let him seize seventeen victims for the central stake , in order that he may gain and secure every-thing,for the seventeenfold is Pragâpati, and the seventeenfold (stoma) is everything, and the Asvamedha is everything;--and sixteen at each of the other (stakes) in order that he may gain and secure everything, for everything here consists of sixteen parts, and the Asvamedha is everything. Thirteen wild (beasts) he seizes for each intermediate space, in order that he may gain and secure everything, for the year consists of thirteen months, and the Asvamedha is everything.
5	1	16	Now, prior to the (chanting of the) Bahishpavamâna, they (the assistants of the Adhvaryu) bring up the horse, after cleansing it; and with it they glide along for the Pavamâna: the mystic import of this has been explained . When the Bahishpavamâna has been chanted, they make the horse step on the place of chanting: if it sniffs, or turns away, let him know that his sacrifice is successful. Having led up that (horse), the Adhvaryu says, 'Hotri, sing praises!' and the Hotri sings its praises  with eleven --
5	1	17	'When, first born, thou didst neigh . . .'--thrice (he praises) with the first, and thrice with the last (verse), these amount to fifteen,--fifteenfold is the thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt means vigour: with that thunderbolt, vigour, the Sacrificer thus from the very first repels evil: thus , indeed, it is to the Sacrificer that the thunderbolt is given inorder to smite for him whoever is to be smitten.--, The swift racer hath gone forward to the slaying. . . .'--'The racer hath gone forward to the highest place. . .'--
5	1	18	Having omitted these two (verses), he inserts the hymn , 'Never (shall forget us) Mitra, Varuna, Aryaman, Âyu . . .,' in the Adhrigu  (litany). Some, however, insert this verse , 'Thirty-four (ribs) of the steed, akin to the gods, (doth the knife hit) . . .,' before the (passage,--'twenty-six are its) ribs,' thinking lest they should place the holy syllable 'om' in the wrong place , or lest they should suggest the plural by a singular . Let him not proceed thus, but let him insert the hymn as a whole.--'The swift racer hath gone forward to the slaying . . .'--The racer hath gone forward to the highest place . . .'--
5	2	1	Having uttered these two (verses), he pronounces what remains of the Adhrigu. 'A cloth, an upper cloth, and gold,' this is what they spread out for the horse : thereon they 'quiet' (slaughter) it. When the victims have been 'quieted,' the (king's) wives come up with water for washing the feet,--four wives; and a young maiden as the fifth, and four hundred female attendants.
5	2	2	When the foot-water is ready, they cause the Mahishî to lie down near the horse, and cover her up with the upper cloth, with 'In heaven ye envelop yourselves,'--for that indeed is heaven where they immolate the victim, . . ., 'May the vigorous male, the layer of seed, lay seed!' she says  for the completeness of union.
5	2	3	Whilst they are lying there, the Sacrificer addresses the horse , 'Utsakhyâ ava gudam dhehi!' No one replies to him, lest there should be some one to rival the Sacrificer.
5	2	4	The Adhvaryu then addresses the maiden, 'Hey hey maiden, that little bird . . .'--The maiden replies to him, 'Adhvaryu! that little bird . . .'
5	2	5	And the Brahman addresses the Mahishî, 'Mahishî, hey hey Mahishî, thy mother and father mount to the top of the tree . . .'--She has a hundred daughters of kings attending upon her: thesereply to the Brahman, 'Brahman, hey hey Brahman, thy mother and father play on the top of the tree. . .'
5	2	6	And the Udgâtri addresses the favourite, 'Vâvâtâ, hey hey Vâvâtâ, turn upwards!' She has a hundred noble-women (râganyâ) attending upon her: these reply to the Udgâtri, 'Hey hey Udgâtri, turn upwards!'
5	2	7	And the Hotri says to the discarded wife, 'Parivriktâ, hey hey Parivriktâ, when large meets small in this amhubhedî . . .'--She has a hundred daughters of heralds and head-men of villages attending upon her: these reply to the Hotri, 'Hotri, hey hey Hotri, when the gods favoured the lalâmagu . . .'
5	2	8	Then the chamberlain addresses the fourth wife, 'Pâlâgalî, hey hey Pâlâgalî, when the deer eats the corn, one thinks not of the fat cattle . . .'--She has a hundred daughters of chamberlains and charioteers attending upon her: these reply to the chamberlain, 'Chamberlain, hey hey chamberlain, when the deer eats the corn, one thinks not of the fat cattle. . .'
5	2	9	These speeches, the derisive discourses, indeed are every kind of attainment, and in the Asvamedha all objects of desire are contained: 'By every kind of speech may we obtain all objects of our desire' thus thinking, they cause the Mahishî to rise, Those (women) then walk back in the same way as they had come; and the others finally utter the verse containing (the word) 'fragrant' , 'To Dadhikrâvan have I sung praises. . .'
5	2	10	For, indeed, life and the deities depart from those who at the sacrifice speak impure speech: it is their speech they thereby purify so that the deities may not depart from the divine service. Now (some) put the omentum of the Gomriga and that of the hornless he-goat upon the horse and then take it (to the Âhavanîya), saying, 'The horse has no omentum.' Let him not do so: of the horse he should certainly take the fat; the (omenta of the) others are normal.
5	2	11	When the omenta have been roasted, and when they have performed (the oblations) with the Svâhâs , and returned to the back (of the sacrificial ground), they hold a Brahmodya  (theological discussion) in the Sadas. Having entered by the front door, they sit down at their several hearths.
5	2	12	The Hotri asks the Adhvaryu , 'Who is it that walketh singly ?. . .' He replies to him , 'Sûrya (the sun) walketh singly. . .'
5	2	13	The Adhvaryu then asks the Hotri , 'Whose light is there equal to the sun?. . .' He replies to him , 'The Brahman (n.) is the light equal to the sun. . .'
5	2	14	The Brahman then asks the Udgâtri , 'I ask thee for the sake of knowledge, O friend of the gods ' and he replies , 'I too am at those three places .'
5	2	15	The Udgâtri then asks the Brahman , 'Into what (things) hath the Spirit  entered, ' and he replies , 'Into five (things) hath the spirit entered, and they are established in the spirit: this I reply unto thee thereon; not superior in wisdom art thou (to me).'
5	2	16	When this (verse) has been uttered, they rise and betake themselves from the Sadas eastwards to the Sacrificer. Haying come to him, seated in front of the Havirdhâna  (shed), they sit down in their several places.
5	2	17	The Hotri then asks the Adhvaryu , 'What was the first conception ?. . .' and he replies , 'The sky was the first conception. . .'
5	2	18	The Adhvaryu then asks the Hotri , 'Who, pray, is the tawny one (pisaṅgilâ)? ' and he replies , 'The tawny one is the uncreated (night) ; .'
5	2	19	The Brahman then asks the Udgâtri , 'How many kinds are thereof this (sacrifice), how many syllables?--' and he replies , 'Six kinds there are of this (sacrifice), a hundred syllables, .'
5	2	20	The Udgâtri then asks the Brahman , 'Who knoweth the navel of this world? ' and he replies , 'I know the navel of this world, '
5	2	21	The Sacrificer then asks the Adhvaryu , 'I ask thee about the farthest end of the earth, ;' and he replies , 'This altar-ground is the farthest end of the earth; .'
5	2	22	Verily, this is the complete attainment of speech, to wit the Brahmodya, and in the Asvamedha all desires are contained: 'By means of all speech may we obtain all our desires!' so (they think).
5	2	23	When the colloquy has been held, the Adhvaryu enters the (Havirdhâna), and draws Pragâpati's (first) Mahiman cup (of Soma) in a gold vessel. The Puroruk formula  thereof is , 'The golden germ was first produced . . .' And its Puronuvâkyâ is , 'Of good nature, self-existent at first (within the great ocean: I verily place the right germ whence is born Pragâpati).'--'May the Hotri offer to Pragâpati: ' is the Praisha . The Hotri utters the offering-formula , 'O Pragâpati, none other than thee hath encompassed all these forms  . . . ;' and as the Vashat is pronounced, he (the Adhvaryu) offers with , 'What greatness of thine there hath been in the day, and the year, ' He does not repeat the Vashat, for he offers the cup of Soma all at once.
5	3	1	Now as to the offering of the omenta. 'They should proceed with them singly up to the omentum of the Vaisvadeva (victim) ; and when the omentum of the Vaisvadeva has been offered, they should thereupon offer the others,' said Satyakâma Gâbâla; 'for, doubtless, the All-Gods (Visve Devâh) are all (sarve) the gods: it is in this way he gratifies them deity after deity.'
5	3	2	'When the omentum of the Aindrâgna (victim) has been offered, they should thereupon offer the others,' said the two Saumapa Mânutantavya;'for, doubtless, Indra and Agni are all the gods: it is in this way he gratifies them deity after deity.'
5	3	3	'When the omentum of the (victim) sacred to Ka has been offered, they should thereupon offerthe others,' said Sailâli; 'for, doubtless, Ka is Pragâpati, and behind Pragâpati are all the gods: it is in this way he gratifies them deity after deity.'
5	3	4	'Having gone through the twenty-one deities of the Seasonal  (victims), let them proceed by dividing (the omenta) into twenty-one parts ,' said Bhâllaveya; 'for as many as there are Seasonal deities so many are all the gods: it is in this way he gratifies them deity after deity.'
5	3	5	'Let them proceed (with the omenta) singly and not otherwise,' said Indrota Saunaka; 'why, indeed, should they hasten? It is in this way he gratifies them deity after deity.' This, then, is what these have said, but the established practice is different therefrom.
5	3	6	Now Yâgñavalkya said, 'They should proceed simultaneously with the (omenta) of Pragâpati's  (victims), and simultaneously with those consecrated to single gods: it is in this way that he gratifies them deity after deity, that he goes straightway to the completion of the sacrifice, and does not stumble.'
5	3	7	When the omenta have been offered, the Adhvaryu enters (the Havirdhâna shed) and draws Pragâpati's second Mahiman cup of Soma in a silver vessel. The Puroruk thereof is , 'He who by his greatness hath become the one king of the breathing and blinking world, .' The Anuvâkyâ and Yâgyâ are interchanged so as to (ensure) unimpaired vigour , and the Praisha (direction to Hotri) is the same (as that of the first cup). As the Vashat is uttered, he offers with , 'What greatness of thine there hath been in the night, and the year, .' He does not repeat the Vashat: the significance of this has been explained.
5	3	8	Of the blood of the other victims they make no sacrificial portions; of (that of) the horse they do make portions . Of (the blood of) the others they make portions  on the south side, of (that of) the horse on the north side (of the altar); of (the blood of) the others he makes portions on (a mat of) plaksha (ficus infectoria) twigs, of (that of) the horse on rattan twigs.
5	3	9	But concerning this, Sâtyayagñi said, 'They may indeed do it in either way, only one must not depart from the (right) path.' But the former, indeed, is the established practice. The sacrifice (of the second day) is an Ukthya: thereby he causes the air-world to prosper. The last day is an Atirâtra with all the Stomas, for him to obtain and secure everything, for the Atirâtra with all the Stomas is everything, and the Asvamedha is everything.
5	3	10	Its Bahishpavamâna (stotra) is in the Trivrit , the Âgya (stotras) in the Pañkadasa , the Mâdhyandina-pavamâna in the Saptadasa , the Prishthas in the Ekavimsa , the Tritîya Pavamâna in the Trinava , the Agnishtoma-sâman in the Trayastrimsa , the Ukthas in the Ekavimsa , the Shodasin in the Ekavimsa, the night (chants) in the Pañkadasa, the Sandhi (twilight chant) in the Trivrit . Whatever Sastra is (recited) for the second day of the Prishthya Shadaha that is (used at) the Atirâtra sacrifice ; thereby he causes yonder (heavenly) world to prosper.
5	3	11	'There are twenty-one Savanîya victims, all of them consecrated to Agni, and there is one and the same performance for them,' so say some; but let him rather immolate those twenty-four bovine (victims ) for twelve deities,--twelve months are a year, and the year is everything, and the Asvamedhais everything: thus it is for the sake of his obtaining and securing everything.
5	4	1	Now, Indrota Daivâpa Saunaka once performed this sacrifice for Ganamegaya Pârikshita, and by performing it he extinguished all evil-doing, all Brahman-slaughter; and, verily, he who performs the Asvamedha extinguishes (the guilt incurred by) all evil-doing, all Brahman-slaughter.
5	4	2	It is of this, indeed, that the Gâthâ (strophe) sings,--'In Âsandîvat , Ganamegaya bound for the gods a black-spotted, grain-eating horse, adorned with a golden ornament and with yellow garlands.'
5	4	3	those same first two days , and a Gyotis  Atirâtra: therewith (they sacrificed) for Bhîmasena;--those same first two days, and a Go Atirâtra: therewith (they sacrificed) for Ugrasena;--those same first two days, and an Âyus Atirâtra: therewith (they sacrificed) for Srutasena. These are the Pârikshitîyas , and it is of this that the Gâthâ sings,--'The righteous Pârikshitas, performing horse-sacrifices, by their righteous work did away with sinful work one after another.'
5	4	4	Those same first two days, and an Abhigit  Atirâtra,--therewith Para Âtnâra, the Kausalya king, once sacrificed: it is of this that Gâthâ sings,--'Atnâra's son, the Kausalya Para, Hairanyanâbha, caused a horse, meet for sacrifice, to be bound, and gave away the replete regions.'
5	4	5	Those same first two days, and a Visvagit  Atirâtra,--therewith Purukutsa, the Aikshvâka king, once on a time performed a horse (daurgaha)-sacrifice, whence it is of this that the Rishi sings ,--'These, the seven Rishis, were then our fathers when Daurgaha  was bound.'
5	4	6	Those same first two days, and a Mahâvrata  Atirâtra,--therewith Marutta Âvikshita, the Âyogava king, once performed sacrifice; whence the Maruts became his guards-men, Agni his chamberlain, and the Visve Devâh his counsellors: it is of this that the Gâthâ sings,--'The Maruts dwelt as guards-men in Marutta Âvikshita's house, Agni as his chamberlain, and the Visve Devâh as his counsellors.' And, verily, the Maruts become the guards-men, Agni the chamberlain, and the Visve Devâh the counsellors of him who performs the horse-sacrifice.
5	4	7	Those same first two days, and an Aptoryâma  Atirâtra,--it was therewith that Kraivya, the Pâñkâla king, once performed sacrifice,--for Krivis they formerly called the Pañkâlas: it is of this that the Gâthâ sings,--'At Parivakrâ, the Pâñkâla overlord of the Krivis seized a horse, meet for sacrifice, with offering-gifts of a hundred thousand (head of cattle).'
5	4	8	And a second (Gâthâ),--'A thousand myriads there were, and five-and-twenty hundreds, which the Brâhmanas of the Pañkâlas from every quarter divided between them.'
5	4	9	The Agnishtoma in the Trivrit (stoma); the Ukthya in the Pañkadasa; and the third day, with the Uktha (stotras), in the Saptadasa; the Shodasin (stotra) in the Ekavimsa, the night (stotras) in the Pañkadasa, and the Sandhi (stotra) in the Trivrit,--this is the (sacrifice) resulting in the Anushtubh : it is therewith that sacrifice was performed by Dhvasan Dvaitavana, the king of the Matsyas, where there is the lake Dvaitavana; and it is of this that the Gâthâ sings,--'Fourteen steeds did king Dvaitavana, victorious in battle, bind for Indra Vritrahan, whence the lake Dvaitavana (took its name).'
5	4	10	The (three) Pavamâna (stotras) in the Katurvimsa (stoma), and (those performed) by repetitions  in the Trivrit; the Pavamânas in the Katuskatvârimsa , and (those performed) by repetition  in the Ekavimsa; the Pavamânas inthe Ashtâkatvârimsa , and (those performed) by repetition in the Trayastrimsa  up to the Agnishtoma-sâman, the Uktha (stotras) in the Dvâtrimsa , the Shodasin in the Ekavimsa, the night (stotras) in the Pañkadasa, and the Sandhi (stotra) in the Trivrit
5	4	11	Suchlike is Vishnu's striding ,--it was therewith that Bharata Dauhshanti once performed sacrifice, and attained that wide sway which now belongs to the Bharatas: it is of this that the Gâthâ sings,--'Seventy-eight steeds did Bharata Dauhshanti bind for the Vritra-slayer on the Yamunâ, and fifty-five near the Gaṅgâ.'
5	4	12	And a second (Gâthâ),--'Having bound a hundred and thirty-three horses, meet for sacrifice, king Saudyumni, more shifty, overcame the other shiftless ones.'
5	4	13	And a third,--'At Nâdapit , the Apsaras Sakuntalâ conceived Bharata, who, after conquering the whole earth, brought to Indra more than a thousand horses, meet for sacrifice.'
5	4	14	And a fourth ,--'The greatness of Bharata neither the men before nor those after him attained, nor did the five (tribes of) men, even as a mortal man (does not touch) the sky with his arms.'
5	4	15	With the Ekavimsa-stoma  Rishabha Yâgñatura,king of the Sviknas, performed sacrifice: it is of this that the Gâthâ sings,--'When Rishabha Yâgñatura was sacrificing, the Brahman-folk, having received wealth at the Asvamedha, divided the offering-gifts between them.'
5	4	16	With the Trayastrimsa-stoma Sona Sâtrâsâha, the Pâñkâla king, performed sacrifice: it is of this that the Gâthâ sings,--'When Sâtrâsâha performs the horse-sacrifice, the Trayastrimsa (stomas) come forth as (Taurvasa) horses, and six thousand mail-clad men .
5	4	17	And a second (Gâthâ),--'At the sacrifice of thee, Koka's father, the Trayastrimsa (stomas) come forth, each as six times six thousand  (horses), and six thousand mail-clad men.'
5	4	18	And a third,--'When Sâtrâsâha, the Pâñkâla king, was sacrificing, wearing beautiful garlands, Indra revelled in Soma, and the Brâhmanas became satiated with wealth.'
5	4	19	Satânîka Sâtrâgita performed the Govinata (form of Asvamedha), after taking away thehorse of the Kâsya (king); and since that time the Kâsis do not keep up the (sacrificial) fires, saying, 'The Soma-drink has been taken from us.'
5	4	20	The mode (of chanting) for this (Govinata form) is:--the Pavamâna (stotras) in the Katurvimsa (stoma), and (those chanted) by repetitions in the Trivrit;--the Pavamânas in the Katuskatvârimsa, the Âgya (stotras) in the Ekavimsa, the Ukthas  In the Trinava, the Prishthas in the Ekavimsa;--the Pavamânas in the Shattrimsa , and (those chanted) by repetitions in the Trayastrimsa  up to the Agnishtoma-sâman, the Ukthas in the Ekavimsa, the Shodasin in the Ekavimsa, the night (stotras) in the Pañkadasa, and the Sandhi (stotra) in the Trivrit.
5	4	21	It is of this that the Gâthâ sings,--'Satânîka Sâtrâgita seized a sacrificial horse, in the neighbourhood, the sacrifice of the Kâsis, even as Bharata (seized that) of the Satvats.'
5	4	22	And a second,--'The mighty Satânîka, having seized, in the neighbourhood, Dhritarâshtra's white sacrificial horse, roaming at will in its tenth month, Satânîka  performed the Govinata-sacrifice.'
5	4	23	And a fourth ,--'The greatness of the Bharatas neither the men before nor those after them attained, nor did the seven (tribes of) men, even as a mortal man (does not touch) the sky with his flanks.'
5	4	24	Now as to the sacrificial gifts. Whatever there is towards the middle of the kingdom other than the land, the men, and the property of the Brâhmana, of that the eastern region belongs to the Hotri, the southern to the Brahman, the western to the Adhvaryu, the northern to the Udgâtri; and the Hotrikas share this along with them.
5	4	25	When the Udayanîyâ (completing offering) is finished, he seizes twenty-one barren cows, sacred to Mitra-Varuna, the Visve Devâh, and Brihaspati, with the view of his gaining those deities. And the reason why those sacred to Brihaspati come last is that Brihaspati is the Brahman (n.), and he thus establishes himself finally in the Brahman.
5	4	26	And as to their being twenty-one of them,--the twenty-one-fold is he who shines yonder: twelve months, five seasons, these three worlds, and yonder sun as the twenty-first--this consummation (he thereby obtains).
5	4	27	When the Udavasânîyâ (closing offering) is completed, they give, for a sacrificial gift, four women, with a maiden as the fifth, and four hundred female attendants according to agreement.
5	4	28	And during the following year he performs the animal sacrifices of the seasons,--six (victims) sacred to Agni in the spring, six to Indra in the summer, six to Parganya, or to the Maruts, in the rainy season, six to Mitra and Varuna in the autumn, six to Indra and Vishnu in the winter, and six to Indra and Brihaspati in the dewy season,--six seasons are a year: in the seasons, in the year, he thus establishes himself. These amount to thirty-six animals,--the Brihatî (metre) consists of thirty-six syllables, and the heavenly world is establishedupon the Brihatî: and thus he finally establishes himself, by means of the Brihatî metre, in the heavenly world.
6	1	1	Purusha Nârâyana desired, 'Would that I overpassed all beings! would that I alone were everything here (this universe)!' He beheld this five-days’ sacrificial performance, the Purushamedha, and took it , and performed offering therewith; and having performed offering therewith, he overpassed all beings, and became everything here. And, verily, he who, knowing this, performs the Purushamedha, or who even knows this, overpasses all beings, and becomes everything here.
6	1	2	For this (offering) there are twenty-three Dîkshâs, twelve Upasads, and five Sutyâs (Soma-days). This, then, being a forty-days’ (performance), including the Dîkshâs and Upasads, amounts to a Virâg , for the Virâg consists of forty syllables:  'Thence  Virâg (f.) was born, and from out of Virâg the Pûrusha.' This, then, is that Virâg, and from out of that Virâg he (the Sacrificer) generates the Purusha, the Sacrifice.
6	1	3	Now these (forty days) are four decades; and as to there being these four decades, it is for the obtainment of these worlds, as well as of the regions: by the first decade they  obtained even this (terrestrial) world, by the second the air, by the third the sky, and by the fourth the regions (quarters); and in like manner does the Sacrificer, by the first decade, obtain even this (terrestrial) world, by the second the air, by the third the sky, and by the fourth the regions--and, indeed, as much as these worlds and the regions are, so much is all this (universe); and the Purushamedha is everything: thus it is for the sake of his obtaining and securing everything.
6	1	4	On the Upavasatha  (day) there are eleven victims sacred to Agni and Soma: the performance for these is one and the same. There are eleven stakes,--the Trishtubh (verse) consists of eleven syllables, and the Trishtubh is a thunderbolt, and the Trishtubh is vigour: with the thunderbolt, with vigour, the Sacrificer thus from the first repels evil.
6	1	5	On the Sutyâ (days) there are the (Savanîya) victims of the set of eleven  (stakes),--the Trishtubh consists of eleven syllables, and the Trishtubh is a thunderbolt, and the Trishtubh is vigour: with the thunderbolt, with vigour, the Sacrificer thus from the first repels evil.
6	1	6	And, again, as to why there are (the victims) of the set of eleven (stakes): it is for the sake of his obtaining and securing everything, for the set of eleven (stakes) is everything, since the set of eleven (stakes) is Pragâpati, and Pragâpati is everything, and the Purushamedha is everything.
6	1	7	Now this Purushamedha is a five-days’ sacrificial performance--the sacrifice is fivefold, the victim is fivefold, and five seasons are a year: whatsoever of five kinds there is, either concerning the deity or the self (body), all that he thereby obtains.
6	1	8	The first day thereof is an Agnishtoma; then (follows) an Ukthya, then an Atirâtra, then an Ukthya, then an Agnishtoma: this (sacrifice) thus has light (gyotis ) on both sides, and an Ukthya on both sides (of the central Atirâtra).
6	1	9	It is a five-days’ (sacrifice), like a barley-corn in the middle ; for the Purushamedha is these worlds, and these worlds have light on both sides--through Agni (the sacrificial fire) on this side, and through Âditya (the Sun) on the other: therefore it has light on both sides. And the Ukthya is food, and the Atirâtra the body (self); and because there are these Ukthyas on both sides of the Atirâtra, therefore this body is surrounded by food. And that Atirâtra which is the largest of them is in. the middle, it is thereby that it (the body, or sacrifice) is like a barley-corn (yava) in the middle; and, verily,whosoever knows this repels (yu) his hateful enemy: 'He alone exists, not his hateful enemy,' thus they say of him.
6	1	10	The first day is for it this same (terrestrial) world, and the spring season  also is this its (terrestrial) world; and the second day is what there is above this (terrestrial) world and below the air, and the summer season also is that (part) of it; and the central day is its air, and the rainy and autumn seasons also are its air; and the fourth day is what is above the air, and below the sky, and the winter season also is that (part) of it; and its fifth day is the sky, and the dewy season also is its sky: thus as to the deities.
6	1	11	Then as to the body . The first day is its feet, and the spring season also is its feet; and the second day is what is above the feet, and below the waist, and the summer season also is that (part) of it; and the central day is its waist, and the rainy and autumn seasons also are its waist; the fourth day is what is above the waist and below the head, and the winter season also is that (part) of it; and the fifth day is its head, and the dewy season also is its head:--thus these worlds, as well as the year and the (sacrificer's) self, pass into the Purushamedha for the obtainment and securing of everything, for, indeed, these worlds are everything, and the year is everything, and the self is everything, and the Purushamedha is everything.
6	2	1	And as to why it is called Purushamedha:--The stronghold (pur) doubtless is these worlds, and the Purusha (spirit) is he that blows here (the wind), he bides (sî) in this stronghold (pur): hence he is the Purusha. And whatever food there is in these worlds that is its 'medha,' its food; and inasmuch as this is its 'medha,' its food, therefore (it is called) Purushamedha. And inasmuch as at this (sacrifice) he seizes  men (purusha) meet for sacrifice (medhya), therefore also it is called Purushamedha.
6	2	2	He seizes them on the central day, for the central day is the air, and the air is the abode of all beings; and, indeed, these victims are also food, and the central day is the belly: he thus puts food in the belly.
6	2	3	He seizes them by decades  for the obtainmentof all food, for the Virâg consists of ten syllables, and the Virâg is all food .
6	2	4	Eleven decades  he seizes;--the Trishtubh consists of eleven syllables, and the Trishtubh is the thunderbolt, and vigour: with the thunderbolt, with vigour, the Sacrificer thus repels evil from within him.
6	2	5	Forty-eight he seizes at the central stake;--the Gagatî consists of forty-eight syllables, and cattle are of Gâgata (movable) nature: by means of the Gagatî he (the priest) secures cattle for him.
6	2	6	Eleven at each of the others;--the Trishtubh consists of eleven syllables, and the Trishtubh is the thunderbolt, and vigour: with the thunderbolt,with vigour, the Sacrificer thus repels evil from about him.
6	2	7	Last of all he seizes eight;--the Gâyatrî consists of eight syllables, and the Gâyatrî is the Brahman (n.): he thus makes the Brahman to be the ultimate thing of this universe, whence they say that the Brahman is the ultimate thing of this universe.
6	2	8	These (eight) are sacred to Pragâpati, Pragâpati assuredly is the Brahman, for Pragâpati is of the nature of the Brahman : therefore they are sacred to Pragâpati.
6	2	9	When about to bring up the victims, he offers those three oblations to Savitri, with , 'God Savitri, (speed the sacrifice, speed the lord of sacrifice unto his share)!'--'May we obtain that glorious light of the God Savitri, (who shall inspire our prayers)!'--'All troubles remove thou from us, O God Savitri: bestow unto us what is auspicious!' He thus pleases Savitri, and thus pleased with him, he (Savitri) impels (speeds) those (sacrificial) men, and he seizes them impelled by that (Savitri).
6	2	10	For the priesthood he seizes a Brâhmana, for the Brâhmana is the priesthood: he thus joins priesthood to priesthood ;--for the nobility he seizes a Râganya, for the Râganya is the nobility: he thus joins nobility to nobility;--for the Maruts (he seizes) a Vaisya, for the Maruts are the clans (peasants): he thus joins peasantry to peasantry;--for (religious) toil (he seizes) a Sûdra, for the Sûdra is toil: he thus joins toil to toil;--according to their particular form he thus supplies these divinities with victims, and, thus supplied, they supply him with all his objects of desire.
6	2	11	He makes offering with ghee, for ghee is fiery mettle: by means of fiery mettle he thus endows him (the Sacrificer) with fiery mettle. He makes offering with ghee, for that--to wit, ghee--is the dear resource of the gods: he thus supplies them with their dear resource, and, thus supplied, they supply him with all his objects of desire.
6	2	12	By means of the Purusha Nârâyana (litany), the Brahman priest (seated) to the right (south) of them, praises the men bound (to the stakes) with this sixteen-versed , 'The thousand-headed Purusha, thousand-eyed, thousand-footed  . . .;'--thus (he does) for the obtainment and the securing of everything, for everything here consists of sixteen parts, and the Purushamedha is everything: in thus saying, 'So and so thou art, so and so thou art,' he praises and thereby indeed magnifies him (Purusha); but he also thereby speaks of him, such as he is. Now, the victims had had the fire carried round them, but they were not yet slaughtered,--
6	2	13	Then a voice  said to him, 'Purusha, do notconsummate (these human victims ): if thou wert to consummate them, man (purusha) would eat man.' Accordingly, as soon as fire had been carried round them, he set them free, and offered oblations to the same divinities , and thereby gratified those divinities, and, thus gratified, they, gratified him with all objects of desire.
6	2	14	He makes offering with ghee, for ghee is fiery mettle: with fiery mettle he thus bestows fiery mettle upon him.
6	2	15	He concludes with those of the set of eleven (stakes),--the Trishtubh consists of eleven syllables, and the Trishtubh is the thunderbolt, and vigour: with the thunderbolt, with vigour, the Sacrificer thus repels evil from within.
6	2	16	The Udayanîyâ (concluding oblation) having been completed, he seizes eleven barren cows, sacred to Mitra-Varuna, the Visve Devâh, and Brihaspati , with the view of winning these deities. And as to those of Brihaspati being last,--Brihaspati truly is the Brahman (n.), and thus he finally establishes himself in the Brahman.
6	2	17	And as to why there are eleven of them,--the Trishtubh consists of eleven syllables, and the Trishtubh is the thunderbolt, and vigour: with the thunderbolt, with vigour, the Sacrificer thus repels evil from within. The Traidhâtavî is the final offering (Udavasânîyâ): the mystic import is the same (as before ).
6	2	18	Now as to the sacrificial fees. What there is towards the middle of the kingdom other than the land and the property of the Brâhmana, but including the men, of that the eastern quarter belongs to the Hotri, the southern to the Brahman, the western to the Adhvaryu, and the northern to the Udgâtri; and the Hotrikas share this along with them.
6	2	19	And if a Brâhmana performs the sacrifice, he should bestow all his property in order to obtain and secure everything, for the Brâhmana is everything, and all one's property is everything, and the Purushamedha is everything.
6	2	20	And having taken up the two fires within his own self , and worshipped the sun with the Uttara-Nârâyana , let him betake himself to the forest without looking round; and that (place), indeed, is apart from men. But should he wish to live in the village, let him take up again the two fires in the churning-sticks, and having worshipped the sun with the Uttara-Nârâyana (litany) let him dwell at his home, and let him offer such sacrifices as he maybe able to afford. But, indeed, this (sacrifice) is not to be imparted to any and every one, lest one should impart everything to any and every one, for the Purushamedha is everything; but one may only impart it to one who is known to him, and who is versed in sacred writ, and who may be dear to him, but not to any and every one.
7	1	1	Brahman Svayambhu (the self-existent, n.) was performing austerities . He said this much,-- 'Verily, there is no perpetuity in austerities; well, then, I will offer up mine own self in the creatures, and the creatures in mine own self.' And, accordingly, by offering up his own self in the creatures, and the creatures in his own self, he compassed the supremacy, the sovereignty, and the lordship over all creatures; and in like manner does the Sacrificer, by thus offering all sacrificial essences  in the Sarvamedha, compass all beings, and supremacy, sovereignty, and lordship.
7	1	2	Now this Sarvamedha is a ten-days’ (Soma-) sacrifice, for the sake of his gaining and winning every kind of food, for the Virâg consists of ten syllables, and the Virâg is all food. At this (sacrifice) he builds the greatest possible fire-altar, for this--to wit, the Sarvamedha--is supreme amongst all sacrificial performances: by means of the supreme (sacrifice) he thus causes him (the Sacrificer) to attain supremacy.
7	1	3	The first day thereof is an Agnishtut Agnishtoma , for the sake of his gaining and winning all the gods, for the Agnishtut Agnishtoma is Agni; and all the gods have Agni (the sacrificial fire) for their mouth, The cups of Soma thereat pertain to Agni, and so do the Puroruk  formulas pertain to Agni, in order that everything should pertain to Agni.
7	1	4	The second day is an Indrastut Ukthya, for the sake of his gaining and winning all the gods, for Indra is all the gods. The cups of Soma thereat pertain to Indra, and so do the Puroruk formulas pertain to Indra, in order that everything should pertain to Indra.
7	1	5	The third day is a Sûryastut, Ukthya, for the sake of his gaining and winning all the gods, for Sûrya is all the gods. The cups of Soma pertain to Sûrya, and so do the Puroruk formulas pertain to Sûrya, in order that everything should pertain to Sûrya.
7	1	6	The fourth day is a Vaisvadeva, for the sake of his gaining and winning all the gods, for the All-gods (Visve Devâh) are all the gods. The cups of Soma pertain to the All-gods, and so do the Puroruk formulas pertain to the All-gods, in order that everything should pertain to the All-gods.
7	1	7	The fifth day is a central Âsvamedhika  one: at this (sacrifice) he seizes a horse meet for sacrifice, for the sake of his gaining the sacrificial essence of the horse.
7	1	8	The sixth day is a central Paurushamedhika  one: at this (sacrifice) he seizes men meet for sacrifice, for the sake of his gaining the sacrificial essence of man.
7	1	9	The seventh day is an Aptoryâma, for the sake of his gaining all kinds of Soma-sacrifices: at this (sacrifice) he seizes all kinds of (victims) meet for sacrifice, both what is animate and what isinanimate. Of those with omenta he offers the omenta, and of those without omenta they throw down pieces cut out of the skin , and of herbs and trees they do so after cutting them up,--every kind of food of both the dry and the fresh he offers, in order to gain every kind of food. Everything he offers; and, to every one he offers in order to gain and to win everything. The omenta having been offered at the morning-service, and in the same way the oblations at the evening-service,--
7	1	10	The eighth day is a Trinava one , for the Trinava (stoma) is the thunderbolt, and by means of the thunderbolt, indeed, lordship (kshatra) is gained: by means of the thunderbolt he thus gains lordship.
7	1	11	The ninth day is a Trayastrimsa one , for the sake of his gaining a foothold, for the Trayastrimsa (stoma) is a foothold.
7	1	12	The tenth day is a Visvagit Atirâtra with all the Prishthas , for the sake of his gaining and winning everything, for the Visvagit Atirâtra with all the Prishthas is everything, and the Sarvamedha is everything.
7	1	13	Now as to the sacrificial fees: whatever there is towards the middle of the kingdom other than the property of the Brâhmana, but including land andmen, of that the eastern quarter belongs to the Hotri, the southern to the Brahman, the western to the Adhvaryu, and the northern to the Udgâtri; and the Hotrikas share this along with them.
7	1	14	Visvakarman Bhauvana once performed this sacrifice, and having performed it he overpassed all beings, and became everything here; and verily he who, knowing this, performs the Sarvamedha, or who even knows this, overpasses all beings, and becomes everything here.
7	1	15	It was Kasyapa who officiated in his sacrifice, and it was concerning this that the Earth  also sang the stanza;--'No mortal must give me away; thou wast foolish, Visvakarman Bhauvana: she (the earth) will sink into the midst of the water; vain is this thy promise unto Kasyapa.'
8	1	1	They now  do what is auspicious for him. They now prepare a burial-place (smasâna ) for him, (to serve him) either as a house or as a monument; for when any one dies, he is a corpse (sava), and for that (corpse) food (anna) is thereby prepared, hence 'savanna,' for, indeed, 'savanna' is what is mystically called 'smasâna.' But 'smasâh' also are called the eaters amongst the Fathers, and they, indeed, destroy in yonder world the good deeds of him who has had no sepulchre prepared for him: it is for them that he prepares that food, whence it is 'smasânna,' for 'smasânna' is what is mystically called 'smasâna.'
8	1	2	Let him  not make it too soon (after the deceased man's death) lest he should freshen up his sin; but let him make it a long time after, as thereby he obscures the sin;--and when people do not even remember the years (that have passed ), as thereby one causes the sin to pass into oblivion. If they do remember ,--
8	1	3	Let him make it in uneven years, since the uneven belongs to the Fathers; and under a single Nakshatra , since the single Nakshatra belongs to the Fathers; and at new-moon, since the new-moon is a single Nakshatra;--for he (the Sacrificer) is a single (person); and in that all the beings dwell together during that night, thereby he obtains that object of desire which is (contained) in all Nakshatras.
8	1	4	Let him make it in autumn, for the autumn is the Svadhâ, and the Svadhâ is the food of the Fathers: he thus places him along with food, the Svadhâ;--or in (the month of) Mâgha, thinking, 'Lest (mâ) sin (agha) be in us;'--or in summer (nidâgha), thinking, 'May thereby be removed (nidhâ) our sin (agha)!'
8	1	5	Four-cornered (is the sepulchral mound). Now the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pragâpati, were contending in the (four) regions (quarters). The gods drove out the Asuras, their rivals and enemies, from the regions, and, being regionless, they were overcome. Wherefore the people who are godly make their burial-places four-cornered, whilst those who are of the Asura nature, the Easterns and others , (make them)round, for they (the gods) drove them out from the regions. He arranges it so as to lie between the two regions, the eastern and the southern , for in that region assuredly is the door to the world of the Fathers: through the above he thus causes him to enter the world of the Fathers; and by means of the (four) corners he (the deceased) establishes himself in the regions, and by means of the other body  (of the tomb) in the intermediate regions: he thus establishes him in all the regions.
8	1	6	Now as to the choosing of the ground. He makes it on ground inclining towards the north, for the north is the region of men: he thus gives him (the deceased) a share in the world of men; and in that respect, indeed, the Fathers share in the world of men that they have offspring; and his (the deceased man's) offspring will, indeed, be more prosperous.
8	1	7	'Let him make it on ground inclining towards the south,' they say, 'for the world of the Fathers inclines towards the south: he thus gives him a share in the world of the Fathers.' Let him not do so, however, for, indeed, such a one is an opening tomb, and certainly another of these (members of the dead man's family) quickly follows him in death.
8	1	8	And some, indeed, say, 'Let him make it on a counter-cutting  in ground inclined towards the south, for such (a tomb) indeed becomes rising sin .' But one must not do so, for indeed such (a burial place) alone becomes rising sin which one makes, on ground inclining towards the north.
8	1	9	On any level (ground) where the waters, flowing thither from a south-easterly direction , and coming to a stand-still, will, on reaching that (north-westerly) quarter, without pressing forward , join imperishable water , on that (ground) one may make (the tomb); for, water being food, one thereby offers food to him from the front towards the back; and, water being the drink of immortality, and that region between the rising of the seven Rishis  and the setting of the sun being the quarter of the living, one thereby bestows the drink of immortality upon the living:--and such a one, indeed, is a closing tomb; and verily what is good for the living that is also good for the Fathers.
8	1	10	Let him make it in a pleasant (spot), in order that there should be pleasure for him; and in a peaceful (spot), in order that there should be peace for him. He must not make it either on a path, or in an open space, lest he should make his (the deceased's) sin manifest.
8	1	11	Whilst being secluded it should have the sun shining on it from above : in that it is secluded one hides his sin; and in that it has the sun shining on it from above---yonder sun being the remover of evil--he, indeed, removes the evil from him, and he also causes him to be endowed with the radiance of the sun.
8	1	12	Let him not make it where it would be visible from here , for assuredly it is beckoning, and another of these (members of his family) quickly follows (the deceased) in death.
8	1	13	Let there be beautiful objects  at the back,--for beautiful objects mean offspring: beautiful objects, offspring, will thus accrue to him. If there be no beautiful objects, let there be water either at the back or on the left (north) side, for water is indeed a beautiful object; and beautiful objects, offspring, will indeed accrue to him.
8	1	14	He makes it on salt (barren) soil, for salt means seed; the productive thus makes him partake in productiveness, and in that respect, indeed, the Fathers partake in productiveness that they have offspring: his offspring assuredly will be more prosperous.
8	1	15	On such (ground) as is filled with roots, for to the Fathers belongs the (sod) filled with roots;--it is (sod) of vîrina (Andropogon muricatus) and other grasses, for thus the Fathers’ share in this (earth) is not excessive ; and he also thereby makes (the deceased's) sin to be restricted .
8	1	16	Let him not put it near (where grows) Bhûmipâsa , or reeds, or Asmagandhâ , or Adhyândâ, or Prisniparnî ('speckled-leaf,' Hemionitis cordifolia); nor let him make it near either an Asvattha (Ficus religiosa), or a Vibhîtaka (Terminalia bellerica), or a Tilvaka (Symplocos racemosa), or a Sphûrgaka (Diospyros embryopteris), or a Haridru (Pinus deodora), or a Nyagrodha (Ficus indica), orany other (trees) of evil name , so as to avoid (such) names from a desire of good luck.
8	1	17	Now as to the order of procedure. For an Agnikit (builder of a fire-altar) one makes the tomb after the manner of the fire-altar; for when a Sacrificer builds a fire-altar he thereby constructs for himself by sacrifice a (new) body for yonder world; but that sacrificial performance is not complete until the making of a tomb; and when he makes the tomb of the Agnikit after the manner of the fire-altar, it is thereby he completes the Agnikityâ.
8	1	18	One must not make it (too) large lest he should make the sin (of the deceased) large. 'Let him make it as large as the fire-altar without wings and tail,' say some, 'for like that of the fire-altar is this his (the Sacrificer's) body.'
8	1	19	But let him rather make it just of man's size: he thus leaves no room for another;--broader (varîyas) behind , for what is (left) behind is offspring: he thus makes the (dead man's) offspring more excellent  (varîyas);--and broader on the left (north  or higher, uttara) side, for the later (uttara)are offspring: he thus makes the offspring more excellent. Having attended to this, he encloses it with cords twisted (and extended) in the non-sunwise way ; for the (sacrificial) performance connected with the Fathers is done in the non-sunwise way.
8	1	20	He then bids them cut out (the earth). He should cut it out to whatever extent he intends to raise (the sepulchral mound), but let him rather cut it out so as to be just of man's size: he thus leaves no room for another. For, on the one hand , the Fathers are the world of plants, and amongst the roots of plants they (are wont to) hide; and, on the other , (he does so) lest he (the deceased) should be separated from this (earth).
8	2	1	Now, some bank up (the sepulchral mound) after covering up (the site). The gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pragâpati, were contending for (the possession of) this (terrestrial) world. The gods drove out the Asuras, their rivals and enemies, from this world; whence those whoare godly people make their sepulchres so as not to be separate (from the earth), whilst those (people) who are of the Asura nature, the Easterns and others, (make their sepulchral mounds) so as to be separated (from the earth), either on a basin  or on some such thing.
8	2	2	He then encloses it by means of enclosing-stones: what those enclosing-stones (round the fire-hearths) are, that they are here . With a formula he sets up those, silently these: he thus keeps separate what refers to the gods and what refers to the Fathers. With (an) undefined (number of stones he encloses it), for undefined is yonder world.
8	2	3	He then sweeps that (site) with a palâsa (Butea frondosa) branch--what the sweeping (signified) on that occasion , that (it does) here--with (Vâg. S. XXXV, I), 'Let the niggards avaunt from hence, the perverse scorners of the gods!'--he thereby expels from this world the niggards, the perverse haters of the gods, the Asura-Rakshas;--'it is the place of this Soma-offerer,' for he who has performed a Soma-sacrifice is a Soma-offerer;--'(an abode) distinguished by lights, by days, by nights,'--he thereby makes him tobe of the world of the seasons, the days and nights;--
8	2	4	'May Yama grant him an abode;'--for Yama has power over the abode in this (earth), and it is him he solicits for an abode therein for this (dead man). He throws out this (branch) to the right (south), the other  to the left (north) side: he thus keeps the divine separate from what belongs to the Fathers.
8	2	5	He (the Adhvaryu) then yokes (the team) to the plough on the south side,--some say on the north side: he may do as he chooses. Having given the order, saying, 'Yoke!' he (the Sacrificer) utters the formula , 'May Savitri vouchsafe for thy bones a place in the earth!'--Savitri now indeed vouchsafes a place in the earth for his (the deceased man's) bones;--'Let the oxen be yoked therefore!' for it is indeed for this work that the oxen are yoked.
8	2	6	It is (a team) of six oxen,--six seasons are a year: on the seasons, on the year, as a firm foundation, he thus establishes him. Having turned round (the plough) from right to left , he ploughs the first furrow with , 'May Vâyu purify!' along the north side (along the cord) towards the west ; with, 'May Savitri purify!' along the west side towards the south; with, 'With Agni's lustre!' along the south side towards the east; with, 'With Sûrya's brilliance!' along the front side towards the north.
8	2	7	Four furrows he ploughs with a formula: he thereby establishes him in whatever food there is in the four quarters. And (as to why it is done) with a formula,--certain, assuredly, is the sacrificial formula (yagus), and certain are these quarters.
8	2	8	He then ploughs across the body (of the sepulchral site)--he thereby establishes him in whatever food there is in the year --silently with (an) undefined (number of furrows), for undefined is yonder world.
8	2	9	Having performed the work for which he has put the team to that (plough), he now unfastens it: 'Let the oxen be unyoked!' he says, for it is for that work that the oxen were yoked. To the right (south) side  he removes this (plough and team), to the left (side) arty other: he thus keeps the divine separate from what' belongs to the Fathers.
8	3	1	He then sows (seed) of all (kinds of) herbs: what the all-herb (seed signified) on that occasion , that (it does) here. With many (verses ) he sowsthat (former seed), with a single one this,--he thus keeps the divine separate from what belongs to the Fathers,--with .
8	3	2	He then pours out that (jarful of bones ); for this earth is the foundation: on this (earth), as a foundation, he thus establishes him. Before sunrise (he does so), for, in secret, as it were, are the Fathers, and in secret, as it were, is the night;--in secret, indeed, he does this, (but) so that (the sun) should rise over him doing it: on both day and night he thus establishes him.
8	3	3	'May Savitri deposit thy bones in the mother's lap,'--Savitri thus deposits his bones in the lap of the mother, this earth;--'O Earth, be thou propitious unto him!' he thus says this in order that this (earth) may be propitious to him.--'In the deity Pragâpati I place thee, in the world nigh unto the water , O N.N.,' therewith he mentions the name (of the deceased); for nigh tothe water, indeed, is this (terrestrial) world: he thus places him in the deity Pragâpati, in the world nigh unto the water.
8	3	4	He then says to some one, 'Proceed in that (southern) direction without drawing breath, and, having thrown down the jar, return hither without looking behind thee!' He then mutters , 'O Death, go away another way, what second way there is of thine other than the path of the gods ; I call unto thee that hast eyes and hearest: hurt not our family nor our men!' for long life he thereby prays for these, and accordingly each subsequent one of them dies of old age.
8	3	5	He then arranges him (the dead man) limb by limb, with , 'Propitious be the wind unto thee, propitious the heat of the sun; propitious be the bricks; propitious be the fires unto thee, and may the earthly ones not scorch thee!--May the regions fit themselves to thee, and may the waters be most kind unto thee, and the rivers; and kind. also the air: may all the regions fit themselves to thee!'--he thereby makes everything fit itself to him, and be auspicious for him.
8	3	6	Now thirteen unmarked  bricks, measuring a foot (square), have been made: they are just like those bricks in the fire-altar. Those (altar bricks) he lays down with a formula, silently these: he thus keeps the divine separate from what belongs to the Fathers.
8	3	7	There are thirteen of them,--thirteen months are a year: on the seasons, on the year, he thus establishes him, as on a firm foundation.
8	3	8	They measure a foot (square),--the foot is a foundation: a foundation he thus prepares for him. Unmarked they are, for in secret, as it were, are the Fathers; and in secret, as it were, is what is unmarked: he thus secretes what is in secret.
8	3	9	One of them he places in the middle, with the front side towards the east: this is the body (trunk);--three in front, fitted to (the position of) the head: that is the head;--three on the right; that is the right wing (side);--three on the left: that is the left wing;--three behind: that is the tail. Thus this his body, furnished with wings and tail, is just like that of Agni (the fire-altar).
8	3	10	He then bids them bring some soil from a cleft in the ground, for thus the Fathers’ (share) in this (earth) is not excessive; and he also thereby makes the (dead man's) sin to be restricted . And some, now, dig in that intermediate (south-eastern) quarter, and fetch it from there; and others, again, do so towards the south-west, and fetch it northwards from there: he may do as he chooses.
8	3	11	Let him not make it (the sepulchral mound) too large, lest he make the (deceased's) sin large. For a Kshatriya he may make it as high as a man with upstretched arms, for a Brâhmana reaching up to the mouth, for a woman up to the hips, for a Vaisya up to the thighs, for a Sûdra up to the knee; for suchlike is their vigour.
8	3	12	But let him rather make it so as to reachbelow the knee: he thus leaves no room for another. While that (mound) is being made, they hold a bundle (of reed grass) to the left (north, uttaratah) of it,--that is offspring: they thus hold the (deceased's) offspring upwards (uttaratah). Do not let him throw it down either after holding it up, or after bringing it; but let him set it up in the house : he thus sets up offspring in the house.
8	3	13	Having prepared it, he sows barley grain (yava), thinking, 'May they ward off (yavaya) sin from me!' He covers it over with Avakâ-plants  in order that there may be joy (or moisture, ka) for him; and with Darbha grass (Poa cynosuroides) he covers it for the sake of softness.
8	4	1	They now fix pegs round it ,--a Palâsa (Butea frondosa) one in front,--for the Palâsa is the Brahman (n.): he thus makes him go to the heavenly world with the Brahman for his leader;--a Samî (Prosopis spicigera) one on the left (north corner), in order that there may be peace (sam) for him;--a Varana (Crataeva Roxburghii) one behind, in order that he may ward off (vâraya) sin from him;--and a Vritra-peg  on the right (south corner) for sin not to pass beyond.
8	4	2	On the right (south) side they then dig two somewhat curved (furrows ), and fill them with milk and water,--these, indeed, are two inexhaustible streams (that) flow to him in the other world;--and seven (they dig) on the left (north) side, and fill them with water, for sin not to pass beyond, for indeed sin cannot pass beyond seven rivers .
8	4	3	They  throw three stones each (into the northern furrows), and pass over them, with : 'Here floweth the stony one: hold on to each other, rise, and cross over, ye friends: here will we leave behind what unkind spirits there be, and will cross over to auspicious nourishments;'--as the text so its import.
8	4	4	They cleanse themselves with Apâmârga plants --they thereby wipe away (apa-marg) sin--with , 'O Apâmârga, drive thou away from us sin, away guilt, away witchery, away infirmity, away evil dreams!'--as the text so its import.
8	4	5	They bathe at any place where there is water. With , 'May the waters and plants be friendly unto us!' he takes water with his joined hands,--for water is a thunderbolt: with the thunderbolt he thus makes friendship,--and with, 'Unfriendly may they be unto him who hateth us, and whom we hate!' he throws it in the direction in which he who is hateful to him may be, and thereby overthrows him.
8	4	6	And if it be standing water, it makes their (the bathers’) evil stop; and if it flows, it carries away their evil. Having bathed, and put on garments that have never yet been washed, they hold on to the tail of an ox , and return (to their home),--for the ox is of Agni's nature: headed by Agni they thus return from the world of the Fathers to the world of the living. And Agni, indeed, is he who leads one over the paths (one has to travel), and it is he who leads these over.
8	4	7	They proceed (towards the village) muttering this verse , 'From out of the gloom have we risen  . . .'--from the gloom, the world of the Fathers, they now indeed approach the light, the sun. When they have arrived, ointments for the eyes and the feet are given them: such, indeed, are human means of embellishment, and therewith they keep off death from themselves.
8	4	8	Then, in the house, having made up the (domestic) fire, and laid enclosing-sticks of Varana wood round it, he offers, by means of a sruva-spoon of Varana wood, an oblation to Agni Âyushmat , for Agni Âyushmat rules over vital power: it is of him he asks vital power for these (the Sacrificer's family).  'Thou, Agni, causest vital powers to flow: (send us food and drink, and keep calamity. far from us),' serves as invitatory formula.
8	4	9	He then offers, with , 'Long-lived be thou, O Agni, growing by offering, ghee-mouthed, ghee-born: drinking the sweet, pleasant cow's ghee, guard thou these, as a father does his son, hail!' he thus says this so that he (Agni) may guard and protect these (men).
8	4	10	The sacrificial fee for this (ceremony) consists of an old ox, old barley, an old arm-chair with head-cushion--this at least is the prescribed Dakshinâ, but he may give more according to his inclination. Such, indeed, (is the performance) in the case of one who had built a fire-altar.
8	4	11	And in the case of one who has not built a fire-altar, there is the same mode of selecting the site (for the sepulchral mound) and the same performance save that of the fire-altar. 'Let him use pebbles (instead of bricks ) in the case of one who keeps up a sacrificial fire,' say some, 'they are just what those pebbles used at the Agnyâdheya are .' 'Let him not use them,' say others; 'surely they would be liable to weigh heavily upon one who has not built a fire-altar.' Let him do as he pleases.
8	4	12	Having fetched a clod from the boundary, he  deposits it (midway) between (the grave and the village), with , 'This I put up as a bulwark for the living, lest another of them should go unto that thing: may they live for a hundred plentiful harvests, and shut out death from themselves by a mountain!'--he thus makes this a boundary between the Fathers and the living, so as not to commingle; and therefore, indeed, the living and the Fathers are not seen together here.
