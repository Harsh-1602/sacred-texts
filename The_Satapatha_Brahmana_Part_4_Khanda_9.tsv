1	2	1	He then sprinkles him (Agni-Rudra, the fire-altar). For the gods, having now appeased him by the Satarudriya, thereby appeased him still further; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), now that he has appeased him by the Satarudriya, still further appease him thereby.
1	2	2	With water he sprinkles him ,--water is a means of appeasing (soothing): he thus appeases him thereby. He sprinkles him all over; he thus appeases him all over. Thrice he sprinkles,--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus appeases him.
1	2	3	And, again, as to why he sprinkles him,--that Agni (the fire-altar), doubtless, is these worlds: by water he thus encompasses these worlds, by the ocean, indeed, he encompasses them. On every side (he sprinkles the altar): hence the ocean flows round these worlds on every side. From left to right (he sprinkles): hence the ocean flows round these worlds from left to right.
1	2	4	For safety from injury it is the Agnîdh who sprinkles, for the Agnîdh is the same as Agni, and no one injures his own self. From a stone (he sprinkles), for from the rock water springs forth;--from the arm-pit, for from the arm-pit water springs forth; from the right arm-pit , for from the right arm-pit water springs forth.
1	2	5	, 'The food that is lying in the rock, in the mountain,'--for that food, water, is indeed contained in the rock, in the mountains;--'the drink that is gathered from waters, plants and trees,'--for from all that that drink is indeed gathered;--'that sap and food bring ye unto us, O Maruts, as bountiful givers!'--for the Maruts are the rulers of the rain. With 'In the rock is thy hunger,' he (after watering the altar) sets down (the pitcher on the stone): he thus lays hunger into the stone, whence the stone is not fit for eating. But hard also is the stone, and hard is hunger: he thus puts the hard along with the hard. With, 'In me thy food!' he takes up (the pitcher): he thereby takes up the food into his own self. Thus (he does) a second and a third time.
1	2	6	Having (finally) set down the pitcher, he perambulates thrice (the altar); for when (in sprinkling) he walks all round it, he, as it were, makes light of him (Agni-Rudra). He now makes amends to him, for (his own) safety.
1	2	7	And, again, as to why he perambulates it,--he then (in sprinkling the altar) goes after him  (Agni-Rudra): thereupon he now recovers his own self unto life, and so does he by that self of his obtain all vital power.
1	2	8	Thrice he perambulates it, for thrice he walks round it (whilst sprinkling): thus as many times as he walks round it, so many times does he perambulate it.
1	2	9	Having thereupon put that stone into the water-pitcher, they throw it in that (south-western) direction, for that is Nirriti's region: he thus consigns pain  to Nirriti's region.
1	2	10	For at that time, the gods, having appeased him by the Satarudriya and the water, thereby drove out his pain, his evil; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now, after appeasing him by the Satarudriya and the water, cast away his pain, his evil.
1	2	11	Outside the fire-altar he throws it; for this fire-altar indeed is the same as these (three) worlds: he thus puts pain outside these worlds;--outside the sacrificial ground (vedi); for the Vedi is this (earth): he thus puts pain outside this earth.
1	2	12	Whilst standing at the right thigh of the Vedi, with his face to the east, he throws it southwards, with, 'Let thy pain enter him whom we hate!' and thus its pain enters whomsoever he hates. He may say, 'Let thy pain enter so-and-so!' naming him whom he hates, and then he has no longer any hold upon him; but let him take no notice of this, for indicated of himself is he whom he who knows this hates. If it  should remain unbroken, let him bid (the Pratiprasthâtri) to break it; for only when it is broken, the pain enters him whom he hates. They return (to the altar) without looking back: they thus leave pain and evil behind without looking back to them.
1	2	13	Having returned, he makes the bricks his ownmilch cows; for the gods, having now appeased him (Agni-Rudra) by the Satarudriya and the water, and having driven out his pain and evil, returned (to the altar) and made the bricks their own milch cows; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now, after appeasing him by the Satarudriya and the water, and casting off his pain and evil, return and make the bricks his own milch cows.
1	2	14	And some say, 'Let him make them his own whilst sitting, for sitting one milks the cow.' But let him rather make them his own standing; for that fire-altar is these worlds, and these worlds are, as it were, standing. And, moreover, one is stronger whilst standing.
1	2	15	, whilst standing (near the right thigh of the altar) with his face towards the north-east; in front stands that cow by the Sacrificer with her face towards the west (back), for from the right side they approach the cow which stands with its face towards the back (west).
1	2	16	And wherever he reaches (whilst stretching his arms over the altar), there he touches it and mutters this formula , 'Let these bricks be mine own milch cows, O Agni!' for Agni rules over this making of cows, whence he addresses Agni out of so many deities;--'One, and ten  . . . . and a hundred thousand millions, and a billion;'--for the one, to wit, one and ten, is the lowest quantity, and the other, to wit, a hundred thousand millions, and a billion, is the highest quantity; thus, having comprehended them by thelowest and the highest quantity, the gods made them their own milch cows; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), having thus comprehended them by the lowest and the highest quantity, make them his own milch cows. Hence also he need not care to make many (cows) his own , for in yonder world that (Sacrificer), by means of the Brahman (holy writ), the Yagus, will make many (cows) his own. And in that he carries on (the numbers) uninterruptedly, thereby he carries on, without interruption, his objects of desire.
1	2	17	And as to why he makes the bricks his own milch cows,--this fire-altar is speech, for with speech it is built up; and when he says, 'One, and ten, . . . and a hundred thousand millions, and a billion,'--'one' is speech, and a hundred thousand millions is speech, and a billion is speech: it is Speech herself that the gods thereby made their own milch cow; and in like manner does the Sacrificer thereby make Speech herself his own milch cow. And in that he carries on (the numbers) uninterruptedly, thereby it is Speech herself that he carries on:--'Let these bricks be mine own milch cows, O Agni, hereafter in yonder world!' He thereby makes them his own milch cows in this world, and he also makes them his own milch cows in yonder world; and thus they are profitable to him in both worlds, in this one and in the other.
1	2	18	, 'The seasons ye are,'--for these (bricks) are indeed the seasons;--'law-sustaining,' that is, 'truth-sustaining;'--'be ye season-abiding, law-sustaining!--for the bricksare the days and nights, and the days and nights indeed abide in the seasons;--'fat-showering, honey-showering,'--he thereby makes them fat-showering and honey-showering for himself.
1	2	19	'The widely-shining by name,'--for the gods then called those bricks to them by their names, and in the same way in which they called them, they turned unto them; but the 'space-fillers' alone stood with averted faces discharging water, having no names applied to them. They called them by the name 'the widely-shining,' and they turned unto them. Hence, each time he has laid down ten bricks, he addresses them with the 'space-filling  (verse)': he thereby makes them widely-shining (virâg), for the Virâg (metre) consists of ten syllables:--'wish-milking, never-failing,'--he thereby makes them wish-milking and never-failing.
1	2	20	He then draws a frog, a lotus-flower, and a bamboo-shoot across (the central part of the altar). For the gods having now appeased him by the Satarudriya and the water, and having driven out his pain and evil, thereby still further appeased him; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), now that he has appeased him by the Satarudriya and the water, and driven out his pain and evil, still further appease him thereby. In every direction he draws them: he thus appeases him everywhere.
1	2	21	And, again, as to why he draws them across. Now, in the beginning, when the Rishis, the vital airs, made up that Agni , they sprinkled him with water: that water dripped off and became the frogs.
1	2	22	They (the waters) said to Pragâpati, 'Whatever moisture  we had, has gone down.' He said, 'This tree shall know it!'--he shall know (vettu), he shall taste it (sam vettu)--that one, indeed, they mystically call 'vetasa' (bamboo), for the gods love the mystic. And because they said, 'Down (avâk) has gone our moisture (ka),' they became avâkkâs;--'avâkkâs,' they mystically call 'avakâs (lotuses),' for the gods love the mystic. These, then, are those three kinds of water, to wit, the frog, the lotus-flower, and the bamboo-shoot: by means of these three kinds of water he appeases him.
1	2	23	And, again, why he draws them across it;--when he (Agni, the fire-altar) is built up, he is being born, and he is born for every kind of food; and these are every kind of food, to wit, the frog, the lotus-flower, and the bamboo-shoot, for these, indeed, are animals, water, and trees: with all this food he gratifies him.
1	2	24	With the frog, on the part of animals, whence, of animals, the frog is the one affording least subsistence, for he is used up;--with the lotus-flower, on the part of water, whence of the kinds of water (plants), lotus-flowers are those affording least subsistence, for they are used up;--and with the bamboo-shoot, on the part of trees; whence, of trees, the bamboo is the one affording least subsistence, for it is used up.
1	2	25	Having tied them to a cane, he, in the first place, draws them eastwards along the right (south) part of the (body of the) altar inside the enclosing-stones,with , 'With the lotus-flower of the ocean we encompass thee, O Agni: be thou bright and propitious unto us!' that is, 'With the waters of the ocean we appease thee.'
1	2	26	Then northwards along the hind part (of the altar), with , 'With an outer vesture of cold we encompass thee, O Agni: be thou bright and propitious unto us!'--that part of the cold which is frozen hard is an outer vesture of cold: thus, 'By the frozen part of cold we appease thee!'
1	2	27	Then eastwards along the left (north) part, with , 'Upon the earth, into the reed, into the rivers descend thou, O Agni, thou art the bile  of waters: with them, come thou, O she-frog, and make the sacrifice bright-coloured and propitious for us!' as the text, so the meaning.
1	2	28	Then southwards along the forepart, with , 'Thou art the receptacle of waters, the abode of the ocean: let thy darts burn others than us! unto us be thou bright and propitious!' as the text, so the meaning. He first draws them thus , then thus, then thus, then thus: that is from left to right, for so it is with the gods.
1	2	29	Over the body (of the altar) he draws themfirst, for of (the bird, or Agni) that is born the body is born first, then the right wing, then the tail, then the left wing: that is from left to right, for so it is with the gods.
1	2	30	Over the wings and tail he draws them in the direction of the body (self): he thus lays calmness into his own self;--from the further end (he draws) hitherwards: he thus lays calmness into his own self from the further end hitherwards. The right wing, with , 'O bright Agni, with thy light, (with thy dainty tongue, O god, bring hither the gods, and worship them)!' The tail, with , 'O bright and shining Agni, (bring hither the gods to our sacrifice and our offering)!' The left wing, with , 'He who with bright and glittering light (shineth upon the earth, as the dawns with their glow, who, the ever young, speeding, as in the race, in the battle, of the steed, thirsteth not in the heat).' 'Bright,' he says each time, for whatever is kindly and propitious is bright: he thus propitiates him thereby.
1	2	31	With seven (formulas) he draws them across,--the altar consists of seven layers, and seven seasons are a year, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus crosses him. Having thrown the cane on the heap of rubbish;--
1	2	32	then sings hymns round it (the altar);--for therein that whole Agni is completed; and the gods laid into him that highest form, immortality; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) thereby lay into him that highest form, immortality. Sâman-hymns are (used), for sâmans are vital airs,and the vital airs are immortality: immortality, that highest form, he thus lays into him. On every side he sings around it: everywhere he thus lays immortality, that highest form, into him.
1	2	33	And, again, as to why he sings sâman-hymns round about it;--the gods then desired, 'Let us make this body of ours boneless and immortal.' They spake, 'Think ye upon this, how we may make this body of ours boneless and immortal!' They spake, 'Meditate (kit) ye!' whereby indeed they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer (kiti)! seek ye how we may make this body of ours boneless and immortal!
1	2	34	Whilst meditating, they saw those sâman-hymns, and sang them round about it, and by means of them they made that body of theirs boneless and immortal; and in like manner does the Sacrificer, when he sings the sâman-hymns round about it, make that body of his boneless and immortal. On every side he sings: everywhere he thus makes that body of his boneless and immortal. Standing he sings, for these worlds stand, as it were; and whilst standing one doubtless is stronger. He sings, after uttering (the syllable) 'him,' for therein the sâman-hymn becomes whole and complete.
1	2	35	He first sings the Gâyatra hymn , for the Gâyatrî metre is Agni: he thus makes Agni hishead, and that head of his (or of him, Agni) he thus makes boneless and immortal.
1	2	36	The Rathantara  (hymn he sings) at the right wing; for the Rathantara is this (earth), and this (earth), doubtless, is the most essential (rasatama) of these worlds, for it is in her that all these essences (rasa) are contained, and 'rasantama,' indeed, they call mystically, 'rathantara,' for the gods love the mystic: he thus makes this (earth) his right wing, and that right wing of his he thus makes boneless and immortal.
1	2	37	The Brihat  (hymn he sings) at the left wing; the Brihat (great), doubtless, is the sky, for the sky is the greatest (of worlds): he thus makes the sky his (Agni's) left wing, and that left wing of his he thus makes boneless and immortal.
1	2	38	The Vâmadevya  (hymn he sings) on the body (of the altar); for the Vâmadevya is the breath, and the breath is air (vâyu, the wind), and he, Vâyu, doubtless, is the self (body) of all the gods: he thus makes the air (wind) his body, and that body of his he thus makes boneless and immortal.
1	2	39	The Yagñâyagñiya  (hymn he sings) near the tail;--the Yagñâyagñiya, doubtless, is the moon; for whenever a sacrifice becomes completed , the essence of its oblations goes up to him (the moon);and inasmuch as sacrifice after sacrifice (yagña) goes up to him, the moon is the Yagñâyagñiya: he thus makes the moon his (Agni's) tail, and that tail of his he thus makes boneless and immortal.
1	2	40	He then sings the heart of Pragâpati ;--the heart assuredly is yonder sun, for he (the sun) is smooth, and the heart is smooth; he is round, and the heart is round. On the body (of the altar) he sings, for the heart is in the body;--at the armpit , for the heart is in (the vicinity of) the armpit;--at the right armpit, for the heart is nearer thereto : he thus makes the sun his (Agni's) heart, and that heart of his he thus makes boneless and immortal.
1	2	41	He sings about offspring (pragâ) and Pragâpati (the lord of creatures and procreation);--when he sings about offspring, he lays the heart into offspring; and when he sings about Pragâpati, he lays the heart into Agni.
1	2	42	And, again, as to why he sings about offspring and Pragâpati;--this Agni, doubtless, is both offspring and the lord of offspring, and hence, when he sings about Agni, he lays the heart both into the offspring and into the lord of offspring.
1	2	43	These (hymns) are the immortal bricks; he lays them down last (highest) of all:--he thereby makes immortality the highest thing of all this (universe), and hence immortality is the highest thing of all this (universe). Let none other but the Adhvaryu  sing; for these (hymns) are bricks, and he (Agni, the fire-altar) would be built up in the wrong way , were any other than the Adhvaryu to sing.
2	1	1	On the day of preparation, early in the morning, when the sun has risen, he releases his speech. Having released his speech, he takes clarified butter, in five ladlings, and throws five chips of gold thereon. Then these three (materials), sour curds, honey and ghee, are poured together, either into a dish, or a pot with a wide mouth; and he puts a handful of sacrificial grass thereon.
2	1	2	He then mounts the fire-altar, with (Vâg. S. XVII, II), 'Homage be to thy heat, thy fire ! homage be to thy flame!'--for that Agni has now been completely restored, and he now is equal to injuring whomever he might wish to injure; and whomever he injures, he injures either by his heat, or by his fire, or by his flame; in this way he does not injure him thereby (etaih);--'Let thy darts burn others than us! unto us be thou bright and propitious!' as the text, so the sense.
2	1	3	Having mounted the altar, he makes the libation of fivefold-taken ghee on the naturally-perforated (brick): the significance of this has been explained .
2	1	4	On the naturally-perforated (brick) he makes the libation--the naturally-perforated one is the breath: into (the channel of) the breath he thus puts food.
2	1	5	And, again, as to why he offers on the naturally-perforated one;--this (brick) is an uttara-vedi (high-altar) of Agni (the fire-altar); and that former libation which he makes  belongs to the Soma-sacrifice, but this one belongs to the fire-altar; this he now offers.
2	1	6	On that (former) occasion he makes the libation whilst looking at the gold; for distinct is what one sees, and distinct was that high-altar; and thrown down , indeed, are (the gold chips) on this occasion, and indistinct is what is thrown down, and indistinct is this high-altar.
2	1	7	With the Svâhâ-call he makes the libation on that (high-altar), for distinct (manifest) is the Svâhâ, and distinct is that high-altar; but with the Vet-call (he offers) on this (brick), for indistinct is the Vet-call, and indistinct is this high-altar. With ghee (they offer), for with ghee they offer on the high-altar;--with fivefold-taken (ghee), for with fivefold-taken (ghee) they offer on the high-altar:--by turns (he makes the libations), for by turns  they make the libations on the high-altar.
2	1	8	, 'To the man-seated, vet!'--the man-seated one, doubtless, is the breath, and men mean human beings: he thereby gratifies that fire (or Agni), the breath, which is in human beings;--'To the water-seated, vet!--he thereby gratifies the fire which is in the waters;--'To the barhis-seated, vet!' hethereby gratifies the fire which is in plants ;--'To the wood-seated, vet!'--he thereby gratifies the fire which is in trees;--'To the heaven-winning, vet!'--the heaven-winning one is this Agni (kitya): it is this Agni he thereby gratifies.
2	1	9	And as to why he says, 'To the man-seated, vet! To the water-seated, vet!' &c., these are names of this Agni: these names he thereby pleases. By means of the oblation he makes them a deity: for whatever deity the oblation is prepared, that deity (they are), not that deity for whom it is not prepared. And, in calling them by their names, he also thereby places those fires along with this fire.
2	1	10	These are five oblations he offers,--the fire-altar consists of five layers, the year of five seasons, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much food he thus gratifies him.
2	1	11	He then sprinkles him (Agni, the fire-altar) with the sour curds, honey and ghee; when he is built up, he is born, and he is born for every (kind of) food; and these, to wit, sour curds, honey and ghee, are every (kind of) food: with every (kind of) food he thus gratifies him. Everywhere (he sprinkles the altar): everywhere he thus gratifies him with every (kind of) food.
2	1	12	And, again, as to why he sprinkles him;--here that Agni has been built up complete: on him the gods now bestowed the highest (or last) form; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now bestow on him the highest (or last) form; but form meansfood, and these, to wit, sour curds, honey and ghee, are the most excellent kind of food: this, the most excellent form he thus bestows upon him as his highest (property). Everywhere he sprinkles, even outside the enclosing-stones; everywhere he thus bestows on him the highest form;--by means of sacrificial grass-stalks (he sprinkles), for they are pure and meet for sacrifice; by means of their tops (he sprinkles), for the top (is sacred) to the gods.
2	1	13	And, again, as to why he sprinkles them;--of old, when the Rishis, the vital airs, joined him together, they made that 'sagûrabdîya' (oblation)  his special fore-share, and, when he had been built up, they made this (sprinkling) his after-share: thus, in sprinkling him, he gratifies those Rishis, the vital airs, who, when he (Agni) had been built up, made this his after-share. With sour curds, honey and ghee (he sprinkles): the significance of this has been explained.
2	1	14	, 'The gods of the gods, the worshipful of the worshipful,'--for they (the vital airs) are indeed the gods of (among) the gods, and the worshipful of the worshipful';--'who draw nigh unto the yearlong share,' for they do indeed draw near to this their year-long share;--'not eaters of oblations,--at this offering of sacrificial food,'--for the vital airs, indeed, are not eaters of oblations;--'may themselves drink of the honey and the ghee!'that is, 'should themselves drink of this honey and ghee.'
2	1	15	'The gods who attained godhead over the gods,'--for these gods have indeed attained a divine state over the gods; 'who are the forerunners of this holy work,'--the holy work is this fire-altar (and sacrifice), and they are the forerunners thereof;--'without whom no dwelling-place becometh pure;' for without the vital airs no dwelling-place becomes pure ;--'they are not on the backs of the sky and the earth,'--that is, 'they are neither in the sky nor on earth: whatever breathes therein they are.'
2	1	16	With two (verses) he sprinkles, two-footed is the Sacrificer, and the Sacrificer is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus sprinkles him.
2	1	17	He then descends again (from the altar), with , 'Givers of in-breathing, givers of off-breathing,'--for this Agni who has been built up is all these breathings; were he not to utter at this time this (declaration of) self-surrender, then that (Agni) would possess himself of those breathings of his (the Sacrificer's); but now that he gives utterance to this self-surrender, that (Agni) does not possess himself of those breathings of his;--'Givers of in-breathing, givers of off-breathing, givers of through-breathing, givers of lustre, givers of room,'--he thereby says, 'A giver of this thou art to me,'--'let thy darts burnothers than us! unto us be thou bright and propitious!'--as the text, so the meaning.
2	1	18	Having returned (to the hall-fire) he proceeds with the (forenoon performance of the) Pravargya  and Upasad ; and having performed the Pravargya and Upasad, he hands to him (the Sacrificer) the fast-food or semi-fast-food. He then (proceeds) with the (afternoon performance of the) Pravargya and Upasad, and having obtained the object for which he puts the (Pravargya-) cauldron on the fire, he sets out (the apparatus of) the Pravargya.
2	1	19	Let him set it out on an island; for, when heated, that (cauldron) is suffering pain; and were he to set it out on this (earth) its pain would enter this (earth); and were he to set it out on water, its pain would enter the water; but when he sets it out on an island, then it does not injure either the water or this (earth): in that he does not throw it into the water, it does not injure the water; and in that the water goes all round it--water being a means of soothing--it does not injure this earth;--let him therefore set it out on an island.
2	1	20	But let him rather set it out on the fire-altar;--for that fire-altar is these worlds, and the enclosing-stones are the waters;--so that when he sets it out on the fire-altar, he indeed sets it out on an island.
2	1	21	And, again, as to why he sets it out on the fire-altar;--that fire-altar is these worlds, and those Pravargya (vessels) are Agni (fire), Vâyu (wind), and Âditya (sun): hence, were he to set them out in any other place than the fire-altar, he would place those gods outside these worlds; but in that he sets themout on the fire-altar, he places those gods in these worlds.
2	1	22	And, again, as to why he sets it out on the fire-altar,--the Pravargya is the head of the sacrifice, and this built-up fire-altar is the body: hence were he to set it out in any other place than the fire-altar, he would place that head away from that (body), but in that he sets it out on the fire-altar, he, having put together that body of him (Agni), restores the head to it.
2	1	23	The first Pravargya (vessel) he sets out close to the naturally-perforated (brick);--the naturally-perforated one is the breath, and the Pravargya is the head, and this built-up Agni is the body: he thus connects and puts together the head and the body by means of (the channel of) the breath. Having set out the Pravargya as is the way of its setting out,--
2	2	1	Having returned to the (Gârhapatya ) in order to take forward the fire, he offers oblations, and puts on pieces of firewood. For now that Agni was about to go forward (to the fire-altar), the gods regaled him with food, both with oblations and pieces of firewood; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), now that he (Agni) is about to go forward, regale him with food, both with oblations and pieces of firewood. He takes (ghee) in five ladlings: the meaning of this has been explained.
2	2	2	He then takes (ghee) in sixteen ladlings ,--Pragâpati consists of sixteen parts, and Pragâpati is Agni: he thus regales him with food proportionate to his body; and the food which is proportionate to the body satisfies and does no injury; but that which is excessive does injury, and that which is too little does not satisfy. He takes (the oblations) in the same offering-ladle, for one and the same (Agni) is he whom he regales therewith. With two (verses) addressed to Visvakarman he offers; for this Agni is Visvakarman (the all-worker): it is him he thereby gratifies. Three oblations he offers,--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much food he thus regales him.
2	2	3	He then puts on the pieces of firewood: this is as if, after regaling some one, one were to attend upon him. They are of udumbara (ficus glomerata) wood; for the Udumbara is food and sap: with food and sap he thus regales him. They are fresh (green), for that part of trees which is fresh is uninjured and living: he thus regales him with what is uninjured and living in trees. They are soaked in ghee; for ghee is sacred to Agni: with his own portion, with his own sap he thus regales him. They remain the whole night in it, for there they become imbued with sap. Three pieces of wood he puts on,--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much food he thus regales him.
2	2	4	And; again, as to why he offers those oblations;--now that he (Agni) was about to go forward,the gods restored (recruited) him beforehand with food, with these oblations; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), now that he (Agni) is about to go forward, restore him beforehand with food, with these oblations.
2	2	5	He takes (ghee) in five ladlings, for fivefold divided is that vital air in the head,--the mind, speech, the breath, the eye, and the ear,--he thus lays that fivefold divided vital air into this head. , 'Agni, with sharp flame, (may destroy every demon! Agni gaineth wealth for us)' thus with a (verse) containing (the word) 'sharp': he therewith sharpens his head so as to become sharp.
2	2	6	He then takes (ghee) in sixteen ladlings: eight vital airs, and eight limbs ,--this (the symbolical) amount. He takes it in the same spoon, for, indeed, the vital airs and the limbs are in the same body. Separately  he offers: he thereby makes a distinction between the vital airs and the limbs. With two (verses) addressed to Visvakarman he offers: Visvakarman is this Agni, it is him he thus puts together. Three oblations he offers,--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much food he thus restores him. With seventeen verses (he offers) ,--Pragâpati is seventeenfold, and Pragâpati is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus restores him. With (ghee) taken in twenty-one ladlings (he offers the two oblations),--there are twelve months, five seasons, these three worlds, and yonder sun as the twenty-first: this is the (symbolical) amount (or, correspondence).
2	2	7	And, again, as to why he puts the pieces of firewood on; the gods having set him up wholly and completely, now regaled him with this food, these pieces of firewood; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), now that he has set him up wholly and completely, regale him with this food, these pieces of firewood. They are of udumbara wood, and fresh, and remain for a whole night (being) soaked in ghee: the significance of this has been explained. , 'Upwards lead thou him, O Agni! . . . Forward lead thou him, O Indra! . . . In whose house we make offering . . .,' as the text, so the meaning. Three pieces of firewood he puts on,--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much food he thus regales him. Three oblations he offers,--that makes six: the significance of this has been explained.
2	3	1	He (the Adhvaryu) then gives orders (to his assistant, the Pratiprasthâtri); 'Lift the log ! hold up the underlayer!'--, 'Recite for Agni as he is taken forward!'--'Agnîdh, follow up with the single sword (-line)!'--'Brahman, mutter the Apratiratha (hymn)!'
2	3	2	For at that time, as the gods were about to come up in order to perform this sacrifice, the Asuras, the mischievous fiends, tried to smite them from the south, saying, 'Ye shall not sacrifice! ye shall not perform the sacrifice!'
2	3	3	The gods said to Indra, 'Thou art the highest and mightiest, and strongest of us: do thou hold those fiends in check!'--'Let the Brahman (n.) be my ally!' he said.--'So be it!' They made Brihaspati his ally, for Brihaspati is the Brahman (the priesthood); and having had the Asuras, the mischievous fiends, chased away in the south by Brihaspati and Indra, they spread this sacrifice in a place free from danger and devilry.
2	3	4	Now what the gods did then, that is done on this occasion. Those fiends, it is true, have now been chased away by the gods themselves, but when he does this, he does so thinking, 'I will do what the gods did;' and having had the Asuras, the mischievous fiends, chased away in the south by Indra and Brihaspati, he performs this sacrifice in a place free from danger and devilry.
2	3	5	As to that Indra, he is that Apratiratha (irresistible hymn); and as to that Brihaspati, he is the Brahman (priest) thus, when the Brahman mutters the Apratiratha (hymn) he (the Sacrificer), having the Asuras, the mischievous fiends, chased away in the south, by Indra and Brihaspati, performs this sacrifice in a place free from danger and devilry. This is why the Brahman mutters the Apratiratha .
2	3	6	'The swift (Indra), sharpening (his weapon), like a terrible bull,'--these are twelve suitable (verses) relating to Indra,--a year consists of twelve months, and Agni (the fire-altar) is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he drives off the Asuras, the mischievous fiends, in the south. With trishtubh  (verses he does so),--the Trishtubh is the thunderbolt: by the thunderbolt he thus drives off the Asuras, the mischievous fiends, in the south. They amount to twenty-two Gâyatrîs , and thus they relate to Agni, for this is Agni's performance.
2	3	7	He then takes him up (in the form of a burning piece of firewood), with , 'Upwards may the All-gods bear thee, O Agni, by their thoughts! . . .' the meaning of this has been explained .
2	3	8	They then go forward, with , 'May the divine regions, the goddesses, protect the sacrifice!'--The gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pragâpati, were contending for the regions, and the gods wrested the regions from the Asuras; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now wrest the regions from his hateful rival. 'Divine' he says, and thereby makes them divine for himself;--'may the goddesses protect the sacrifice,' that is, 'may the goddesses protect this sacrifice!'--'keeping off want and ill-will,'--want is hunger: thus, 'keeping off hunger;'--'grantingto the lord of the sacrifice a share in wealth-affluence,' that is, 'granting to the lord of the sacrifice a share in wealth and in affluence;' 'may the sacrifice be founded on wealth-affluence!'--that is, 'may the sacrifice be founded on wealth and affluence!'
2	3	9	'Glorifying on the kindled fire,'--the glorifying one is the Sacrificer;--'the hymn-winged,'--for hymns are his wings;--'taken,'--that is, 'held;'--'praiseworthy,'--that is, 'worthy of worship;'--'(when) they sacrificed, encircling the heated cauldron,'--for they did sacrifice, whilst encircling the heated (Pravargya) cauldron; 'when the gods offered the sacrifice with food,'--for the gods did offer this sacrifice with food.
2	3	10	'To the divine, fostering upholder,'--for he, Agni, is the divine upholder, the most fostering;--'he, the approacher of gods, the well-disposed, of a hundred draughts,'--for he is indeed an approacher of the gods, and well-disposed, and possessed of a hundred draughts;--'encircling, the gods drew nigh unto the sacrifice,'--for encircling him (Agni), the gods drew nigh to the sacrifice;--'the gods stood ready to perform the cult unto the gods,'--the cult, doubtless, is the sacrifice, thus, 'the gods stood ready to perform the sacrifice to the gods.'
2	3	11	'The welcome oblation slaughtered by the slaughterer  to sacrifice;'--that is, 'wished-for, much wished-for;'--'where the fourth sacrifice goeth to the offering,'--the Adhvaryu first mutters the formulas, the Hotri afterwards recitesthe verses, the Brahman mutters the Apratiratha (hymn) on the south side; this (set of verses), then, is the fourth sacrifice;--'may the prayers, the blessings favour us !'--that is, 'may both prayers and blessings favour us!'
2	3	12	'The sun-rayed, golden-haired Savitri ever lifted up  the light in front,'--this Agni, doubtless, is yonder sun, and that sun-rayed, golden-haired Savitri in front ever lifts up that light;--'at his behest Pûshan goeth, the wise,'--Pûshan, doubtless, means cattle, and they indeed start forth at his (Agni-Sûrya's) behest;--'viewing all beings as their guardian,'--for he indeed views everything here, and he is the protector of all this world.
2	3	13	Now, the gods thereby (viz. by these five verses) wrested from the Asuras the five regions which are on this side of yonder sun, and then ascended them; and so does the Sacrificer now wrest them from his hateful rival, and then ascend them. And by means of them the gods reached this place, and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) by means of them reach this place .
2	3	14	He then sets up a variegated stone;--thevariegated stone, doubtless, is yonder sun: it is thus yonder sun that is set up. It is variegated, for by means of its rays that disk is variegated. He sets it up between the Âhavanîya and the Gârhapatya; for the Gârhapatya is this (terrestrial) world, and the Âhavanîya is the sky: he thus places him (the sun) between these two worlds, whence he shines between these two worlds.
2	3	15	On the Âgnîdhra range  (he places it), for the Âgnîdhra's fire-shed is the air; he thus places it in the air, whence that (sun) has the air for his seat. Halfway (between the two fires he places it); for that (sun) is halfway from this (earth).
2	3	16	This (stone) is the breath,--he thus puts the breath into the body; and it is the vital power,--he thus puts vital power into the body; it is food, for it is vital power, and vital power is indeed food. It is a stone, for a stone is firm: he thus makes the vital power firm. It is variegated, for food is variegated (varied).
2	3	17	He sets it up , 'Measuring he keeps in the middle of the sky,'--for that (sun) indeed keeps measuring in the middle of the sky;--'filling the two worlds and the air,' for even in rising he fills these (three) worlds, 'he scans the all-reaching, the butter-reaching,'--he thereby means the offering-ladles and the offering-grounds;--'between the front and back lights,'--that is, between this world and that one; or that (fire-altar) which is here at this moment being built, and that which was there built at first.
2	3	18	'The showering ocean, the ruddy bird,'--for he (the sun) is indeed a showering ocean, and a ruddy bird,--'hath entered the seat of his easterly father,'--for he indeed enters that seat of his easterly  father;--'the many-hued rock set up in the middle of the sky,'--for that variegated stone is indeed set up in the middle of the sky;--'hath traversed and guardeth the two ends of the atmosphere;'--for in traversing he guards the ends of these worlds.
2	3	19	With two (verses) he sets it up;--two-footed is the Sacrificer, and the Sacrificer is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus sets him (the sun, Agni) up. With trishtubh (verses he sets him up),--for that (sun) is related to the Trishtubh. He does not 'settle' (the stone), for unsettled is that (sun); nor does he pronounce the Sûdadohas over it;--the Sûdadohas means the breath, and that (sun) is the breath, and why should he put breath into (or on) the breath? Having deposited it in such a way that it is not lost;--
2	3	20	They now approach , They all have magnified Indra,'--the meaning of this has been explained . 'Let the god-invoking sacrifice lead hither, let the favour-invoking sacrifice lead hither (the gods)!'--both god-invoking and favour-invoking indeed is the sacrifice; 'let Agni, the god, make offering and lead hither the gods!' that is, 'may Agni, the god, both make offering and bring hither the gods!'
2	3	21	'The creation of strength hath upheaved me with upheaval, and Indra hath laid low mine enemies by subdual,'--as the text, so the meaning.
2	3	22	'May the gods advance the Brahman both by upheaval and subdual; and may Indra and Agni scatter asunder mine enemies!'--as the text, so the meaning.
2	3	23	Now, the gods thereby (viz. by these four verses) wrested from the Asuras the four regions which are above yonder sun, and then ascended them; and in like manner does the Sacrificer thereby wrest them from his hateful enemy, and then ascend them. And by means of them the gods then attained to that place; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) by means of them attain thither.
2	3	24	They then mount the fire-altar, with , 'By Agni ascend ye to the firmament!'--the firmament, doubtless, is the heavenly world: thus, 'by means of this Agni (fire-altar) ascend ye to that heavenly world!'--'holding the Ukhya in your hands,'--for the Ukhya (the fire in the pan) they do hold in their hands ;--'having gone to the back of the sky, to heaven, keep ye mingling with the gods!'--that is, 'having gone to the back of the sky, to the heavenly world, keep ye mingling with the gods!'
2	3	25	'Go thou forth to the eastern quarter, knowing!'--the eastern quarter, doubtless, is Agni's: thus, 'To thine own quarter go thou forth, knowing!'--'be thou Agni's fore-fire here, O Agni!'--that is, 'Of this Agni (kitya) be thou, O Agni, the fore-fire !'--'Shine thou, illumining all regions!'--that is, 'shine thou, illuminating every region!'--'Grant thou food to our two-footed and four-footed one!' he thereby invokes a blessing.
2	3	26	'From the earth have I ascended the air; from the air have I ascended the sky;'--for from the Gârhapatya they go to the Âgnîdhrîya, and from the Âgnîdhrîya to the Âhavanîya;--'from the sky, the back of the firmament, have I gone to heaven, to the light;'--that is, 'from the sky, the back of the firmament, have I gone to the heavenly world.'
2	3	27	'The heaven-going look not round, they ascend the heaven, the two worlds,'--those who go to the heavenly world do not indeed look round  ; 'the wise who performed the all-sustaining sacrifice,'--for that sacrifice is indeed all-sustaining , and they who perform it are indeed wise.
2	3	28	'Go forward, Agni, first of the godward-going,'--he thereby says to this Agni (that is carried forward), 'Go thou forward, as the first of these godward-going ones; the eye of the godsand of mortals,'--for this (Agni) is indeed the eye of both gods and men;--'they who love to sacrifice together with the Bhrigus,'--that is, 'sacrificing together with the Bhrigus,'--'let the offerers go unto heaven, hail!'--that is, 'may the offerers go to the heavenly world, hail!'
2	3	29	Now, the gods thereby (viz. by these five verses) wrested from the Asuras the five regions which are in yonder world, and then ascended them; and so does the Sacrificer thereby wrest them from his hateful enemy, and then ascend them. And by means of them the gods attained thither, and so also does this (Sacrificer) by means of them attain thither.
2	3	30	He then makes offering on that (firebrand);--for now that he (Agni) had arrived the gods thereupon gratified him with food, this oblation; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), now that he (Agni) has arrived, thereupon gratify him with food, this oblation. With milk from a black (cow) which has a white calf (he makes offering); the black (cow) with a white calf is the night, and her calf is yonder sun: he thus regales him with his own share, with his own relish. On it (the firebrand, he offers) while it is held above (the naturally-perforated brick); for above (everything) is he whom he thereby gratifies. By means of the milk-pail (he offers), for with the milk-pail milk is given away.
2	3	31	And, again, as to why he makes offering upon it. That (Âhavanîya) fire is the head of the sacrifice, and milk means breath: he thus puts breath into the head. He should make the offering so that it (the milk) flows on the naturally-perforated (brick);--the naturally-perforated one is breath, and this (milk) is vital sap: he thus connects and puts together the head and the breath by means of vital sap. , 'Night and Dawn, of one mind, unlike in form,'--the meaning of this has been explained .
2	3	32	'O Agni, thousand-eyed!--through the chips of gold  Agni is indeed thousand-eyed;--hundred-headed,'--inasmuch as, at that time , he was created as the hundred-headed Rudra;--'thine are a hundred out-breathings, and a thousand through-breathings,'--his indeed are a hundred out-breathings and a thousand through-breathings who is hundred-headed and thousand-eyed;--'thou art the master of wealth,'--that is, 'thou art the master of all wealth;'--'to thee, our strength, do we give honour!'--he (Agni) is indeed the strength : it is him he thereby gratifies.
2	3	33	With two (verses) he makes offering thereon,--two-footed is the Sacrificer, and the Sacrificer is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus makes offering to him.
2	3	34	He then lays it (the firebrand) down, with , 'A well-winged bird thou art,'--for on that former occasion he, by means of the fashioning-formula, fashions him into a well-winged bird ; that well-winged bird he builds up, and having fashioned that well-winged bird, he finally sets him down;--'seat thee on the backof the earth, fill the air with thy shine, prop the sky with thy light, and uphold the quarters by thy lustre!'--for that one (Agni) indeed does all this.
2	3	35	'Receiving offering, kind-faced, in front,'--that is, 'receiving offering, kind-faced for us, in front;'--'seat thee, O Agni, aright in thine own seat!'--for this (fire-altar) is his (Agni's) own seat: thus, 'do thou rightly seat thee in it!'--'in this higher abode,'--the higher abode, doubtless, is the sky;--'sit ye down, the All-gods and the Sacrificer!'--he thus establishes the Sacrificer together with the All-gods. With two (verses) he deposits it: the significance of this has been explained,--with the Vashat-call: the significance of this (will be explained) farther on.
2	3	36	He then puts pieces of firewood thereon; for now that he (Agni) had arrived, the gods thereupon gratified him with food, both pieces of firewood and oblations; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), now that he has arrived, thereupon gratify him with food, both pieces of wood and oblations.
2	3	37	He first puts on one of samî-wood (acacia suma). For at that time, when this oblation had been offered, he (Agni) was enkindled and blazed up. The gods were afraid of him, lest he might injure them. They saw this samî tree, and therewith appeased him; and inasmuch as they appeased (sam) him by that samî, it is (called) Samî; and in like manner this (Sacrificer) now appeases him by means of that samî (wood),--just with a view to appeasement, not for food.
2	3	38	, 'I desire the manifest favour of the admirable Savitri, enjoyed by all men; that great cow of his, the thousand-streamed, teeming with milk, which Kanva was wont to milk;'--for Kanva indeed saw her, and she, the thousand-streamed, milked him all his wishes (objects of desire); and in like manner does the thousand-streamed one now milk to the Sacrificer all his objects of desire.
2	3	39	He then puts on one of vikaṅkata (flacourtia sapida) wood--the significance whereof has been explained--with , 'To thee give we honour, O Agni, in the highest home;'--his highest home, doubtless, is the sky;--'to thee give we honour, in hymns of praise, in the lower abode;'--the lower abode, doubtless, is the air;--'the birth-place whence thou hast arisen do I worship,'--that is, 'this is his (Agni's) own birth-place: that I worship;'--'on thee, when kindled, offerings are poured forth;'--for when he (the fire) is kindled, they make offerings on him.
2	3	40	He then puts on one of udumbara (ficus glomerata) wood;--the Udumbara means strength and sap: with strength and sap he thus gratifies him. It has forking branches ,--forking branches mean cattle: with cattle, as food, he thus gratifies him. If he cannot get one with bifurcate branches, let him take up a globule of sour curds and put it on (the wood): that globule of sour curds which supervenes is a form of cattle. With the virâg , 'Kindled, blaze forth, O Agni, before us, (with inexhaustible flame, O youngest! perpetual viands accrue unto thee!)'--he puts it on;--the Virâg means food: with food he thus gratifies him. Three pieces of wood he puts on,--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much food he thus gratifies him.
2	3	41	He then offers oblations,--this is just as if, after serving food to some one, one gives him something to drink. With the dipping-spoon (sruva) he offers the first two, with the offering-ladle (sruk) the last (oblation); (the first) with , 'O Agni, may we, with hymns and thoughts, speed this day this (sacrifice) of thine, even as a steed, as a noble, heart-stirring deed!'--that is, 'whatever heart-stirring hymn is thine, may I speed (perform) that for thee.' With a paṅkti (verse) he offers,--of five feet consists the Paṅkti, of five layers the fire-altar, five seasons are a year, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much food he thus gratifies him.
2	3	42	He then offers (the second oblation), the one for Visvakarman,--Visvakarman (the all-worker) is this Agni: it is him he thereby gratifies,--with , 'Thought I offer, with mind and ghee,'--that is, 'The thought of these (priests and Sacrificer) I offer with mind and ghee;'--'that the gods come hither,'--that is, 'that the gods may come hither;'--'enjoying their offering-meal, the holy-minded,'--that is, the true-minded;--'to Visvakarman, the lord of all existence, I offer,'--that is, 'to that Visvakarman who is the lord of all that here exists I offer;'--'every day theunimpaired oblation,'--that is, 'always the uninjured oblation.'
2	3	43	He then offers a full (-spoon) oblation,--the full means everything: with everything he thus gratifies him.
2	3	44	, Thine, O Agni, are seven logs,'--logs mean vital airs, for the vital airs do kindle him;--'seven tongues,'--this he says with regard to those seven persons which they made into one person ;--'seven Rishis,'--for seven Rishis they indeed were;--'seven beloved seats,'--this he says with regard to the metres, for his seven beloved seats are the metres;--'sevenfold the seven priests worship thee,'--for in a sevenfold way the seven priests indeed worship him;--'the seven homes,'--he thereby means the seven layers (of the altar);--'fill thou!'--that is, 'generate thou;'--'with ghee,'--ghee means seed: he thus lays seed into these worlds;--'svâhâ!'--the svâhâ (hail!) is the sacrifice; he thus at once makes everything here fit for sacrifice.
2	3	45	'Seven' he says each time,--of seven layers the fire-altar consists, and of seven seasons the year, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus gratifies him. Three oblations he offers,--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much food he thus gratifies him. Three logs he puts on,--that makes six: the significance of this has been explained.
2	3	46	Standing he puts on the logs,--the logs are bones, and bones stand, so to speak. Sitting heoffers the oblations,--oblations are the flesh, and the flesh sits (lies), so to speak. The logs are inside (the fire), and the oblations outside, for the bones are inside, and the flesh is outside.
2	3	47	Now, then, as to the (mystic) correspondence (or, amount). Six he offers before (the leading forward of the fire), and six afterwards; with six (formulas) they proceed up to the variegated stone; with two he lays down the variegated stone; with four they proceed as far as the fire-altar; with five they mount the fire-altar: that makes twenty-nine, and the oblation itself is the thirtieth. With two (verses) he deposits the fire,--that makes thirty-two, and of thirty-two syllables consists the Anushtubh: such, then, is this Anushtubh.
2	3	48	And this one (Anushtubh) they bring hither from those three Anushtubhs which they make up on the Gârhapatya ; and inasmuch as they bring this (therefrom) hither, thereby this whole Agni (fire-altar) becomes completed. But now he was not yet fit to eat food .
2	3	49	He said to Agni , 'By thee I will eat food!'--So be it!' Hence it is only when they bring him hither, that this (kityâgni) becomes fit to eat food, to eat oblations.
2	3	50	Moreover, they say, 'It is Pragâpati himself who takes this (Agni) as his dear son to his bosom;' and verily, whosoever so knows this, takes thus a dear son to his bosom.
2	3	51	And, again, as to why they bring it here,--the Agni (fire-altar) which is built up here is the same as those seven persons which they made into one person; and that excellence and life-sap of them which they concentrated above, that is the fire which they now bring here,--hence, when they now bring it here, they concentrate above (in the head) that excellence and life-sap which belonged to those seven persons,--that is his (Agni's) head, and this built-up fire-altar is the body: having thus completed his body, he restores the head to it.
3	1	1	He then offers the Vaisvânara (cake). That Agni has now been completely restored; he now is that deity, (Agni) Vaisvânara (belonging to all men): to him he offers this oblation, and by the oblation he makes him a deity,  whatever deity an oblation is prepared that is a deity, but not one for whom no (oblation) is prepared. It is one of twelve potsherds: twelve months are a year, and Vaisvânara is the year.
3	1	2	And, again, as to why he offers the Vaisvânara (cake),--it is as the Vaisvânara that he is about to produce that Agni: on that former occasion, at the initiation-offering , he pours him out in the form of seed: and what the seed is like that is poured.into the womb, such like (is the child that) is born; and inasmuch as there he pours out Vaisvânara in the form of seed, therefore he now is born as Vaisvânara. Silently  it is (performed) there, for there seed (is implied) in the sacrifice, and silently seed is infused; but distinctly on the present occasion, for distinct (manifest) is the seed when born.
3	1	3	Now, that Vaisvânara is all these worlds: this earth is the All (visva), and Agni is its man (nara); the air is the All, and Vâyu (the wind) is its man (ruler); the sky is the All, and Âditya (the sun) is its man.
3	1	4	And these worlds are the same as this head,--this (lower part of the head) is the earth, the plants (being) the hair of its beard: this is the All, and Agni is Speech, he is the man. That (speech) is at the top thereof, for Agni is on the top of this (earth).
3	1	5	This (central part of the face) is the air, whence it is hairless, for hairless, as it were, is the air; it is this All, and Vâyu (the wind) is the breath, he is the man; he is in the middle thereof, for the wind is in the middle of the air.
3	1	6	The sky is the (upper part of the) head, and the stars are the hair; it is the All, and Âditya (the sun) is the eye, he is the man: it is in the lower part of the (upper) head, for the sun is below the sky. Vaisvânara is the head thereof, and this built-up Agni (the altar) is the body: thus, having completed his body, he restores the head thereto.
3	1	7	He then offers the (cakes) to the Maruts;--the Maruts’ (cakes) are the vital airs: he thus puts the vital airs into him (Agni).  after offering the Vaisvânara; for the Vaisvânara is the head: he thus puts vital airs into the head.
3	1	8	That (Vaisvânara oblation) is a single one, for single, as it were, is the head; the others (viz. the Mârutas) are seven in number, of seven potsherds each; and though 'seven-seven' means 'many times,' here it is only seven : he thus places seven vital airs in the head.
3	1	9	That (Vaisvânara oblation) is (performed in a) distinct (voice), for the head is distinct; but indistinct the other (oblations), for indistinct, as it were, are the vital airs. Standing he offers the former, for the head stands, so to speak; sitting the others, for the vital airs are, so to speak, seated.
3	1	10	Now, the first two Mâruta (oblations) he offers are these two vital airs (in the ears): he offers them in the middle  of the Vaisvânara (oblations), for these two vital airs are in the middle of the head.
3	1	11	And the second pair are these two (vital airsin the eyes); he offers them closer together, for closer together, as it were, are these two vital airs.
3	1	12	And the third pair are these two (vital airs in the nostrils). He offers them closer together, for closer together, as it were, are these two vital airs. The one to be recited in the forest  is speech: it is to be recited in the forest, for by speech one gets into much terrible (trouble).
3	1	13	And, again, as to why he offers the Vaisvânara and Mârutas,--the Vaisvânara is the ruling power (chieftaincy), and the Mârutas are the clan: he thus sets up both the chief and the clan. The Vaisvânara he offers first: thus, having set up the chief, he sets up the clan.
3	1	14	The former is a single (oblation): he thus makes the ruling power (chieftaincy) to attach to a single (person), and (social) distinction to attach to a single (person). The others are numerous: he thus bestows multiplicity on the clan.
3	1	15	The former is (offered in a) distinct (voice), for the ruling power is something distinct, so to speak; and the others are indistinct, for indistinct, so to speak, is the clan. Standing he offers the former, for the ruling power (the chief) stands, so to speak; and sitting (he offers) the others, for the clan sits, so to speak.
3	1	16	The former he offers with the offering-ladle,when the Vashat is uttered, with both an invitatory formula (anuvâkyâ) and an offering-formula (yâgyâ); with the hand the others sitting, with the Svâhâ-call: he thus makes the clan subservient and obedient to the chieftain.
3	1	17	As to this they say, 'How do these (Mâruta oblations) also come to be offered for him by the offering-ladle, at the Vashat-call, and with invitatory and offering formulas?' Well, the first three feet of those seven-footed Mâruta (verses), being a three-footed Gâyatrî, are the invitatory formula, and the last four, being a four-footed Trishtubh, are the offering-formula. The one is the bowl, and the other the handle (of the offering-ladle), and the Svâhâ-call is the Vashat-call: in this way, then, these (Mâruta oblations) also become offered for him by the offering-ladle, at the Vashat-call, and with invitatory and offering-formulas.
3	1	18	And the first Mâruta (cake) which he offers on the right (south) side, is the seven (rivers) which flow eastwards. It is one of seven potsherds, for there are seven of. those (rivers) which flow eastwards.
3	1	19	And the first (cake) which he offers on the left (north) side, is the seasons; it is one of seven potsherds, for there are seven seasons.
3	1	20	And the second (cake) which he offers on the right side, is animals; it is one of seven potsherds, for there are seven domestic animals. He offers it close to the preceding one (representing the rivers): he thus settles animals near water.
3	1	21	And the second (cake) which he offers on the left side, is the seven Rishis; it is one of seven potsherds, for the seven Rishis are seven in number. He offers it close to the preceding one: he thus establishes the seven Rishis in the seasons.
3	1	22	And the third (cake) which he offers on the right side, is the vital airs; it is one of seven potsherds, for there are seven vital airs in the head. He offers it close to the preceding one: he thus puts the vital airs so as to be close to (not separated from) the head.
3	1	23	And the third (cake) which he offers on the left side, is the metres; it is one of seven potsherds, for there are seven metres increasing by four (syllables respectively). He offers it close to the preceding one: he thus places the metres close to the Rishis.
3	1	24	And the Aranyenûkya is the seven (rivers) which flow westwards; it is one of seven potsherds, for there are seven of those (rivers) which flow westwards. It is that downward vital air of his. That Aranyenûkya belongs to this Pragâpati; for the forest (aranya) is, as it were, concealed, and concealed, as it were, is that downward vital air; whence those who drink of these (downward flowing) rivers become most vile, most blasphemous, most lascivious in their speech. Whenever he here speaks of them as belonging to the Maruts, he makes them food for him (Agni)  and offers it to him, and gratifies him thereby.
3	1	25	That Vaisvânara (cake), doubtless, is yonder sun, and the Mâruta (cakes) are those rays. They are of seven potsherds each, for the troops of the Maruts consist of seven each.
3	1	26	He offers (the first Mâruta cake), with , 'The clear-lighted, and the bright- lighted, and the true-lighted, and the light, and the clear, and the law-observing, and the sinless one!'--these are their names: having completed that disk (of the sun, in the shape of the Vaisvânara), he bestows those rays on it by calling them by their names.
3	2	1	Thereupon  he (the Sacrificer ) offers the Vasor dhârâ. That whole Agni has now been completed, and he is here the Vasu (good one): to that Vasu the gods offered this shower (dhârâ), whence it is called 'Vasor dhârâ ;' and in like manner this (Sacrificer) offers to him this shower, and gratifies him thereby.
3	2	2	And, again, as to why he offers the 'Vasor dhârâ;'--this is his (Agni's) Abhisheka ; for thegods, having now completed him wholly and entirely, showered upon him those wishes (or, objects of desire), this 'Vasor dhârâ;' and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), now that he has completed him wholly and entirely, shower upon him those wishes, this 'Vasor dhârâ.' With ghee taken in five ladlings, and an offering-ladle of udumbara wood (he offers): the significance of this has been explained.
3	2	3	after offering the Vaisvânara (cake)--for the Vaisvânara is the head, and food is taken in from the head. (downwards); and, besides, it is from the head (downwards) that he who is anointed is anointed;--and after offering the Mâruta (cakes), for the Mârutas are the vital airs, and through (the channels of) the vital airs food is eaten; and, besides, it is at (the openings of) the vital airs that he who is anointed is anointed .
3	2	4	And, furthermore, (it is offered) upon the Aranyenûkya ; for the Aranyenûkya is speech, and it is through (the channel of) speech that food is eaten; and, besides, it is with speech that he whois anointed is anointed. And everything here is wealth (vasu), for all these (cake-offerings) are (connected with special) wishes ; and in order that this shower, be it of milk or of ghee, (may be) fraught with wealth, this oblation of ghee is thus offered for the beginning; and inasmuch as this shower is fraught with wealth, it is called 'shower of wealth.'
3	2	5	He (as it were) says, 'This is mine, and that is mine;'--that is, 'Herewith I gratify thee, and therewith;--herewith I anoint thee, and therewith;' or, 'Give me this, and that!' And as soon as that shower reaches the fire, that prayer is fulfilled.
3	2	6	Now the gods, having gratified him (Agni) by this food, or by these objects of desire , and having anointed him by this shower of wealth, solicited from him these objects of desire ; and having received offering, and being gratified and anointed, he granted them these objects of desire; and in like manner this (Sacrificer), having gratified him by this food, and by these offerings of desire, and anointed him with this shower of wealth, now solicits from him these objects of desire; and having received offering, and being gratified and anointed, he (Agni) grants him these objects of desire. In order to avoid discontinuance, he each time embraces two wishes,--even as one would connect those living away from one another,--thinking, 'In this way shall they prosper by sacrifice!'
3	2	7	The gods now spake, 'Through whom shall we receive these objects of desire? By our ownself,' they said; for the sacrifice is the self of the gods, and so is the sacrifice that of the Sacrificer; and when he says, 'By the sacrifice they shall prosper!' he means to say, 'By my own self they shall prosper!'
3	2	8	In twelve (things) he causes them to prosper , the year consists of twelve months, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much food he thus gratifies him, and by so much food he thus consecrates him. In fourteen he causes them to prosper; in eight he causes them to prosper; in ten he causes them to prosper; in thirteen he causes them to prosper.
3	2	9	He then offers the Ardhendra (libations) ;the ardhendras are everything here : he thus gratifies him (Agni) with everything, and with everything he thus consecrates him.
3	2	10	He then offers (the libations relating to) the Grahas ;--the grahas (cups of soma, offered tothe deities), doubtless, are sacrifice: by sacrifice, by food, he thus gratifies him; and by sacrifice he thus consecrates him.
3	3	1	He then offers these Yagñakratus  (sacrificial rites), with,' May the Agni and the Gharma (prosper) for me!'--by these sacrificial rites he thus gratifies him, and by these sacrificial rites he thus consecrates him.
3	3	2	He then offers (the libations relating to) the Uneven Stomas ;--for the gods, having now obtained their desires, by means of the uneven Stomas went up to heaven; and in like manner does the Sacrificer, now that he has obtained all his desires, by means of the uneven Stomas go up to heaven.
3	3	3	Now this (set runs) up to the thirty-three-versed (hymn-form), for the Trayastrimsa is the last of the uneven Stomas: at the last the gods thuswent up to heaven; and in like manner does the Sacrificer thereby at the last go up to heaven.
3	3	4	He then offers (those relating to) the Even (Stomas) ;--for the metres then said, 'The uneven stomas are worn out, by means of the even ones we will go up to heaven!' By means of the even stomas they went up to heaven; and in like manner does the Sacrificer thus, by means of the even stomas, go up to heaven.
3	3	5	This (set runs) up to the forty-eight-versed (hymn-form), for the Ashtâkatvârimsa is the last of the even stomas: at the last the metres thus went up to heaven; and in like manner does the Sacrificer thereby at the last go up to heaven.
3	3	6	He says, 'May the One and the Three (prosper) for me!'--'May the Four and the Eight (prosper) for me!'--even as one climbing a tree would climb up by taking hold of an ever higher branch, so is this. And as to why he offers the Stomas,--the stomas are food: it is with food he thus consecrates him.
3	3	7	He then offers (the libations relating to) the Age-grades  (of cattle),--age-grades mean cattle: it is by cattle, for his food, that he thus gratifieshim; and by cattle, for his food, he thus consecrates him.
3	3	8	He then offers whilst mentioning names ;--for the gods, having obtained all their wishes, now gratified him directly; and in like manner does the Sacrificer, having obtained all his wishes, now gratify him directly. 'To Strength, hail! to Gain, hail!'--these are his (Agni's) names: it is by mentioning his names that he thus gratifies him.
3	3	9	There are thirteen of these names,--a year consists of thirteen months, and the layers and fillings of the fire-altar amount to thirteen: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus gratifies him. And as to why he offers while mentioning names,--it is thus in mentioning his (Agni's) names that he consecrates him.
3	3	10	He then says, 'This is thy realm; a supporter and sustainer art thou for the friend: for sustenance, for rain, for the lordship of creatures (do I consecrate) thee;'--sustenance, doubtless, means food, and rain means food: by food he thus gratifies him.
3	3	11	And when he says, 'This is thy realm; a supporter and sustainer art thou for the friend: for sustenance, for rain, for the lordship of creatures--thee!' this is to say, 'This is thy kingdom; thou art consecrated (anointed)! thou art thy friend's supporter and sustainer: for our sustenance art thou, for rain unto us art thou, for our lordship ofcreatures art thou!' They thereby entreat him, 'For all this art thou unto us: for all this have we consecrated thee!' And therefore people thus entreat a human king who has been consecrated.
3	3	12	He then offers the Prospering  (libations);--the prospering (libations) are the vital airs: it is the vital airs he thus puts into him.--'May the vital strength prosper by sacrifice! may the vital air prosper by sacrifice! . . .' He thus puts proper vital airs into him.
3	3	13	Twelve prospering (libations) he offers,--a year consists of twelve months, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus puts proper vital airs into him. And as to why he offers the prospering (libations),--the prospering (libations) are vital airs, and the vital airs are the immortal element: with the immortal element he thus consecrates him.
3	3	14	He then says, 'The Stoma, and the Yagus, and the Rik, and the Sâman, and the Brihat, and the Rathantara,'--this, doubtless, is the triple science, and the triple science is food: it is with food he thus gratifies him, and with food he thus consecrates him;--'to the heavenly light we gods have gone, we have become immortal,'--for he indeed goes to the heavenly light, and becomes immortal;--'Pragâpati's children have we become!'--for he indeed becomes Pragâpati's child,--'vet! svâhâ!'--the Vet-call, doubtless, isesoterically the same as the Vashat-call, and either with the Vashat-call, or the Svâhâ-call is food offered to the gods: he thus gratifies him by both the Vashat and the Svâhâ, and also consecrates him by both of them. He now throws the offering-ladle after (the ghee into the fire) lest what there is anointed with ghee should remain outside of the fire.
3	3	15	Now as to this same shower of wealth, the body (from which it flows) is the sky, the udder the cloud, the teat the lightning, and the shower (of ghee) is the (rain-) shower: from the sky it comes to the cow.
3	3	16	Its body is the cow, its udder the (cow's) udder, its teat the (cow's) teat, its shower the shower (of milk): from the cow (it comes) to the Sacrificer.
3	3	17	Its body is the Sacrificer, its udder his arm, its teat the offering-ladle, its shower (of milk) the shower of (ghee): from the Sacrificer (it goes) to the gods; from the gods to the cow, from the cow to the Sacrificer: thus circulates this perpetual, never-ending food of the gods. And, verily, for whosoever knows this, there will thus be perpetual, never-ending food. Now as to the (mystic) correspondence.
3	3	18	As to this they say, 'How does this wealth-shower of his obtain (conformity with) the year, and Agni? how does it correspond to the year, to Agni?' Well, this shower of wealth consists of three hundred and sixty (libations), and of (other) six, and of thirty-five. Now, the three hundred and sixty which there are,--so many being the days in the year,--thereby it obtains the days of the year. And what six there are,--the seasons beingsix in number,--thereby it obtains the nights of the seasons: thus it obtains both the days and nights of the year. And what thirty-five there are, they are the (intercalary) thirteenth month , and that is the body,--the body (consists) of thirty (limbs), the feet of two, the breath of two (in-breathing and up-breathing), and the head is the thirty-fifth: so much is the year; and thus that shower of wealth of his obtains (conformity with) the year, and Agni; and thus it corresponds to the year, to Agni. And so many are the bricks with special formulas which are placed in the centre of a Sândila fire-altar; for these bricks indeed are the same as these different Agnis ; and thus these Agnis of his come to have oblations offered to them separately by means of the shower of wealth.
3	3	19	As to this they say, 'How does this shower of wealth of his attain to (conformity with) the Great Litany, how does it correspond to the Great Litany?' Well, the first nine formulas of this shower of wealth are the threefold  head; and the forty-eight which follow are the twenty-four-fold wings ; and the twenty-five which follow are the twenty-five-fold body ; and the twenty-one which follow are the tail, as the twenty-first ; and thethirty-five which follow are the Vasa (hymn); and by the eighties (of verses) which follow those eighties (Of the mahad uktham) are obtained, for by eighties the Great Litany is counted; and what there is after the eighties, that to him (corresponds to) what, in the Great Litany, there is after the eighties ; and thus this shower of wealth of his attains to (conformity with) the Great Litany, and corresponds to the Great Litany.
3	4	1	He then offers the Vâgaprasavîya  (set of fourteen libations),--'vâga' (strength, sustenance) means food (anna): it thus is an 'anna-prasavîya' for him, and it is food he thereby raises (pra-sû) for him (Agni).
3	4	2	For the gods, now that they had gratified him by that food, and consecrated him by those objects of desire, (to wit) by that stream of wealth , hereby gratified him once more; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), now that he has gratified him by that food, and consecrated him by those objects of desire, that shower of wealth, hereby gratify him once more.
3	4	3	And, again, as to why he offers the Vâgaprasavîya. This, to be sure, is his (Agni's) Abhisheka. For, the gods, having gratified him by that food, and consecrated him by those objects of desire, (to wit) by that shower of wealth, then by this (offering) consecrated him once more; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), having gratified him by that food, and consecrated him by those objects of desire, that shower of wealth, hereby consecrate him once more.
3	4	4	It consists of (seeds of) all (kinds of) plants,--that which consists of all plants is all food: he thus gratifies him with all food, and with all food he thus consecrates him. Let him set aside one of these kinds of food, and not eat thereof as long as he lives. With an udumbara (ficus glomerata) cup  and an udumbara dipping-spoon (he offers): the significance of these two has been explained. They are both four-cornered,--there are four quarters: he thus gratifies him with food from every quarter, and by means of food from every quarter he thus consecrates him.
3	4	5	And, again, as to why he performs the Vâgaprasavîya;--he thereby gratifies those same deities who have been consecrated by this very rite of consecration by which he is now about to be consecrated, and, thus gratified by offering, they grant him permission (to perform) this rite of consecration, and, permitted by them, he becomes consecrated; for only he becomes king whom the (other) kings allow to assume the royal dignity, but not he whomthey do not (allow to do so). Thus when he offers in the fire he consecrates Agni, and when he offers to these deities, he gratifies those gods who rule over this consecration ceremony.
3	4	6	And, indeed, he offers here also the Pârtha  (oblations);--for the gods now desired, 'May we be consecrated even on this occasion by all the rites of consecration!' They were indeed consecrated on this occasion by all the rites of consecration; and in like manner is the Sacrificer on this occasion consecrated by all the rites of consecration.
3	4	7	Now these Pârtha (oblations) are the Vâgaprasavîya of the Râgasûya; and by offering these (oblations) he is consecrated by the Râgasûya; and the first seven of the succeeding fourteen (Vâgaprasavîya oblations) are the Vâgaprasavîya ceremony of the Vâgapeya : thus, by offering these he is consecrated by the Vâgapeya. And what other seven there are, they belong to Agni (or, the Agnikayana): by offering these, he is consecrated by the Agni-consecration.
3	4	8	He first offers those of the Râgasûya, then those of the Vâgapeya; for by performing the Râgasûya one becomes king (râgâ) and by the Vâgapeya emperor (samrâg), and the position of king is (obtained) first, and thereafter that ofemperor : hence after performing the Vâgapeya, one could not perform the Râgasûya,--it would be a descent, just as if one who is emperor were to become king.
3	4	9	Those (seven Vâgaprasavîya oblations) of the fire-altar he offers last, for the Agni-consecration indeed is (equal to) all those rites of consecration, and he who is consecrated by the Agni-consecration rite becomes everything, king and emperor: therefore he offers those of the fire-altar last of all.
3	4	10	He then anoints him on a black antelope skin,--for the black antelope skin is (a symbol of) the sacrifice: it is thus at the sacrifice that he anoints him. On the hairy side (of the skin),--for the hairs are the metres: on the metres he thus anoints him. On the left (north) side (of the fire-altar he anoints him): the significance of this (will be explained) further on. On (the skin laid down) with the neck-part towards the front, for that (tends) godwards.
3	4	11	Some, however, anoint him on the right (south) side of the fire-altar, on the ground that it is from the right side that food is served, and that they thus anoint him from the food-side. But let him not do so, for that (southern) region belongs to the Fathers, and quickly he goes to that region whom they anoint in that way.
3	4	12	And some, indeed, anoint him on the Âhavanîya, on the ground that the Âhavanîya is the world of heaven, and that they thus anoint him in the world of heaven. But let him not do so, for that (Âhavanîya, the fire-altar,) is his (the Sacrificer's)divine body, and this (Sacrificer, or Sacrificer's real body) is his human one: they thus attach that divine body of his to this his mortal body, if they anoint him in this way.
3	4	13	Let him anoint him on the left (north) side and nowhere else, for that north-eastern region belongs to both gods and men: they thus anoint him whilst seated and established in his own region, for he who is established in his own seat suffers no injury.
3	4	14	One who has gained a position in the world should be anointed sitting, for one who has gained a position is seated, so to speak;--and one who is striving to gain one standing, for one who wishes to gain a position, stands, so to speak. On a he-goat's skin should be anointed one desirous of prosperity, on a black-antelope skin one desirous of spiritual lustre, on both (kinds of skins) one desirous of both: that (skin) he spreads north of the tail (of the fire-altar) with its hair uppermost and its neck-part towards the east.
3	4	15	Close to the enclosing-stones : inasmuch as the black-antelope skin is close to the enclosing-stones, so that divine body of his is consecrated on the black-antelope skin; and inasmuch as he is consecrated whilst keeping hold of the fire-altar he is not cut off from that divine consecration (of the Fire).
3	4	16	He anoints him after making offering on the fire-altar, for that (altar) is his divine body, andthis (Sacrificer himself) is his human one; and the gods indeed were first, and thereafter the men: therefore, after making offering, he anoints him with what remains over of that same (offering-material) . He then throws the dipping-spoon after (the oblations into the fire).
3	4	17	Placing himself near the (Sacrificer's) right arm, he then anoints him , with , 'At the impulse of the divine Savitri, I anoint thee, by the arms of the Asvins, by the hands of Pûshan, by the support of Sarasvatî Vâk, the supporter, by the universal sovereignty of Agni!'--for Sarasvatî is Vâk (speech), and hers is all this support. Impelled by Savitri, he thus anoints him by all this support of Sarasvatî Vâk, the supporter, and by the universal sovereignty of Agni. Here he throws the cup (into the fire), lest what is anointed (with offering material) should remain outside the fire.
3	4	18	He anoints him h the middle of the Pârtha oblations, for the Pârtha oblations are the year: he thus places him in the middle of the year. Six he offers before, and six after (the consecration ceremony), for there are six seasons: by the seasons he thus encloses (guards) him who is consecrated on both sides. Brihaspati is the last of the first (six ), and Indra the first of thelast (six),--Brihaspati is the priesthood (or priestly office), and Indra is the nobility (or political power): by the priesthood and the nobility he thus encloses him who is consecrated on both sides.
4	1	1	He then offers the Râshtrabhrit (realm-sustaining) oblations;--the realm-sustainers, doubtless, are the kings, for it is they that sustain realms. These deities, indeed, have been consecrated by this same consecration ceremony by which he (the Sacrificer) is now to be consecrated: it is them he thereby gratifies, and thus gratified by offering, they grant him permission (to perform) this consecration ceremony, and, permitted by them, he is consecrated; for only he becomes king whom the (other) kings allow (to assume) the royal dignity, but not he whom they do not (allow to assume it). And inasmuch as the kings sustain realms, and these gods are kings, therefore Realm-sustaining (oblations are performed).
4	1	2	And, again, as to why he offers the Realm-sustaining (oblations). From Pragâpati, when dismembered, couples went forth, in the form of Gandharvas and Apsaras; and he, having turned into a chariot, enclosed them, and having enclosed them, he took them to himself and made them his own; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), thereby enclosing them, take them to himself and make them his own.
4	1	3	Now that Pragâpati who was dismembered, is this very Agni who is here being built up; andthose couples which went forth from him, are these same deities to whom he now makes offering.
4	1	4	He makes offering to the Gandharvas and Apsaras, for in the form of Gandharvas and Apsaras they went forth (from Pragâpati). But the Gandharvas and Apsaras also busy themselves with sweet scent (gandha) and beauteous form (rûpa ), whence if any one goes to his mate he cultivates sweet scent and a beautiful appearance.
4	1	5	He offers pairs (of oblations), for birth originates from a pair; and he alone is (ruler of) a kingdom who propagates offspring, but not he who does not propagate offspring. And inasmuch as couples sustain the realm, and these deities consist of couples, these (oblations are called) Realm-sustainers. With ghee taken in twelve ladlings (he offers), and there are twelve of these oblations: the significance of this has been explained.
4	1	6	To the male (deity) he makes offering first, then to the females: he thereby endows the male pre-eminently with power . To a single male he makes offering, and to many females, whence even a single man has many wives. To the male (deity) he makes offering both with the Vashat-call and the Svâhâ-call, to the female (deities) only with the Svâhâ: he thereby endows the male pre-eminently with power.
4	1	7	, 'Thelaw-upholding, law-abiding,'--that is, the truth-upholding, truth-abiding,--'Agni is the Gandharva: his Apsaras are the plants,'--for as a Gandharva, Agni, indeed, went forth with the plants as the Asparas, his mates,--'Delights (mud) by name,'--the plants are indeed delights, for everything here delights in plants--'may he protect this our priesthood and nobility: to him Hail! Vât! To them (fem.) Hail!' The meaning of this has been explained
4	1	8	'The Close-knit,'--yonder sun is indeed close-knit, for he knits together the days and nights;--'all-wealthy,'--for that (sun) indeed is every kind of wealth;--'Sûrya is the Gandharva: his Apsaras are the sun-motes;'--for as a Gandharva, the sun, indeed, went forth with the sun-motes as the Apsaras, his mates,--'Mobile (âyu) by name,'--for moving together , as it were, the sun-motes float;--'may he protect this our priesthood and nobility,'--the meaning of this has been explained.
4	1	9	'The most blessed,'--that is, the most worthy of worship,--'sun-rayed,'--for like the sun's are the moon's rays;--'Kandramas (themoon) is the Gandharva: his Apsaras are the stars;'--for as a Gandharva the moon, indeed, went forth with the stars as the Apsaras, his mates;--'Luminous (bhekuri) by name;'--light-giving (bhâkuri ) these, indeed, are called, for the stars give light;--'may he protect this our priesthood and nobility!' the meaning of this has been explained.
4	1	10	'The Agile,'--that is, the swift,--'all-expansive,'--for the wind (air), indeed, makes up all this expanse;--'Vâta (the wind) is the Gandharva: his Apsaras are the waters,'--for as a Gandharva the wind, indeed, went forth with the waters as the Apsaras, his mates;--'Viands (ûrg) by name,'--the waters, indeed, are called 'ûrgah,' for food is produced from the waters;--'may he protect this our priesthood and nobility!' the meaning of this has been explained.
4	1	11	'The beneficent, well-winged,'--beneficent (bhugyu ) indeed is the sacrifice, for the sacrifice benefits all beings,--'Yagña (the sacrifice) is the Gandharva: his Apsaras are the offering-gifts,'--for as a Gandharva the sacrifice, indeed, went forth, with the offering-gifts as the Apsaras,his mates;--'Praises (stâvâ) by name,'--the offering-gifts are indeed praises, for the sacrifice is praised for offering-gifts; and whosoever gives an offering-gift (to priests) is praised;--'may he protect this our priesthood and nobility!' the meaning of this has been explained.
4	1	12	'The lord of creatures, the all-worker,'--Pragâpati (lord of creatures) is indeed the all-worker, for he has wrought all this (universe);--'Manas (the mind) is the Gandharva: his Apsaras are the hymn-verses and hymn-tunes,'--as a Gandharva, the Mind indeed went forth, with the hymn-verses and hymn-tunes as the Apsaras, his mates;--'Wishes (eshti) by name,'--the hymn-verses and hymn-tunes are indeed wishes, for by verses and tunes people pray, 'May this accrue unto us! may it fare thus with us!'--'may he protect this our priest and nobility!' 'the meaning of this has been explained.
4	1	13	He then makes an offering on the Head of the Chariot;--this, indeed, is that very rite of consecration,--and by that he is now consecrated,--which this (Sacrificer) is permitted to perform by those deities with whose permission he is consecrated ; for he alone becomes king whom the (other) kings allow (to assume) the royal dignity, and not he whom (they do) not (allow to assume it). With ghee taken in five ladlings (he offers), and this is offered as five oblations: the significance of this has been explained.
4	1	14	On the head (or front part of the chariot theoffering is made), for it is from the head (downwards) that he who is anointed is anointed,--whilst it is held above (the Âhavanîya), for above (others) is he who is thus anointed;--with the same formula (repeated each time), for one and the same (person) is he who is thus anointed;--whilst taking round (the chariot-head) in every direction : on every side he thus is anointed.
4	1	15	And, again, as to why he makes offering on the head of the chariot;--it is because this chariot is yonder sun; for it was by assuming that form that Pragâpati enclosed those couples, and took them to himself, and made them his own; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) thereby enclose them, and take them to himself, and make them his own. Whilst it (the chariot-head) is held above (the fire, he offers), for above (others) was he who, enclosing those couples, took them to himself, and made them his own;--and with the same formula, for one and the same is he who, by enclosing those couples, took them to himself, and made them his own.
4	1	16	, 'O Lord of the world, Lord of creatures!'--for this (Agni), indeed, is the lord of the world, and the lord of creatures;--'thou whose dwellings are on high, or here below,'--both on high andhere below, indeed, are his dwellings;--'to this priesthood and this nobility of ours,'--for this Agni is both the priesthood and the nobility,--'grant thou mighty protection, hail!'--that is, 'grant thou powerful protection!'
4	2	1	He then offers (three) oblations of air;--this fire-altar is these (three) worlds, and the oblations of air are wind: he thus places the wind into these worlds, and hence there is wind here in these worlds.
4	2	2	He takes (the air) from outside the Vedi; for that wind which is in these worlds is already contained in this (fire-altar), and he now puts into it that wind which is beyond these worlds.
4	2	3	From outside the Vedi (he takes it),--for the Vedi is this (earth), and the wind which is on this (earth) is already contained in this (fire-altar): he now puts into it the wind which is beyond this (earth).
4	2	4	By his two hollow hands (he takes it), for only in this way is the catching of that (wind brought about). With the Svâhâ-call (he offers), for he offers just under the shafts (of the chariot),--this chariot is yonder sun: he thus places the wind on this side of the sun, and hence that one blows on this side thereof.
4	2	5	, 'Thou art the cloudy ocean,'--the cloudy ocean, doubtless, is yonder world (of the sky),--'the giver of moisture,'--for that (wind) indeed gives moisture: he thus bestows on this (fire-altar) the wind which is in yonder world;--'blow thou kindly and propitiously upon me, hail!'--that is, 'blow favourably and gently upon me!'
4	2	6	'Thou art the stormy (region), the troop of the Maruts,'--the stormy (region), the troop of the Maruts, doubtless, is the air-world: he thus bestows on this (fire-altar) the wind which is in the air-world;--'blow thou kindly and propitiously upon me, hail!'--that is, 'blow favourably and gently upon me!'
4	2	7	'Thou art the one affording protection and worship,'--the one that affords protection and worship, doubtless, is this (terrestrial) world: he thus bestows upon this (fire-altar) the wind which is in this world;--'blow thou kindly and propitiously upon me, hail!'--that is, 'blow favourably and gently upon me!'
4	2	8	With three (formulas) he offers,--three are these worlds, and threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus puts air into these worlds.
4	2	9	And as to why he offers the oblations of air: he thereby yokes that chariot of his; for it was thereby that the gods yoked that chariot for (the obtainment of) all their wishes, thinking, 'By it, when yoked, we shall obtain them;' and by that yoked (chariot) they indeed obtained their wishes; and in like manner does the Sacrificer thereby yoke that chariot of his for (the obtainment of) all his wishes, thinking, 'By it, when yoked, I shall obtain them; and by that yoked (chariot) he indeed obtains all his wishes.
4	2	10	He yokes it with the oblations of air ,--the oblations of air are the vital airs it is thus with thevital airs he yokes it . With three (oblations) he yokes it,--there are three vital airs, the out-breathing, up-breathing, and through-breathing: it is with these he thus yokes it. Just below the shaft (he offers), for just below the shaft the horse is yoked;--with his hands, for by the hands the horse is yoked;--in moving round , for in moving round the horse is yoked.
4	2	11	The right yoke-horse he puts to first, then the left yoke-horse, then the right side-horse: for thus it is (done) among the gods, otherwise in human (practice). Let him not yoke that (chariot ) again, lest he should yoke again the yoked one; but let him give away the vehicle, thinking, 'I shall reap the benefit of the yoking of it .' They carry it as far as the Adhvaryu's dwelling, holding it right upwards, for above is that (Agni). He presents it to the Adhvaryu, for it is he that performs therewith. Let him, however, (not) assign it to him (till) the time of the offering-gifts.
4	2	12	He then offers the 'Lightsome ' oblations. For now the whole Agni was completed; he now wished for brilliance (ruk), and the gods, by means of these lightsome (oblations), endowed him with brilliance; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now endow him therewith.
4	2	13	And, again, as to why he offers the lightsome oblations. When Pragâpati was dismembered, his brilliance departed from him. When the gods restored him, they, by means of these lightsome oblations, endowed him with brilliance; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) endow him therewith.
4	2	14	, 'O Agni, what lights of thine in the sun  . . . ' 'O ye gods, what lights of yours are in the sun. . . '--'Bestow thou light upon our priests, (work thou light in our kings, light in our people and Sûdras, bestow light upon me by thy light)!' He thus says 'light' each time,--light is immortality: it is immortality he thus bestows upon him.
4	2	15	He then offers one relating to Varuna. That whole Agni has now been completed, and he now is the deity Varuna: it is to him that he offers this oblation, and by the oblation he makes him (Agni) a deity, for that one alone is a deity to whom offering is made, but not that one to whom (offering is) not (made). With a verse addressed to Varuna (he offers): he thus gratifies him by his own self, by his own deity.
4	2	16	And, again, as to why he offers one relatingto Varuna. When Pragâpati was dismembered, his strength departed from him. When the gods restored him they, by this (oblation), bestowed strength upon him; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) bestow it upon him. With a verse addressed to Varuna (he offers),--Varuna is the ruling power, and ruling power means strength: it is thus by strength that he bestows strength upon him.
4	2	17	, 'For this I appeal to thee, worshipping thee with prayer,'--that is, 'For that I beseech thee, worshipping thee with prayer;'--'for this the Sacrificer imploreth thee with offerings,'--that is, 'for this, this Sacrificer implores thee with offerings;--'without wrath listen thou here, O Varuna!'--that is, 'without anger listen thou here to us, O Varuna!'--'take not our life from us, O far-ruler!'--he thereby gives utterance to a surrender of his own self.
4	2	18	He then offers the Arkâsvamedha-santati  oblations. The light (arka), doubtless, is this fire (Agni), and the Asvamedha (horse-sacrifice) is yonder sun,--when created, these two were separate: by means of these oblations the gods drew them together and connected them; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), by means of these oblations, now draw them together and connect them.
4	2	19	, 'Heaven-like heat, hail!'--the heat, doubtless, is yonder sun; he thus establishes yonder sun in Agni.
4	2	20	'Heaven-like flame, hail!'--the flame isthis Agni: he thus establishes this Agni in yonder sun.
4	2	21	'The Heaven-like shining one, hail!' the shining one, doubtless, is yonder sun: he places him again up there.
4	2	22	'Heaven -like light, hail!'--the light is this Agni: he places him again here (on the fire-altar).
4	2	23	'The heaven-like Sûrya, hail!'--Sûrya, doubtless, is yonder sun: he thus places yonder sun highest of all this (universe), whence he is the highest of all this (universe).
4	2	24	These are five oblations he offers, the fire-altar consists of five layers, a year of five seasons, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus draws together and connects those two.
4	2	25	And as to why he says, 'Heaven-like heat, hail! heaven-like flame, hail!'--these indeed are names of this fire: he thereby gratifies these, and by the offering he makes them a deity; for only that one is a deity to whom an oblation is offered, but not that to whom it is not offered. Moreover, by naming them, he thus places them on this fire-altar.
4	2	26	These are five oblations he offers,--the fire-altar consists of five layers, and the year of five seasons, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much food he thus gratifies him.
4	2	27	Now as to the insertion  of (any other) oblations. If he should know any oblation supplied with a brâhmana (dogmatic explanation) let him offer it atthis time; for it is for (the obtainment of his) wishes that he yokes this chariot, and whatsoever oblation he offers on this occasion he offers as one that is (to be) fulfilled.
4	2	28	As to this they say, 'Let him not offer (any additional oblations), lest he should do what is excessive.' Let him, nevertheless, offer them; for it is for (special) wishes that these oblations are offered, and in wishes there is nothing excessive.
4	3	1	Having now returned (to the hall), he, at the proper time, throws up the Dhishnyas  (fire-hearths)--these hearths are fires: he thus builds up fire-altars. They are the clansmen, and the built-up fire-altar is the chieftaincy: he thus sets up both the chieftaincy and the clan. The former (altar) he builds up first, then these (hearths): thus he sets up the clan after setting up the chieftaincy.
4	3	2	That (fire-altar) is a single one: he thus makes the chieftaincy to attach to a single (person), and (social) distinction to attach to a single (person). The others are numerous: he thus bestows multiplicity on the clan.
4	3	3	That (fire-altar) consists of five layers, the others of a single layer: he thus endows the chieftain (or, ruler) pre-eminently with power, and makes the chieftain more powerful than the clan (or people). Upwards he builds that one: he thus builds the ruling power upward by (social) layers; sideways the others: he thus makes the clan obedient to the chieftain from below.
4	3	4	That one he builds up both with the Yagushmatî (bricks laid down with a special formula), and with the Lokamprinâ (or space-filling ones, laid down with a common formula); the others with the space-filling one alone: he thus endows the chieftain pre-eminently with power, and makes the chieftain more powerful than the clan, and the clan less powerful than the chieftain.
4	3	5	And when he builds up these (hearths) only with the space-filling one, the Lokamprinâ being the nobility --he thereby places the chieftain, as the eater, among the clan. He builds up (dhishnya-hearths) both of the Soma-sacrifice , and of the fire-altar; first those of the Soma-sacrifice, and then those of the fire-altar: the significance of this has been explained. Whatever Soma-hearth he (merely) throws up (at the Soma-sacrifice), that he (now) builds up. The Âgnîdhrîya he builds first, for thatone he throws up first (at the Soma-sacrifice); (he does so) whilst sitting to the right (south) of it: the significance of this has been explained .
4	3	6	On this (Âgnîdhrîya) he puts eight bricks,--the Gâyatrî consists of eight syllables, and Agni is of Gâyatra nature: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great he thus builds him up. The variegated stone  is the ninth of them: there are nine vital airs--seven in the head and two downward ones--it is these he thus puts into it. The fire which is placed on the erected (hearth) is the tenth;--there are ten vital airs , and the Âgnîdhra is the middle (between the Gârhapatya and Âhavanîya fires).: he thus puts the vital airs in the middle of it; for the vital airs, being in the middle of the body, move along it in this direction, and in that direction.
4	3	7	Twenty-one he places on the Hotrîya (hearth), and there are twenty-one enclosing-stones : the significance of this has been explained.
4	3	8	Six (he places) on the Mârgâlîya,--these are the six seasons, the Fathers; for the seasons, the Fathers , indeed, heaped up (a rampart) round that (fire) from the south. This one lies to the south of those (other hearths) ,--this (Âgnîdhrîya) he lays down in this way (direction), and these (other hearths) in this way, and that one (the Fire-altar) in this way: he thereby makes the peasantry look towards the chieftain.
4	3	9	He then encloses these (hearths) by enclosing-stones;--the enclosing-stones are the waters: it is thus by water that he surrounds them . He merely lays them down all round, for those of the waters which flow in a hollow (channel) are the chieftain, and these stray waters are the clansmen; thus, when he encloses that (great fire-altar) by a dug-in (row of stones), he thereby adds power to power, and sure rounds (protects) power by power; and when he merely lays down those (enclosing-stones of the hearths) all round, he thereby adds clansman (or clan) to clansman, and surrounds (protects) clansman by clansman . As many bricks with special formulas asthere are (in each hearth) so many enclosing-stones there are (in each); for with that (fire-altar) there are as many enclosing-stones as there are such bricks in it : he thus makes the clan obedient and subservient to the chief.
4	3	10	He then scatters a layer of earth on (each of) these (hearths): the significance of this has been explained . Silently  (he scatters it), for indistinct is the clan (or people). Then, after the cake-offering of the Agnîshomîya (animal sacrifice) , he prepares the propitiatory oblations to the Regions;--that fire-altar is the regions: it is to them he offers these oblations, and thus by offering makes them a deity, for only that one is a deity to whom an oblation is offered, but not that to whom if is. not offered. There are five (such oblations), for there are five regions.
4	3	11	As to this they say,--Let him prepare thisoffering (ishti) so as to consist of material for ten oblations;--this (offering) is (performed) with all the stomas and all the prishtha (sâmans) ; and there are (used in it) all the metres, all the regions, all the seasons--and this Agni (the fire-altar) is all this: he thus, by the (amount of) offering material (taken out for the ishti), makes (Agni) the deity ; for only that one is the deity for whom the oblation is prepared, not one for whom it is not prepared. There are (in that case) ten (oblations),--the Virâg (metre) consists of ten syllables, and Agni is virâg (far-shining, or far-ruling); there are ten regions, and Agni (the fire-altar) is the regions; ten vital airs, and Agni is the vital airs: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much food he thus gratifies him.
4	3	12	But, indeed, he may also take out these oblations for the Divine Quickeners ; for these are the deities which become consecrated by this consecration ceremony by which he is now to be consecrated: it is them he thus gratifies, and gratified by offering they permit him (to perform) this consecration ceremony, and with their permission he isconsecrated; for only he becomes king whom the (other) kings allow (to assume) the royal dignity, but not he whom they do not (allow to assume it). And inasmuch as these deities are consecrated (quickened) by this consecration ceremony and quicken him for this consecration, they are (called) the Divine Quickeners.
4	3	13	These (deities) come to have two. names, as he who is consecrated by the rite of consecration comes to have two names; for the very rite of consecration for which he is quickened, and by which he is consecrated (quickened), is his second name .
4	3	14	There are eight (such deities),--the Gâyatrî consists of eight syllables, and Agni is of Gâyatra nature: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much food he thus gratifies him.
4	3	15	As to this they say,--He ought not to offer (any of) these oblations, lest he should do what is excessive. Let him nevertheless offer them; for these oblations are offered for (the obtainment of special) wishes, and in wishes there is nothing excessive. And whatsoever oblation he offers after the Pasupurodâsa (the cake-offering connected with the animal sacrifice), that is placed inside the animal victim itself as its sacrificial sap . He offers both kinds (of oblations), those of the Soma-sacrifice and those of the fire-altar (or Agnikayana), first those of the Soma-sacrifice, and afterwards those of the fire-altar the purport of this has been explained. In a loud voice  the Pasupurodâsa offering (is performed), in a low voice these (additional oblations), for they are an ishti . With the Pasupurodâsa he (the Adhvaryu) says, 'Recite!--Urge!' and with these (oblations), 'Recite!--Worship ' for they are an ishti. There is the same Svishtakrit and the same idâ  (for these oblations). The (Devasû) deities have received offering, and the Svishtakrit (of the Pasupurodâsa) has not yet been attended to ,--
4	3	16	He then touches it (the fire-altar) with (the formula of) the preliminary consecration , 'May Savitri quicken thee for (powers of) quickening ! . . . This (man), O ye (people), is your king; Soma is the king of us Brâhmanas!'--he thereby excludes the Brâhmanas (from the power of the king) and makes them such as are not to be fed upon (by the king).
4	4	1	Then, early next morning , when about to bespeak the morning prayer , he yokes the Fire-altar, thinking, 'With it, when yoked, I shall obtain; and by it, when yoked, he obtains all wishes. Heyokes it prior to the whole performance, so that all that is done thereafter is laden on that yoked (altar-cart).
4	4	2	He yokes it on the enclosing-sticks, for those enclosing-sticks are fires : it is with fires he thus yokes the fire-altar.
4	4	3	Having touched the middle enclosing-stick , he mutters this formula , 'The Fire I yoke with might, with ghee!'--might means strength: thus, 'The fire I yoke (furnish) with strength, with ghee;'--'the heavenly bird, great in vigour,'--for that (fire-altar) is indeed a heavenly bird, and great in vigour, in smoke ;--'Thereby we will go to the region of the bay, rising unto the light, beyond the highest firmament!'--The firmament, doubtless, is the heavenly world: thus, 'Thereby we will go to the region, of the bay (horse, the sun) mounting up to the heavenly world, beyond the highest firmament.'
4	4	4	Then on the southern (right) one, with , 'By these never-decaying, feathered wings of thine wherewith thou repellest the demons, O Agni, may we fly to the world of the righteous whither the erst-born seers went of old!' he thereby alludes to those Rishis .
4	4	5	Then on the northern (left) one, with , 'The potent drop, the faithful eagle, the golden-winged bird, the active (bhuranyu),'--golden means immortal: thus, 'the immortal-winged bird, the bearer (bhartri);'--'the mighty is seated in the firm seat: homage be to thee, injure me not!'--he thereby gives utterance to a surrender of his own self.
4	4	6	Now that middle formula is the body, and the two on both sides thereof are the wings (of the bird-shaped altar): hence these two allude to 'wings ,' for these two are the wings.
4	4	7	With three (formulas) he yokes it,--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus yokes him.
4	4	8	And when he has pressed the king (Soma) he offers in the fire . This, indeed, is that very rite of consecration (or pressing)--and by that he is now consecrated (or pressed)--which this (Sacrificer) is permitted to perform by those deities with whose permission he is consecrated ; for he alone becomes king whom the (other) kings allow (to assume) the royal dignity, and not he whom (they do) not (allow to assume it). Now when he offers in the fire he thereby consecrates (anoints) Agni, and that divine body of his, being consecrated by Soma, becomes consecrated by the nectar of immortality. And he himself drinks (thereof): he thereby consecrateshimself, and this self (body) of his, being consecrated by Soma, becomes consecrated by the nectar of immortality.
4	4	9	Having offered in the fire (or, on the fire-altar), he drinks (Soma), for that (fire-altar) is his (the Sacrificer's) divine body , and this (Sacrificer's real body) is his human one; and the gods indeed were first, and afterwards men: therefore, having offered (Soma) in the fire, he drinks (thereof).
4	4	10	Having now obtained the wish for (the accomplishment of) which he yokes it (the altar), he unyokes it when about to bespeak the Yagñâyagñiya stotra ,--for the Yagñâyagñiya is the heavenly world, and it is for the attainment of that (world) that he yokes it: thus (he unyokes it) after obtaining the wish for which he yoked it.
4	4	11	It is prior to the Stotra that he unyokes it:--were he to unyoke after the Stotra, he would pass beyond that world  and lose it; but when he unyokes prior to the Stotra, he unyokes forthwith after reaching the world of heaven.
4	4	12	He unyokes it on the enclosing-sticks, for itis on the enclosing-sticks that he yokes it, and at whatever place (of the body) people yoke a horse there they also unyoke it.
4	4	13	Having touched it (the fire) at the two joints , he mutters these two formulas,--thus two formulas equal in power three enclosing-sticks,--with , 'The sky's head thou art, the earth's navel, ' on the right, and with , 'On the head of the All dost thou keep standing, ' on the left (joint),--thus with two (verses) containing (the word) 'head,' for this, is indeed its head; and containing (the words) 'in the waters ': that Yagñâyagñiya doubtless is Agni Vaisvânara's chant of praise, and water is (a means of) appeasing,--therefore (he touches them) with two (verses) containing (the words)--'the waters.'
4	4	14	With two (verses) he unyokes it,--two-footed is the Sacrificer, and Agni is the Sacrificer: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus unyokes him. With three (verses) he yokes,--that (makes) five,--the fire-altar consists of five layers, the year (of) five seasons, and Agni isthe year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great is this.
4	4	15	Now, some yoke it (the fire-altar) at a Prâyanîya  Atirâtra, and unyoke it at an Udayanîya, saying, 'The unyoking, surely, is a certain form of completion, and why should we perform a form of completion prior to the completion (of the sacrifice)?' But let him not do this, for day by day this sacrifice is performed, and day by day it comes to completion; day by day he yokes that (altar) for the attainment of the heavenly world, and day by day he thereby attains the heavenly world: let him therefore yoke it day by day, and unyoke it day by day.
4	4	16	And, indeed, it would be just as if, at the Prâyanîya Atirâtra, after reciting the kindling-verses, he were to say, 'Hereafter , at the Udayanîya, I shall recite (them again)!' Let him therefore yoke (the altar) day by day, and unyoke it day by day.
4	4	17	And on this point, Sândilya, indeed, having enjoined on the Kaṅkatîyas the day-by-day performance,went on his way, saying, 'Day by day they shall yoke for you, and day by day they shall unyoke!' Let him therefore yoke day by day, and unyoke day by day.
5	1	1	Now, then, as to the taking of milk as fast-food: the initiated should take milk for his fast-food. Once upon a time the nectar of immortality departed from the gods.
5	1	2	They said, 'Let us seek for it here by toil and penance!' They sought for it by toil and penance. Having become initiated, they were living on fast-milk, for penance it is when, after becoming initiated, one lives on fast-milk. They heard the sound of it.
5	1	3	They said, 'It is indeed coming nearer: let us practise penance still further!' They resorted to three teats: they saw it.
5	1	4	They said, 'It is indeed coming nearer: let us practise penance still further!' They resorted to two teats: they saw it still nearer.
5	1	5	They said, 'It is indeed coming nearer: let us practise penance still further!' They resorted to one teat: it came nigh unto them, but they could not lay hold of it.
5	1	6	They said, 'It has indeed come nigh unto us, but we cannot lay hold of it: let us undergo the whole (practice of) penance!' On the day of preparation they underwent entire abstention from food; for the whole (practice of) penance it is when one abstains from food: let him therefore eat nothing on the day of preparation.
5	1	7	On the morrow, having laid hold of it and pressed it (the Soma), they offered (of it) in the fire,and thereby bestowed immortality upon Agni. And he, Agni (the fire-altar), indeed, is the body of all the gods; and hence, when they bestowed immortality on Agni (the fire-altar), they bestowed immortality on their own selves, and thereby the gods became immortal.
5	1	8	Now that same nectar of immortality is Soma. And even to this day the Sacrificer seeks for it by toil and penance; having become initiated he lives on fast-milk; for penance it is when, after being initiated, one lives on fast-milk; he hears the sound of it, saying, 'On such and such a day the buying (will take place )!'
5	1	9	He resorts to three teats (of the cow): he sees it. He resorts to two teats: he sees it nearer by. He resorts to one teat: it comes nigh to him, but he cannot lay hold of it. He undergoes entire abstinence from food; for the whole (practice of) penance it is when one abstains from food: let him therefore eat nothing on the day of preparation.
5	1	10	And, on the morrow, having laid hold of it, and pressed it, he offers (of it) in the fire, and thereby bestows immortality on Agni. He then drinks (of it), and thereby bestows immortality on his own self, and becomes immortal; for this, assuredly, is immortality to man when he attains the whole (perfect) life: and so, in truth, he attains the whole life by this self of his.
5	1	11	When he has offered in the fire, he drinks (Soma); for that (fire-altar) is his divine body, and this (Sacrificer's own body) is his human one; andthe gods were first, and then men: therefore he drinks (Soma), after offering in the fire.
5	1	12	Now, then, the discussion of the Samishtayagus (oblations): The gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pragâpati, entered upon their father Pragâpati's inheritance, to wit, speech--truth and untruth, both truth and untruth: they, both of them, spake the truth, and they both spake untruth; and, indeed, speaking alike, they were alike.
5	1	13	The gods relinquished untruth, and held fast to truth, and the Asuras relinquished truth, and held fast to untruth.
5	1	14	The truth which was in the Asuras beheld this, and said, 'Verily, the gods have relinquished untruth, and held fast to truth: well, then, I will go thither!' Thus it went over to the gods.
5	1	15	And the untruth which was in the gods beheld this, and said, 'Verily, the Asuras have relinquished truth, and held fast to untruth: well, then, I will go thither!' Thus it went over to the Asuras.
5	1	16	The gods spake nothing but truth, and the Asuras nothing but untruth. And the gods, speaking the truth diligently, were very contemptible, and very poor: whence he who speaks the truth diligently, becomes indeed very contemptible, and very poor; but in the end he assuredly prospers, for the gods indeed prospered.
5	1	17	And the Asuras, speaking untruth diligently, throve even as salt soil , and were very prosperous: whence he who speaks untruth diligently, thrives indeed, even as salt soil, and becomes very prosperous;but in the end he assuredly comes to naught, for the Asuras indeed came to naught.
5	1	18	Now that same truth, indeed, is this threefold lore . The gods said, 'Now that we have made up the sacrifice, let us spread out  this truth!'
5	1	19	They prepared the Initiation-offering. But the Asuras became aware of it, and said, 'Having made up the sacrifice, the gods are now spreading out that truth: come, let us fetch hither what was ours!' The Samishtayagus of that (offering) was not yet performed, when they arrived: whence people offer no Samishtayagus  for that sacrifice. The gods, espying the Asuras, snatched up the sacrifice, and began doing something else . They (the Asuras) went away again, thinking, 'It is something else they are doing.'
5	1	20	When they had gone away, they (the gods) prepared the Opening-offering. But the Asurasbecame aware of this also. The Samyos (formula) of that (offering) had been pronounced, when they arrived; whence that sacrifice ends with the Samyos . The gods, espying the Asuras, snatched up the sacrifice, and began doing something else. They went away again, thinking, 'It is something else they are doing.'
5	1	21	When they had gone away, they (the gods), having bought and driven about the king (Soma), prepared the guest-offering for him. But the Asuras became aware of this also. The Idâ of that (offering) had been invoked, when they arrived; whence that sacrifice ends with the Idâ . The gods, espying the Asuras, snatched up the sacrifice, and began doing something else. They went away again, thinking, 'It is something else they are doing.'
5	1	22	When they had gone away, they (the gods) spread out (performed) the Upasads . When they had recited three kindling-verses, and no more, they made offering to the deities, but laid out  no fore-offerings and no after-offerings on either side of the sacrifice, for they were in too great haste at that time; whence at the Upasads, when he has recited three kindling-verses, and no more, hemakes offering to the deities, but lays out no fore-offerings and no after-offerings on either side of the sacrifice.
5	1	23	On the day of preparation they slaughtered the Agnîshomîya victim. But the Asuras became aware of this also. The Samishtayagus oblations of this (offering) had not yet been offered, when they arrived; whence people offer no Samishtayagus for this animal(-offering). The gods, espying the Asuras, snatched up the sacrifice, and began doing something else. They went away again, thinking, 'It is something else they are doing.'
5	1	24	On the next morning after they had gone away, they (the gods) spread out (performed) the morning-service (of the Soma-sacrifice). But the Asuras became aware of this also. As much as the morning-service had been performed of it, when they arrived. The gods, espying the Asuras, snatched up the sacrifice, and began doing something else. They went away, thinking, 'It is something else they are doing.'
5	1	25	When they had gone, they (the gods) spread out the midday-service. But the Asuras became aware of this also. As much as the midday-service had been performed of it, when they arrived. The gods, espying the Asuras, snatched up the sacrifice, and began doing something else. They went away, thinking, 'It is something else they are doing.'
5	1	26	When they had gone, (the gods) went on with the animal-offering of the Soma-sacrifice . But the Asuras became aware of this also. As much of this animal-offering as is done (at the evening-service) had been done, when they arrived. The gods, espying them, snatched up the sacrifice, and began doing something else. They went away, thinking, 'It is something else they are doing.'
5	1	27	When they had gone away, they (the gods) spread the evening-service and completed it; and by completing it they obtained that whole truth. Then the Asuras went down . Then the gods prevailed, and the Asuras came to naught. And, indeed, he who knows this, himself prevails, and his spiteful enemy comes to naught.
5	1	28	The gods said, 'Those sacrifices of ours which are half-completed, and leaving behind which we went off ,--think ye upon this, how we may complete them!' They said, 'Meditate ye!' whereby, indeed, they meant to say, 'Seek ye how we may complete these sacrifices!'
5	1	29	Whilst meditating, they saw these Samishtayagus (oblations), and offered them, and thereby completed those sacrifices; and inasmuch as thereby they completed (samsthâpaya) them, they are 'samsthitayagus'; and inasmuch as thereby they sacrificed completely (sam-yag ), they are 'samishtayagus.'
5	1	30	Now there are nine such (incomplete) sacrifices,and there are nine samishtayagus-oblations ; and by offering these, he completes those sacrifices. He offers both kinds, those of the Soma-sacrifice, and those of the Agni(-kayana),--first those of the Soma-sacrifice, and afterwards those of the fire-altar: the significance of this has been explained.
5	1	31	Two he offers of the fire-altar,--two-footed is the Sacrificer, and Agni is the Sacrificer: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus completes the sacrifice. , 'Sacrifice hath been offered, up by the Bhrigus . . .;'--'May Agni who hath received sacrifice and oblation speed our offered meat!'
5	1	32	These two amount to eleven,--the Trishtubh consists of eleven syllables, and the Trishtubh means strength: it is strength he thus imparts to the Sacrificer.
5	1	33	And, again, as to why there are eleven,--the Trishtubh consists of eleven syllables, and Indra is of trishtubh nature, Indra is the self (soul) of the sacrifice, Indra is the deity : he thus finally establishes the sacrifice in him who is the self, the deity of the sacrifice.
5	1	34	Having performed the Samishtayagus-oblations, they betake themselves to the expiatory bath (avabhritha ). Having come out from the bath,and performed the Udayanîya (concluding oblation) , he, after the animal cake of the offering of the barren cow , prepares oblations for the goddesses.
5	1	35	For now Pragâpati, having gained his end, thought himself quite perfect. Establishing himself in the quarters he went on ordering (or creating) and disposing everything here; and inasmuch as he went on ordering and disposing, he is the Orderer. And in like manner does the Sacrificer, establishing himself in the quarters, order and dispose everything here.
5	1	36	And, again, as to why he prepares these oblations. This Agni (the fire-altar) is the quarters (regions), and these he lays down beforehand (in the shape of) the bunch of Darbha grass  and the clod-bricks ; the Prânabhrits  in the first layer, the whole of the second, the whole of the third, and the whole of the fourth (layers ); and of the fifthlayer the Asapatnâs, Nâkasads and Pañkakûdâs ,--these kept going out upwards  (from Pragâpati, the altar). Pragâpati was afraid of them, thinking, 'Whilst moving away, these will go beyond this universe.' Having become the Orderer, he went round them and established himself in them.
5	1	37	Now the same as that Orderer is yonder sun; and that which was the farthest gone of the regions is that in which that (sun) shines firmly established.
5	1	38	And the same as that Orderer is this cake to the Orderer on twelve potsherds. On twelve potsherds (it is),--the year is (of) twelve months, Pragâpati is the year, and Pragâpati is the Orderer. And that one which was the farthest gone of the regions is the same as these previous oblations,--a pap to Anumati, a pap to Râkâ, a pap to Sinîvalî, and a pap to Kuhû : when he prepares these oblations, he thereby establishes him (Pragâpati) in that which was the farthest gone of the regions. That (cake) he offers whole, for the completeness of that (Pragâpati).
5	1	39	These are goddesses, for they are the regions,the regions are the metres, and the metres are deities; and that Ka is Pragâpati; and inasmuch as they are goddesses (devî) and Ka, they are 'devikâh .' There are five of them, for there are five regions.
5	1	40	As to this they say, 'He should not offer these oblations, lest he should do what is excessive.' Let him nevertheless offer them; for these oblations are offered for (the fulfilment) of (special) wishes, and in wishes there is nothing excessive. And whatever oblation is offered after the cake of the animal-offering that is placed inside the victim itself as its sacrificial sap. He offers both kinds (of oblations), those of the Soma-sacrifice and those of the Agni(-kayana), to wit, first those of the Soma-sacrifice, and then those of the fire-altar: the significance of this has been explained. The cake-offering of the animal sacrifice is (performed) in a loud voice, and these (five oblations) in a low voice, for they are an ishti . With the Pasupurodâsa he (the Adhvaryu) says, 'Recite!--Urge!' and with these (oblations), 'Recite!--Worship!' for they are an ishti . There is the same Svishtakrit, and the same Idâ .
5	1	41	Of that same animal-offering (of the barren cow) they perform the Samishtayagus-oblations; they enter the expiatory bath with the heart-spit ;for this animal-offering is the end. Having proceeded with the heart-spit;--
5	1	42	And having returned (to the fire-altar), he performs the oblations to Visvakarman;--This Agni(-kayana) indeed (includes) all sacrificial rites (visvâni karmâni); and all these its rites have been performed in this (agnikayana): he now gratifies them, and makes them a deity by means of an offering of sacrificial food; for only that one is a deity, for whom an oblation is prepared, but not one for whom it is not (prepared). Moreover, this Agni is Visvakarman (the all-worker): it is him he thereby gratifies.
5	1	43	And, again, as to why he offers the Vaisvakarmana (oblations) . For the fire-altar there is both a beginning and an end: the Sâvitra  (formulas) are the beginning, and the Vaisvakarmana (oblations) the end. Were he to offer only those to Savitri, and not those to Visvakarman, it would be as if he made only a beginning and no end; and were he to offer only those to Visvakarman, and not those to Savitri, it would be as if he made only an end and no beginning. He offers both of them, and thus makes both a beginning and an end.
5	1	44	There are eight of those (Sâvitra), and so (there are eight of) these: thus he makes the end(the same) as the beginning. The Svâhâ-call is the ninth of those , and so it is of these: thus he makes the end as the beginning. The oblation (âhuti) is the tenth of those , and so it is of these: thus he makes the end as the beginning. On that occasion he offers the oblation continuously so as not to stop the seed, the sacrifice there being seed;--on this occasion (he offers) with the dipping-spoon at the Svâhâ-call, for manifest is the seed when it is born.
5	1	45	, 'What hath flowed from out of the will, or the heart, or was gathered from the mind, or the eye, after that go ye forward,--to the world of the righteous whither the first-born seers went of old!' he thereby means those Rishis .
5	1	46	'Unto thee, O (heavenly) seat, I commit this treasure which the knower of beings shall bring thither ! Here the lord of the sacrifice will go after you: acknowledge ye  him in the highest heaven!'--as the text, so the meaning.
5	1	47	'Acknowledge him, O ye gods, seatedin the highest heaven, know ye his form! When he cometh by the godward paths, reveal ye unto him the fulfilment of his wishes!'--as the text, so the meaning.--'Awake, O Agni, and be watchful! . . .'--'Whereby thou carriest a thousand, . . .'--the meaning of these two has been explained .
5	1	48	'With grass-bunch and enclosing-stick, with spoon, altar-ground and grass-cover, with verse of praise, lead thou this our sacrifice unto heaven, to go unto the gods!' that is, 'with these outward forms of our sacrifice make it go to the heavenly world!'
5	1	49	'What gift, what bounty, what fulfilment, what offering-presents there are of ours,--Agni Vaisvakarmana shall deposit them in heaven with the gods!'--that is, 'whatever we give, seasonably or unseasonably, that this fire-altar of Visvakarman shall place in the heavenly world!'
5	1	50	'Where the streams of honey and ghee are never-failing,--there, in heaven, Agni Vaisvakarmana shall place us with the gods!'--as the text, so the meaning .
5	1	51	Eight Vaisvakarmana (oblations) he offers,--the Gâyatrî consists of eight syllables, and Agni is of Gâyatra nature: as great as Agni is, as greatas is his measure, by so much food he thus gratifies him.
5	1	52	When he has performed the Vaisvakarmana (oblations), he gives a name  (to the fire of the altar); for when any one has been born sound and safe, they give a name to him, and now this (Agni) has indeed been born sound and safe.
5	1	53	Having given a name to him, he reverently approaches him; for this (Sacrificer) builds him with his (own) whole self, and were he not to give utterance now to this surrender of his own self, he (Agni) would now take away his (the Sacrificer's) self; but when he now gives utterance to this surrender of his own self, he (Agni) does not take away his self.  with the Anushtubh verse , 'What fires of the five races of men there are upon this earth,--thou art the chiefest of them: quicken us unto life!'--the Anushtubh, doubtless, is speech, and all the metres are speech : he thus makes amends to him (Agni) by all the metres. Having stood by the fire, and lifted  it, and churned it out, he offers the completing oblation .
5	1	54	He then offers a dish of clotted curds to Mitra and Varuna . Now he who performs this (Agni-kayana) rite comes to be with the gods; and these two, Mitra and Varuna, are a divine pair. Now, were he to have intercourse with a human woman without having offered this (oblation), it would be a descent, as if one who is divine would become human; but when he offers this dish of clotted curds to Mitra and Varuna, he thereby approaches a divine mate : having offered it, he may freely have intercourse in a befitting way.
5	1	55	And, again, as to why he offers this dish of clotted curds to Mitra and Varuna. When Pragâpati was released, the seed fell from him. When the gods restored him, they, by means of this dish of clotted curds, put seed into him; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) thereby put seed into him.
5	1	56	Now that Pragâpati who became released is this very fire-altar which is here being built; and the seed which fell from him is this dish of clotted curds of Mitra and Varuna; for Mitra and Varuna are the in-breathing and up-breathing, and the in-breathing and up-breathing fashion the infused seed. A dish of clotted curds it is, because seed is milk; and sacrifice it is, because sacrifice is the seed of sacrifice. In a low voice it is (offered), for silently seed is shed. At the end (of the sacrifice) it is (offered), for from the end seed is introduced.
5	1	57	They proceed with the whey  of that (dish of clotted curds). At this (oblation of whey) he gives a dakshinâ (sacrificial gift): 'Let him give a pair of hornless he-goats,' so (they say);--'Only by assignment, I think :' said Mâhitthi. And, verily, this libation of the fire-builder flows away as a libation of Soma which one offers on a (fire) without bricks.
5	1	58	He need only lay down the naturally-perforated (bricks) ; for the naturally-perforated ones are these worlds; and this built fire-altar is the same as these worlds.
5	1	59	He need only lay down the seasonal (bricks); for the seasonal ones are the year, and this built fire-altar is the year.
5	1	60	He need only lay down the all-light (bricks); for the all-light (bricks) are those deities , and this built fire-altar is those deities.
5	1	61	He need only lay down the Punaskiti; for this is a repeated sacrifice (punar-yagña), it is a later (higher) worship of the gods: it is thus a repeated sacrifice and the higher worship of the gods he thereby arranges, and the repeated sacrifice inclines to him !--so (they say), but let him not do this,for, indeed, whenever Agni is placed on the built (altar), this whole Agni passes into that very brick : thus whenever he offers in the fire, then these oblations of his will be offered even as would be his oblations, when offered on a complete Sândila fire-altar built up with wings and tail.
5	1	62	And, indeed, he who carries about Agni  becomes pregnant with all beings, and with all the gods; and he who builds him when he has not been carried about for a year kills all beings in the form of an embryo. But, surely, he who kills a human embryo, is despised, how much more then he who kills him (Agni), for he is a god: 'Let no one become an officiating priest for an (Agni) who has not been carried about for a year,' said Vâtsya, 'lest he should be a participator in the killing of this, a god's seed !'
5	1	63	'A six-month (Agni) is the last  he may build,' they say, 'for six-month embryos are the last  that live when born.' If he were to recite the Great Litany on one not carried for a year, he should recite (only) the eighties of verses, for something incomplete is (the Agni) not carried for a year, and something incomplete are the eighties of verses . But, indeed, he would only still further pull asunder that (Agni, already) pulled asunder ; and, indeed, whether he (Agni) be carried for a year, or not carried for a year, he (the Hotri) should recite the whole of the Great Litany.
5	1	64	Now Sândilyâyana was once upon a time sojourning in the eastern region. Daiyâmpâti said to him, 'Sândilyâyana, how is Agni to be built? For, indeed, we are loth to carry him for a year, and yet we wish to build him.'
5	1	65	He said, 'Let him by all means build him by whom he has previously been carried for a year; for that, that (Agni) alone He builds as one that has been carried  (as a child in the womb).'
5	1	66	And, indeed, let him by all means build whointends to press Soma for a year, for he, manifestly, supports him by food (in the shape of) those libations.
5	1	67	And, indeed, let him by all means build who offers the Agnihotra for a year, for he who offers the Agnihotra indeed supports him (Agni, the fire).
5	1	68	And, indeed, let him by all means build who was born a year (after conception); for Agni is the breath; it is thus him (Agni) he holds. And, indeed, as the breath, he enters into the infused seed, and takes possession of it; and inasmuch as he takes possession (vid) of every one that is born (gâta), he is Gâtavedas. Wherefore by all means let even one who knows this build him as one ever carried (within him). And, indeed, if one who knows this either drinks (Soma), or offers drink to any one else, these libations of his will be offered even as would be his libations, when offered on a complete Sândila fire-altar built up with wings and tail.
5	2	1	Indra saw this seven-versed (hymn, suitable) for making good what is deficient , for reducing what is redundant, and for perfecting what is imperfect. And, indeed, after building the fire-altar, one is (still) apt to get into trouble, or to stumble, or what not. Now, when Syâparna Sâyakâyana heard this, he ventured upon this performance.
5	2	2	Now, there is here a perfecting of three things,--the perfecting of the fire-altar, the perfecting ofhim who has it built for him, and the perfecting of him who builds it.
5	2	3	Thus, when he reverently stands by (the altar) with this (hymn), everything is thereby made good  for him that, knowing or unknowing, he either does in excess, or does not carry to the end, in this building of the altar--in short, whatever was not secured for him. And whatever wish there is in that anushtubh verse , that he secures even now; and, moreover, he thereby keeps off the fiends, the Rakshas, from this sacred work, and they do not wreck him, whilst uttering imprecations. Wherefore one who knows this may readily build a fire-altar even for an enemy, for he is able to gain the better of him.
5	2	4	, 'For mighty strength that smiteth Vritra, and for victory in battle, we call thee hither, O Indra!' 'O much-invoked Indra, crush thou the handless Kunâru, lurking here, together with the Dânus; and with might smite thou the footless Vritra, the ever-growing mocker!' thus he reverently stands by (the fire) with the first two (verses) relating to the slaying of Vritra. For now the gods, having warded off Vritra, evil, performed this rite freed from evil; and in like manner does the Sacrificer, having warded off Vritra, evil, now perform this rite freed from evil.
5	2	5	'Scatter thou our scorners, O Indra !'Like a terrible, creeping beast, dwelling in the mountains, hast thou come from the farthest distance: having sharpened thy pointed, piercing thunderbolt , O Indra, beat thou off the foes, and scatter the spurners!' thus with the second two (verses) relating to (Indra) Vimridh . For now the gods, having warded off the spurners, evil, performed this rite freed from evil; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now, having warded off the spurners, evil, now perform this rite freed from evil.
5	2	6	'May Agni Vaisvânara come forward from afar to our help, to hear our hymns of praise!'--'Sought after in the sky, sought after on earth, Agni, sought after, hath entered all the plants: Agni Vaisvânara, sought after, may guard us from injury by day and by night!' thus with the third two (verses) relating to (Agni) Vaisvânara. For now the gods, having, by Vaisvânara, burnt out evil, performed this rite, freed from evil; and in like manner does the . Sacrificer now, by Vaisvânara, burn out evil, and perform this rite freed from evil.
5	2	7	'May we obtain this wish, O Agni, with thy help! may we obtain, O wealthy one, wealth with abundant heroes! striving for strength, may we obtain strength; may we obtain undecaying glory, O thou ever-young!' thus with one (verse) containing wishes. For nowthe gods, having, by the six-versed (hymn), warded off evil, made once for all, by the one wish-holding (verse), all (objects of) wishes their own; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now, having, by the six-versed (hymn), warded off evil, make once for all, by the one wish-holding (verse), all wishes his own.
5	2	8	It is (a hymn) of seven verses,--the fire-altar consists of seven layers, (and there are) seven seasons, seven regions, seven worlds of the gods, seven stomas, seven prishtha (sâmans), seven metres, seven domestic animals, seven wild ones, seven vital airs in the head, and whatever else there is of seven kinds, relating to deities and relating to the self,--all that he thereby secures. They become equal to the Anushtubh , for the Anushtubh is speech, and it is by speech that he secures for him (Agni) all that which is not yet secured for him.
5	2	9	'Let him approach (the fire-altar) with an eight-versed (hymn)!' say some;--'with , "We thereby offer unto thee thy wish, reverently approaching thee with open hands: with holiest mind and peaceful thought offer thou sacrifice unto the gods as priest, O Agni!" thus with a second wish-holding one,--and the seven foregoing ones, that makes eight,--the Gâyatrî consists of eight syllables, and Agni is of Gâyatra nature: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus secures for himwhatsoever is not yet secured for him; and thus, moreover, the two deities  receive the same (amount) for their share.' Let him, however, not do so, for surely those seven (verses) are (equal to) eight anushtubh (verses), and thus he even therein obtains whatever wished-for object there is in the eight-versed (hymn).
5	2	10	With (verses) addressed to Indra and Agni he approaches (the fire);--the fire-altar belongs to Indra and Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus gains for him whatever has not been gained for him. And Indra and Agni are all the gods, and the fire-altar belongs to (or Agni is) all the deities: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus gains for him whatever has not been gained for him.
5	2	11	Now some make this (hymn) the opening rite of every performance, saying, 'Freed from evil, we must perform this sacred work!' And others, indeed, say, 'Let him approach reverently (each) layer when it is covered with soil, for therein that (layer) becomes whole and complete.' Let him, then, do as he chooses. So much as to the building; now as to the non-building.
5	2	12	Verily, there are three oceans,--the Fire-altar (being the ocean) of Yagus-formulas, the Mahâvrata (-sâman)  that of Sâmans (hymn-tunes), and the Mahad uktham (Great Litany ) that of Rik (verses). Whoever performs these (three rites) for anotherperson causes these oceans to dry up for himself, and after them, thus drying up, the metres  dry up for him; and after the metres the world; and after the world his own self; and after his own self his children and cattle: indeed, he who performs these for another person becomes poorer day after day.
5	2	13	And he who, not having performed these (rites) for another person, were to officiate in the performance even of all other sacrifices, for him the metres again replenish themselves from out of those oceans, and after the metres the world, and after the world his own self, and after his own self his children and cattle: indeed, he who does not perform those rites for another person, becomes more prosperous day after day. For, indeed, these (rites) are his divine, immortal body; and he who performs them for another person, makes over to another his divine body, and a withered trunk is all that remains.
5	2	14	Now, some (say), 'Having performed them for another person, they either perform them for themselves or cause them to be performed again: this is the atonement.' But let him not do this, for it would be as if one were to water a withered trunk; it would rot and die: let him know that there is no atonement for such an one.
5	2	15	And Sândilya once upon a time said--Tura Kâvasheya once built a fire-altar for the gods at Kârotî. The gods asked him, 'Sage, seeing that they declare the building of the fire-altar not to be conducive to heaven, why then hast thou built one?'
5	2	16	He said, 'What is conducive to heaven,and what is not conducive thereto? The Sacrificer is the body of the sacrifice, and the officiating priests are the limbs; and, surely, where the body is there are the limbs; and where the limbs are there is the body. And, verily, if the priests have no place in heaven, then the Sacrificer has none, for both are of the same world. But let there be no bargaining as to sacrificial fees, for by bargaining the priests are deprived of their place in heaven.'
