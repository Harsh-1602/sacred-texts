1	1	1	Being about to build the Gârhapatya (fire-place), he sweeps (its site) with a Palâsa (butea frondosa) branch. For when he builds the Gârhapatya  he settles on that place; and whatsoever builders of fire-altars (there have been), they are indeed settled on this earth; and when he sweeps (that place) he thereby sweeps away those settled (there before hire), thinking, 'Lest I should settle on those already settled (here).'
1	1	2	'Off with you! away with you! crawl away from here !'--that is, 'Go off, go away, and crawl away from here!' he says this to those that crawl on their belly;--'Ye that are here of old and of late!' that is, 'both ye who were here of yore, and ye of the present day.'
1	1	3	'Yama hath given the settlement on earth (to this Sacrificer);'--for Yama indeed rules over the settling on this earth, and it is he who grants to this (Sacrificer) a settlement on this earth.
1	1	4	'The Fathers have prepared this place for him!' for Yama is the Kshatra (nobility, or ruling power), and the Fathers (deceased ancestors) are the clansmen; and to whomsoever the chief (kshatriya), with the approval of the clan, grants a settlement, that (settlement) is properly given: and in like manner does Yama, the ruling power, with the consent of the Fathers, the clan, now grant to this (Sacrificer) a settlement on this earth.
1	1	5	With a palâsa branch he sweeps; for the Palâsa tree is the Brahman : it is by the Brahman he thus sweeps away those already settled;--with a prayer (he does so), for the prayer is the Brahman: it is by the Brahman he thus sweeps away those already settled. He throws it (the branch) out towards the north .
1	1	6	He then scatters saline soil (over the hearth-site); for the Gârhapatya is this world, and salt means cattle: he thus bestows cattle on this world,--hence those cattle here in this world.
1	1	7	And again why he scatters saline soil. Pragâpati created creatures; he created them with different kinds of amnions: they did not agree together. He desired, 'May they agree together!' He made them to be of the same (kind of) amnion: hence even to this day, being of equal amnions, they agree together. And he who offers, offers thinking, 'May I be (born) with the same (kind of) amnion as the gods!' and when he scatters saline salt (in the hearth-site) he thereby becomes of equal amnion with the gods.
1	1	8	'Concord thou art!' for thereby they agreed together ;--'fulfilment of desire;' for salt is cattle, and fulfilment of desire means cattle;--'In me may there be the fulfilment of thy desire!' that is, 'May there be on me cattle for thee!'--He covers with it the whole (circular) Gârhapatya; for the Gârhapatya altar is the womb, and the saline soil is the amnion: he thus covers the whole womb with the amnion.
1	1	9	He then scatters sand to keep (the saline soil, or amnion) from being scorched ;--for sand is nothing else than the ashes of Agni Vaisvânara, and him, Agni Vaisvânara, he is indeed about to build up; and Agni does not scorch his own self.
1	1	10	And again why he scatters sand,--sand is nothing else than the seed of Agni Vaisvânara , and him, Agni Vaisvânara, he is about to build up; but nothing is fashioned from out of the seedless: 'May he (Agni) be fashioned from out of this seed!' so he thinks.
1	1	11	'Agni's ashes thou art! Agni's soil thou art!' for Agni's ashes are useless, and the sand is not useless: he thus makes it (the Gârhapatya hearth) to be useful. He covers with it the whole Gârhapatya; for the Gârhapatya altar is the womb, and the sand is seed: he thus fills the whole womb with seed.
1	1	12	He then encloses it with enclosing-stones; for the enclosing-stones are the womb: he thus encloses the seed here cast in the womb; and hence the seed which is cast is enclosed in the womb.
1	1	13	And, again, why he encloses it with enclosing-stones;--the Gârhapatya hearth is this (terrestrial) world, and the enclosing-stones are the waters: he thus surrounds this world with water,--it is with the ocean that he thus surrounds it on all sides, and hence the ocean flows round this world on all sides. (He puts up the stones) by turning to the right (or south) , whence the ocean flows round this world (from the east) southwards;--by means of a dug out (hole, or moat) , whence the ocean flows round this world in a moat.
1	1	14	'Ranging ye are!' for he does range them;--'ranging around ye are!' for he does range them all round;--'upwards ranging get ye fixed!' thus he says, placing them upright: hence the ocean surges upwards; but were he to place them sideways, the ocean surely would all at once overflow all this (earth). He does not settle them, for unsettled are the waters; nor does he pronounce the Sûdadohas (verse) on them .
1	1	15	For the enclosing-stones are the bones, and the Sûdadohas is the breath; and there is no breath in the bones. With one and the same formula he lays down many bricks , for of one and the same form are the waters; and as to there being many enclosing-stones, it is because there are many waters.
1	1	16	The enclosing-stones, then, are the womb; the saline earth is the amnion, and the sand is the seed. The enclosing-stones are outside, and the saline earth is inside; for the womb is outside, and the amnion inside. The saline earth is outside, and the sand inside; for the amnion is outside, and the seed inside. He who is born is born from these: it is from them that he thus causes him (Agni) to be born.
1	1	17	Thereon he now builds it (the hearth): he
GÂRHAPATYA HEARTH.thereby fashions that infused seed; and hence the infused seed is fashioned in the womb.
1	1	18	He puts on (the circular site) four (bricks) running eastwards ; two behind running crosswise (from south to north), and two (such) in front. Now the four which he puts on running eastwards are the body; and as to there being four of these, it is because this body (of ours) consists, of four parts . The two at the back then are the thighs; and the two in front the arms; and where the body is that (includes) the head.
1	1	19	Now he here fashions him (Agni) with wings and tail; for whatlike the seed is fashioned in the womb suchlike (offspring) is born: thus inasmuch as he now fashions him with wings and tail, he is born hereafter  with wings and tail.
1	1	20	While being indeed furnished with wings and tail, people do not see him as one having wings and tail : hence one does not see the child in the womb in its proper shape; but hereafter they (will) see him as one having wings and tail, and hence one sees the child after it is born in its proper shape.
1	1	21	Four (bricks) he puts on first, for of him thatis being produced it is the body (trunk) that is produced first. Sitting south (of the hearth-site) with his face to the north he puts on first one (brick) of the upper (north) part  (of the trunk); and in this manner that Agni of his comes to be built up towards (or for the Sacrificer) himself.
1	1	22	'This is the Agni wherein Indra taketh the Soma-juice,' for the Gârhapatya hearth is this (terrestrial) world, and the Soma-juice is the waters: Indra thus took up the waters in this world;--'into his belly, craving it,'--for the belly is the centre;--'thousandfold strength, like a swift racer,'--the thousandfold strength, doubtless, is the waters,--'thou, having gained, art exalted, O knower of beings!' that is, 'thou, being built, art built , O knower of beings!'
1	1	23	'O Agni, what splendour is thine in the heaven,'--his splendour in the heaven doubtless is the sun;--'on earth,' that on earth is this fire;--'and that which is in the plants, in the waters, O holy one!' he thereby means the fire that is both in the plants, and in the waters;--'wherewith thou hast overspread the wide air,'--that is, the wind;--'brilliant is that light, surging, man-viewing;' that is, 'great is that light, surging, man-viewing.'
1	1	24	'O Agni,thou goest up to the flood of the heaven;' the flood of that heaven doubtless is the waters (of the atmosphere): to them he goes by his smoke;--'hither callest thou the divine inspirers,'--the divine inspirers doubtless are the vital airs, for these inspire all thoughts;--'the waters approach (thee), they that are beyond the luminous sphere of the sun, and they that are below here;'--the luminous sphere doubtless is that world yonder where that (sun) is burning: he thereby means both the waters which are beyond, and those which are below that (sun).
1	1	25	'The Agnis Purîshyas,'--that is, the Agnis favourable to cattle; 'together with those of the streams (prâvana);' this is a form of starting  (prâyana), for the Gârhapatya is indeed a starting of the fire;--'may they, benevolent, accept the sacrifice, the copious, salutary draughts!' that is, 'may they benevolently accept the sacrifice, the copious, innocuous draughts!'
1	1	26	He puts them down separately: what different desires there are, those he thereby lays into the self. He 'settles' them once: he thereby makes the self one. He pronounces the Sûdadohas  verse on them; for the Sûdadohas is the vital air: by means of the vital air he thus makes him (Agni) continuous, joins him together.
1	1	27	Thereupon going round behind, he sits down on the north side with his face to the south, and puts on first the southern one of the two behind,with , 'Potent nourishment, O Agni, the possession of kine,'--nourishment means cattle: he thus invokes for him the blessing of cattle;--'Grant thou perpetually unto him that calleth!'--he that calls doubtless is the Sacrificer; 'May there be to us a son, the perpetuator of the race,'--a son means offspring;--'let that, O Agni, be thy good-will unto us!' he therewith invokes a blessing.
1	1	28	Then the northern one, with , 'This is thy natural womb, whence born thou shonest forth,'--that is, 'this (householder's hearth) is thy primeval, perennial womb (birth-place), whence born thou wert enkindled;'--'knowing it, ascend, O Agni, and increase our substance!' as the text, so its meaning.
1	1	29	These two are his (Agni's) thighs,--separately he puts them on, separately he 'settles' them, separately he pronounces the Sûdadohas verse upon them, for separate are these two thighs. There are two of them, for there are two thighs. Behind he puts them on, for behind are those thighs. At their upper ends they are joined (to the central ones ), for so are these thighs joined (to the body) at their upper ends.
1	1	30	Thereupon, going round again by the same way, he sits down on the south side, with his face to the north, and puts on first the northern one of the two (bricks) in front, with , 'Ranging thou art: by that deity, Aṅgiras-like, lie thou steady !' Then the southern one, with, 'Ranging round thou art: by that deity, Aṅgiras-like, lie thou steady'!'
1	1	31	These two are his (Agni's) arms,--separately he puts them on, separately he 'settles' them, separately he pronounces the Sûdadohas  verse on them; for separate are these two arms. There are two of them, for there are two arms. He puts them on in the forepart, for these arms are here in front. At their upper ends they are joined (to the central ones), for so are these two arms joined (to the body) at the upper ends. Those two (arms) he puts on thus (from north to south), and those two (thighs) thus (from south to north): that is (from east to) southward , for thus it is with the gods .
1	1	32	Eight bricks he puts on (the hearth-site),the Gâyatrî consists of eight syllables, and Agni is Gâyatra : as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great he thus builds him. Five times he 'settles' (the bricks)--the fire-altar consists of five layers; five seasons are a year, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure,so great he thus builds him. Eight bricks he 'settles' five times, that makes thirteen,--thirteen months are a year, and there are thirteen layers of earth in the fire-altar: as great as Agni is, as great .as is his measure, so great does this become.
1	1	33	He then puts on a space-filling one: the significance of that one (will be explained) further on . Three there are in front ,--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great he thus builds him;--and ten those that follow ,--the significance of these (will be explained) further on. Or first two, then ten, and then one, for in this way they build up the pile,--these amount to thirteen: the significance of this has been told.
1	1	34	Both these kinds (of bricks) amount to twenty-one;--there are twelve months, five seasons, these three worlds, and yonder sun as the twenty-first: that sun he thus establishes in this fire-altar.
1	1	35	Moreover, there are twenty-one enclosing-stones,--twelve months, five seasons, these three worlds, and that Agni from yonder (sun)  as the twenty-first: this Agni he thus establishes in yonder sun. And inasmuch as he puts on those (bricks) in this way, he thereby establishes those two (the sun and the fire) in each other, and (accordingly) those two are established in each other; for both of them he now makes out to be the twenty-first, and bothof them are then here , as the Âhavanîya and the Gârhapatya.
1	1	36	He then throws thereon a layer of earth,--the significance of this (will be told) further on . He takes it from the edge of the pit (Kâtvâla); for the Kâtvâla is the same as Agni , and in this way does that which is of Agni's nature become his. It (the Gârhapatya altar) should be even with the mouth (of the fire-pan): the significance of this has been told .
1	1	37	It (the Gârhapatya hearth) measures a fathom (in diameter ), for man is a fathom high, and man is Pragâpati (the lord of generation), and Pragâpati is Agni: he thus makes the womb of equal size to his (Agni's) body. It is circular, for the womb is circular; and moreover the Gârhapatya is this (terrestrial) world, and this world doubtless is circular.
1	1	38	He then pours those two (fires) together ,--he thereby establishes concord between them--with , 'Unite ye two, and get ye on together, loving, radiant, well-disposed, dwelling together for food and drink!--Together have I brought your minds, together your rites, together your thoughts: O Agni Purîshya , be thou the overlord, and bestow thou food and drink upon our Sacrificer!--O Agni, thou art the Purîshya, wealthy, prosperous: having made happy all the regions, seat thee here in thine own seat!--Be ye two unto us of one mind, of one thought, without guile! Injure ye not the sacrifice, nor the lord of the sacrifice, and be ye propitious unto us this day, ye knowers of beings!' He therewith pacifies them for (mutual) safety, so that they shall do no injury to one another.
1	1	39	With four (verses) he pours them together,--he thereby establishes concord between them by whatever four-footed cattle there are; and cattle being food, it is by means of food that he establishes concord between them.
1	1	40	Let him not look at that (pan) while empty: 'I must not look at the empty one!' so he thinks. Were he to look at the empty (pan), it would certainly devour him.
1	1	41	He then pours sand into it , for sand (sikatâ) isthe seed of Agni Vaisvânara: he thus pours (sic) Agni Vaisvânara as seed into it. It should be even with the brim: the significance of this has been explained.
1	1	42	He then unlooses it, to keep it from chafing; for if that which is yoked is not unloosed it is chafed. Now when yoked there, it (the fire-pan) bore this Agni within it as seed, and him it has now brought forth. It now conceives a second time; for the 'Ukhâ' is a female, and hence when a female has brought forth the seed the first time, it conceives a second time.
1	1	43	'Even as a mother her son, so hath the Earth borne Agni Purîshya,'--that is, Agni, favourable to cattle;--'she, the Ukhâ, in her own womb;' that is, the Ukhâ has borne Agni in her own womb;--'May Pragâpati, the all-former, release her, in concert with the All-gods, the seasons!' the All-gods doubtless are the seasons: thus Pragâpati, the all-former, releases it, in concert with the All-gods, the seasons. He deposits it north of the fire, at a cubit's distance: the significance of this has been explained .
1	1	44	He then pours milk into it,--it first receives seed, and now it receives milk; for the fire-pan is a female: hence when a female receives seed, then it receives milk. The sand is below, and the milk above, for the seed is below, and the milk above. He pours it into the middle, so that thereon he may place the human head .
1	2	1	Pragâpati produced creatures. Having produced creatures, and run the whole race, he became relaxed . From him, when relaxed, the vital air went out from within: then his vigour went out of him. That having gone out, he fell down. From him, thus fallen, food flowed forth: it was from that eye on which he lay that his food flowed. And, verily, there teas then no firm foundation whatever here.
1	2	2	The gods spake, 'Verily, there is no other foundation than this: let us restore even him, our father Pragâpati; he shall be our foundation.'
1	2	3	They said unto Agni, 'Verily, there is no foundation other than this: in thee we will restore this our father Pragâpati; he shall be our foundation.'--'What will then be my reward?' said he.
1	2	4	They spake, 'This Pragâpati is food: with thee for our mouth we will eat that food, and he (Pragâpati) shall be the food of us, having thee for our month.' He said, 'So be it!' Therefore the gods eat food with Agni as their mouth; for to whatsoever deity men offer, it is into Agni that they offer, since it is with Agni for their mouth that the gods thus took in the food.
1	2	5	Now the vital air which went out from within him is no other than the wind that blows yonder; and the vigour which went out of him is yonder sun; and the food which flowed from him is all the food which there is within the year.
1	2	6	The gods heated him in the fire; and when thefire rose over him thus heated, that same vital air which had gone out from within him came back to him, and they put it into him; and the vigour which had gone out of him they put into him; and the food which had flowed from him they put into him. Having made him up entire and complete, they raised him (so as to stand) upright; and inasmuch as they thus raised him upright he is these worlds.
1	2	7	This (terrestrial) world truly is his foundation; and what fire there is in this world that is his (Pragâpati's) downward vital air. And the air is his body, and what wind there is in the air, that is that vital air of his in the body. And the sky is his head; the sun and the moon are his eyes. The eye on which he lay is the moon: whence that one is much closed up, for the food flowed therefrom.
1	2	8	Now that same foundation which the gods thus restored is the foundation here even to this day, and will be so even hereafter.
1	2	9	And the Pragâpati who became relaxed is this same Agni who is now being built up. And when that fire-pan lies there empty before being heated, it is just like Pragâpati, as he lay there with the vital air and the vigour gone out of him, and the food having flowed out.
1	2	10	He heats it on the fire, even as the gods then heated him (Pragâpati). And when the fire rises over it thus heated, then that same vital air which went out from within him comes back to him, and he puts it into him. And when, putting on the gold plate, he wears it, he puts into him that very vigour which had gone out of him. And when he puts on kindling-sticks, he puts into him that very food which had flowed from him.
1	2	11	He puts them on in the evening and morning, for the food both of the day and the night was flowing out. These same (ceremonies) should be (performed) during a whole year, for that Pragâpati whence those (substances) went out is the year: into that whole (Pragâpati) he thus puts all that (which belongs to him). And in whatever part of this (year) he should therefore  not do so, into that part of him (Pragâpati) he would not put that (which belongs therein). 'One must not even be a looker-on at the (building up of a fire) not carried about for a year,' Vâmakakshâyana was wont to say, 'lest he should see this our father Pragâpati being torn to pieces .' He restores him so as to be whole and complete, and raises him to stand upright, even as the gods then raised him.
1	2	12	This (terrestrial) world in truth is his (Pragâpati's) Gârhapatya (hearth); and what fire there is in this world that to him is the fire on the Gârhapatya. And what space there is between the Âhavanîya and the Gârhapatya, that is the air ; and that wind inthe air is for him the fire on the Âgnîdhrîya. The sky is his Âhavanîya (hearth), and those two, the sun and the moon, are the fire on the Âhavanîya. This then is indeed his own self .
1	2	13	The Âhavanîya truly is his head; and the fire which is on the Âhavanîya is that vital air of his in the head. And as to why it (the Âhavanîya) has wings and tail, it is because that vital air in the head has wings and tail ;--the eye is its head, the right ear its right wing, the left ear its left wing, the vital air its central body , and the voice is the tail (and) the foundation (the feet): inasmuch as the vital airs subsist by eating food with speech (voice) , the voice is the tail, the foundation.
1	2	14	And what space there is between the Âhavanîya and Gârhapatya, that is the body (trunk); and the fire on the Âgnîdhrîya is to him that vital air inside the body. The Gârhapatya is his foundation; and the fire on the Gârhapatya is his downward vital air.
1	2	15	Now some build it (the Gârhapatya) in three layers, saying, 'There are here three downward vital airs.' Let him not do so: they who do so do what is excessive,--one amounting to twenty-one, one amounting to the Anushtubh, and one amounting to the Brihatî; for this (altar) is of one single form--awomb. And as to those downward vital airs, they are indeed a bringing forth, for even the urine and faeces he voids are 'brought forth.'
1	2	16	Now then the (mystic) correspondence,--twenty-one bricks, nine formulas , that makes thirty;--and the 'settling' and Sûdadohas verse, that makes thirty-two,--the anushtubh verse consists of thirty-two syllables: this is an anushtubh .
1	2	17	And, again, there are twenty-one enclosing-stones; the formula the twenty-second; the formula for the sweeping, the saline earth and its formula, the sand and its formula, the filling (soil) and its formula; with four (formulas) he pours (the two fires) together; with a fifth he unties (the pan); then this (Nirriti) with three ,--the anushtubh verse consists of thirty-two syllables: this then is an anushtubh.
1	2	18	Then there are these two formulas , and they are indeed an anushtubh--the Anushtubh is speech: thus what twofold form of speech there is, the divine and the human, loud and low, that is those two.
1	2	19	The Gârhapatya pile thus is those threeanushtubh verses. And as to why they make up three anushtubhs in this (Gârhapatya), it is because all these (three) worlds then come to be (contained) therein. From it they take one of the two (first) anushtubhs of thirty-two syllables (to be) the Âhavanîya,--that Âhavanîya is that sky, that head (of Pragâpati). Then one of the two (anushtubhs) is left here (to be) this Gârhapatya, this foundation, this very (terrestrial) world.
1	2	20	And as to those two formulas, they are that space between the Âhavanîya and the Gârhapatya, that air (-world), that body (of Pragâpati). And because there are two of them (making up one anushtubh), therefore that space (and hearth) between the Âhavanîya and the Gârhapatya (viz. the Âgnîdhrîya hearth ) is smaller; and therefore the air-world is the smallest of these worlds.
1	2	21	That same Anushtubh, speech, is threefold. That fire, taking the form of the vital air, goes along with it (speech),--the fire which is on the Âhavanîya (altar) is the out-breathing, and yonder sun; and the fire which is on the Âgnîdhrîya is the through-breathing, and the wind which blows yonder; and the fire which is on the Gârhapatya is the in-breathing, and what fire there is here in this (earth-) world. And verily he who knows this makes up for himself the whole Vâk (speech), the whole vital air, the whole body (of Pragâpati).
1	2	22	Then that Brihatî (metre),--the two (verses) of thirty-two syllables: that makes thirty-two; then those two formulas: that makes thirty-four; Agni the thirty-fifth;--a metre does not vanish by a syllable (too much or too little), neither by one nor by two ;--moreover, that (Agni) consists of two syllables: that makes thirty-six. The Brihatî consists of thirty-six syllables,--it is the Brihatî that that (Âhavanîya) pile thus amounts to; for whatlike the seed which is infused into the womb, suchlike (offspring) is born therefrom: thus in that he makes up that Brihatî (metre) in this (Gârhapatya hearth), thereby that (Âhavanîya) fire-altar amounts to the Brihatî.
1	2	23	As to this they say, 'As the Gârhapatya is this (terrestrial) world, the Dhishnya hearths the air, and the Âhavanîya the sky, and the air-world is not separated from this (earth-) world, why then, after building the Gârhapatya, does he build the Âhavanîya, and (only) then the Dhishnyas?' Well, at first these two worlds (heaven and earth) were together; and when they parted asunder, the space which was between (antar) them became that air (antariksha); for 'îksha ' indeed it was theretofore, and 'Now this "îksha" has come between (antarâ),' they said, whence 'antariksha' (air). And as to why, after building the Gârhapatya, he builds the Âhavanîya, it is because these two worlds were created first. Then, going back, he throws up the Dhishnya hearths, just to prevent discontinuity ofthe sacred work; and thus indeed the middle is completed, after the two ends have been completed.
2	1	1	They now take the Nirriti (bricks) from there. For, having built the Gârhapatya, the gods then ascended it,--the Gârhapatya being this (earth-) world, it is this world they ascended after completing it. They saw nothing but darkness not to be seen through.
2	1	2	They said, 'Think ye upon this, how we may dispel that darkness, evil!' They said, 'Meditate ye (ketay)!'--whereby indeed they said, 'Seek ye to build an altar (kitim)!'--'Seek ye so that we may dispel that darkness, evil!'
2	1	3	Whilst meditating, they saw those Nirriti bricks; they piled them up, and by them dispelled that darkness, evil; for Nirriti (corruption, or destruction) is evil; and inasmuch as by them they dispelled Nirriti, evil, these are Nirriti's (bricks).
2	1	4	Now that same thing which the gods did, is done here: even now that darkness, that evil, has indeed been dispelled by the gods themselves; but when he now does this, it is because he thinks, 'I must do what the gods did.' And, besides, he removes, by means of these (bricks), whatever evil, whatever corruption there is; and because he removes by them evil, corruption (nirriti), therefore these are Nirriti's (bricks).
2	1	5	And, again, why they take these (bricks) of Nirriti;--when the gods restored the relaxed Pragâpati, they cast him as seed into the fire-pan, thewomb; the fire-pan being indeed a womb. In the course of a year they prepared for him this foundation, even this (terrestrial) world; the Gârhapatya (hearth) being this world: therein they generated him. And whatever evil there was in him, whatever mucus, whatever inner and outer membrane, that they removed from him by means of these (bricks); and inasmuch as thereby they removed his evil, his corruption, these are Nirriti's (bricks).
2	1	6	In like manner the Sacrificer now casts his own self , as seed, into the fire-pan, the womb; the fire-pan being indeed a womb. In the course of a year he prepares for that (self of his) this foundation, even this (terrestrial) world; the Gârhapatya being this world: therein he generates it. And whatever evil there is of it, whatever mucus, whatever inner and outer membrane, that he removes therefrom by these (bricks); and inasmuch as he thereby removes its evil, its corruption, these are Nirriti's (bricks).
2	1	7	They measure a foot (square): he thus treads evil, corruption, under foot. They are unmarked; for whatever is not, that is unmarked (by characteristics): he thus makes evil, corruption to be non-existent. They get baked by (rice) husks, for husks belong to Nirriti: by Nirriti's own (objects) he thus performs Nirriti's rite. They are black, for black was that darkness; and black in truth is Nirriti (corruption).
2	1	8	With them they proceed towards that (southwestern) quarter, for that is Nirriti's quarter: he thus places Nirriti (corruption) in Nirriti's quarter. And anywhere where there is a self-produced hollow  or cleft in the ground, he lays down those (bricks); for on whatever part of this (earth) there is a cleaving, or in whatever part of it plants are not produced, verily that part of it Nirriti seizes upon: he thus places corruption in a (part) of the earth set aside for Nirriti. Having put them in their places in a direction away from himself , he lays them down .
2	1	9	'Seek thou him that offereth not Soma, nor other offering!' him who neither presses Soma nor makes offering Nirriti indeed visits;--'Of the thief do thou follow the way, of the robber!' that is, 'follow the way both of the thief and the robber, and even as a thief or a robber remains concealed, so do thou remain concealed!'--'Seek thou some one other than us: this is thy way;' that is, 'seek him who is ignorant of this (sacred work);'--'Homage be to thee, O divine Nirriti!' he thus turns Nirriti aside by rendering homage to her.
2	1	10	'Homage be unto thee full well, O sharp-edged Nirriti!' for Nirriti is indeed sharp-edged: to her he thereby renders homage;--'loose thouthis iron bond!' for it is indeed with an iron bond that Nirriti binds him whom she binds;--'being of one mind with Yama and Yamî,'--Yama doubtless is Agni, and Yam is this (earth), and by these two everything here is kept in check: thus, 'being of one mind with those two,'--'raise him unto the highest firmament!' the firmament is the heavenly world: thus, 'raise the Sacrificer up to the heavenly world!'
2	1	11	'Thee, O awful (goddess), into whose mouth I offer--' Nirriti is indeed awful, and into her mouth he now offers when he performs this divine rite;--'for the unloosing of these bonds;' that is, of those bonds with which he has been bound;--'Thee whom people rejoice in calling Earth,'--the Earth is this (world), and he who exists, exists thereon,--'but I know thee to be Nirriti everywhere!' that is, in every respect I know that thou art Nirriti. Now Nirriti is this earth, and this earth makes him decay who becomes corrupted: in speaking thus, it is as if he were to say, 'Thou art So and So, the son of So and So, I know thee, do not injure me!' for in no wise does he who is known injure one when spoken to.
2	1	12	He does not touch (the bricks),--Nirriti being evil,--lest he put himself in contact with evil. He does not 'settle' them,--settlement being a firm footing--lest he give a firm footing to evil. He does not pronounce the Sûdadohas verse upon them,--the Sûdadohas being the vital air,--lest he should join Nirriti (corruption) together, and restore her.
2	1	13	Now some lay (the bricks) down from the farther end towards themselves,--Nirriti (corruption) being evil,--lest they themselves should go the wayto corruption. Let him not do so, but let him lay them down in the direction away from him: he thus drives evil, corruption, away from him.
2	1	14	Three bricks he lays down,--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus repels evil, corruption.
2	1	15	The seat, the netting, the sling of the gold plate, and the two pads he throws down on the farther side (of the bricks),--the sling  is sacred to Nirriti: from Nirriti's sling he is thus freed.  'The indissoluble bond which the divine Nirriti hath fastened upon thy neck,'--indissoluble indeed for him who does not know this;--'that (bond) of thine I unloose, as from the middle of Âyus,'--Âyus  doubtless is Agni, and his middle (body) is that Gârhapatya which has been built;--not yet built is the Âhavanîya: hence whether a youth builds the altar, or an old man, he says 'as from the middle of Âyus;'--'now, being urged forward, eat thou this nourishment!' nourishment means food: thus, 'now, set free, eat thou this food.' With Trishtubh verses (he performs this rite), for the Trishtubh is a thunderbolt: it is thus with a thunderbolt that he repels evil, corruption.
2	1	16	There are three bricks, the seat, the netting, the sling of the gold plate, and the two pads; that makes eight;--the Gâyatrî consists of eight syllables,and Agni is Gâyatra: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus repels evil, corruption.
2	1	17	On the space between (the Sacrificer and the bricks) he pours out a jarful of water,--water is a thunderbolt: with a thunderbolt he thus separates from himself evil, corruption. With 'Homage to (the goddess of) Prosperity who hath done this!' they rise, for it was with a view to prosperity that the gods at first performed this rite, and to that (goddess) they then rendered homage; and for prosperity indeed this (Sacrificer) now performs this rite, and to that (goddess) he now renders homage. They go back (to the sacrificial ground) without looking back: they thus abandon evil, corruption, even without looking back to it.
2	1	18	Having returned, he stands worshipping by the fire; for when he goes into that (south-western) direction whilst Agni is only half built up, he does what is improper: he now makes amends to him to prevent his doing any harm.
2	1	19	And again, why he stands by (the fire). The Gârhapatya (hearth) is this (terrestrial) world; for the Gârhapatya is a foundation, and the foundation doubtless is this (earth). Now when he goes into that direction, he goes where there is no path; and when he stands by (the fire), he thereby returns to this (earth), the foundation, and establishes himself upon this foundation.
2	1	20	'The harbourer and gatherer of riches,' for a harbourer this world indeed is, a gatherer of riches;--'all form he watches over with his favours,'--that is, 'all forms (of being) he watches over withhis favours;'--'like the god Savitri, like Indra, he of true covenant stood at the meeting of ways ;' as the text, so its meaning.
2	2	1	He then prepares the Prâyanîya  (opening sacrifice). With the Havishkrit of that (oblation) he releases (the Sacrificer's) speech . Having released his speech, he throws away the grass-bush (stambayagus ). Having thrown away the grass-bush, and drawn the first line of enclosure , and the lines (across the mahâ-vedi), he says, 'Throw thrice!' and the Âgnîdhra throws thrice (the wooden sword) .
2	2	2	Having returned (to the offering, or hall-doorfire) he proceeds with the opening sacrifice. Having performed the opening sacrifice, he yokes a plough. For the gods at that time, being about to heal him (Agni-Pragâpati), first supplied him with food, and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now that he is about to heal him, first supply him with food. It (the food) is the plough (sîra), for 'sîra' is the same as 'sera :' he thus puts food into him.
2	2	3	It is made of udumbara (ficus glomerata) wood,--the Udumbara tree being sustenance, life-sap: he thus supplies him with sustenance, with life-sap. The cordage of the plough consists of muñga grass, triply twisted: the significance of this has been explained.
2	2	4	Standing behind the right (southern) hip of Agni (the site of the fire-altar) he (the Pratiprasthâtri) addresses it (the plough) while being yoked (by the Adhvaryu) in front of the left (northern) shoulder, with , 'The skilful yoke  the ploughs, and stretch across the yokes,'--the skilful are those who know, and they do yoke the plough and stretch the yokes across;--'the wise, with mind devoted to the gods,'--devotion means sacrifice: thus, 'the wise, performing sacrifice to the gods.'
2	2	5	'Yoke ye the ploughs, and stretch across the yokes!'--they indeed yoke the plough, and stretch the yokes across;--'into the ready womb here cast ye the seed!' it is for the seed that that womb, the furrow, is made; and if one casts (seed) into unploughed (ground), it is just as if one were to shed seed elsewhere than into the womb. 'And plentiful yield  be there through our song!'--the song is speech, and yield means food;--'and let the ripe crop go anigh the sickle!' for when food gets ripe, people approach it with the sickle. With two (verses) he yokes, a Gâyatrî and a Trishtubh one: the significance of this has been explained.
2	2	6	He yokes the right (ox) first, then the left one: thus it is (done) with the gods, differently in human (practice). It is a team of six oxen, or one of twelve oxen, or one of twenty-four oxen: it is the year (he obtains) as the consummation.
2	2	7	He then ploughs through it,--ploughing means food; and the gods at that time when they were about to heal him (Agni-Pragâpati) first put food into him; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now when he is about to heal him, first put food into him.
2	2	8	Only the body (of the altar-site) he ploughs through, not the wings and tail: he thus puts food into the body. And, indeed, the food which is put into the body benefits the body as well as the wings and tail; but that which (is put) into the wings and tail does not benefit either the body or the wings and tail.
2	2	9	On the right (south) side of the fire-altar, he ploughs first a furrow eastwards  inside the enclosing-stones, with , 'Right luckily may the plough-shares plough up the ground, luckily the tillers ply with theiroxen!'--'luckily--luckily,' he says, 'for what is successful that is lucky:' he thus makes it (the furrow) successful.
2	2	10	Then on the hindpart (he ploughs a furrow) northwards , with , 'With sweet ghee let the furrow be saturated,'--as the text so its meaning;--'approved of by the All-gods, by the Maruts!' for both the All-gods and the Maruts have power over the rain;--'sapful, and teeming with milk,'--milk means life-sap: thus, 'teeming with life-sap and food;'--'with milk, O furrow, turn thou unto us!' that is, 'with life-sap, O furrow, turn thou unto us!'
2	2	11	Then on the left (north) side (he ploughs a furrow) eastwards , with , 'The share-shod  plough,'--that is, 'the plough abounding in wealth,'--'propitious, offering prospect for the Soma-cup '--for Soma is food;--'it throweth up the cow, the sheep, the lusty wife, the swift-wheeledwaggon,' for all this the furrow throws up (yields).
2	2	12	Then on the forepart he ploughs a furrow) southwards , with , 'Milk out, O cow of plenty, their desire to Mitra, and to Varuna, to Indra, to the Asvins, to Pûshan, to creatures and plants!' husbandry is (beneficial) to all deities: thus, 'Milk out for these deities all their desires!'--He first ploughs thus (south-west to southeast), then thus (south-west to north-west), then thus (north-west to north-east), then thus (north-east to south-east): that is (sunwise), for thus it is with the gods .
2	2	13	Four furrows he ploughs with prayer: he thereby puts into him (Pragâpati-Agni) what food there is in the four quarters; and that with prayer,--true is the prayer, and true (manifest) are those quarters.
2	2	14	He then ploughs (again) through the body: he thereby puts into him what food there is in the year. Silently (he does so), for what is silent is undetermined, and the undetermined is everything: by means of everything he thus puts food into him. He first ploughs thus (through the middle from south to north), then thus (south-west to north-east), then thus (east to west), then thus (north-west to south-east),--that is sunwise , for thus it is with the gods.
2	2	15	Three furrows he ploughs each time,--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus puts food into him.
2	2	16	Twelve furrows he ploughs silently,--the year (consists of) twelve months, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus puts food into him.
2	2	17	Both kinds (of furrows) amount to sixteen,--of sixteen parts Pragâpati consists, and Pragâpati is Agni: he thus puts into him food proportionate to his body. And, indeed, the food which is proportionate to the body, satisfies, and does no harm; but that which is too much, does harm, and that which is too little, does not satisfy.
2	2	18	And, again, why he ploughs through him,--the gods being about to put him (Pragâpati) together, thereby in the first place put the vital airs into him; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), being about to put him together, thereby in the first place put the vital airs into him. They (the furrows) are lines, for these vital airs (move) in lines (channels).
2	2	19	Four furrows he ploughs with prayer: he thereby puts into him those four well-defined vital airs which are in the head; and this (he does) with prayer,--true is the prayer, and true (manifest, real) are these vital airs in the head.
2	2	20	And as to why he ploughs through the body: he thereby puts into him those vital airs which are inside the body. Silently (he does so), for who knows how many vital airs there are inside the body?
2	2	21	Having gained the object for which he yokes those (oxen), he now unyokes them, with , 'Be ye unyoked, ye inviolable (oxen)!' for inviolable  they indeed are with the gods;--'Ye god ward-striding!' for with them he performs the divine work;--'We have come to the end of this gloom;'--gloom doubtless means famine: thus, 'we have come to the end of this famine;'--'we have attained the light!' for he who attains the gods, the sacrifice, indeed attains the light. He then lets them loose towards north-east--the significance of this has been explained . He gives them to the Adhvaryu, for it is he that does the work with them: let him assign them (to him) at the time of (the presentation of) the Dakshinâs.
2	3	1	He then places a bunch of darbha (kusa) grass (poa cynosuroides) on (the middle of the altar-site); for the gods then placed plants thereon, and in like manner does the Sacrificer now place plants thereon.
2	3	2	And, again, why he places a bunch of grass thereon;--when he (Agni) is built up, he is born, and he is born here for all (kinds of) food; but these darbha plants (contain) both kinds of food, for they are both water and plants. Now the waters which, loathing Vritra, rose up on the dry land forming bushes, became those grasses ,--inasmuch as they rose forming bushes (dribh), they are (called) darbha-grasses. These darbha-grasses, then, are the water (which remained) pure, and meet for sacrifice, when Vritra flowed towards it; and inasmuch as they are darbha-grasses, they are plants: by both kinds of food he thus gratifies him (Agni).
2	3	3	at the meeting of the furrows, for the meeting of furrows is speech (the mouth) , and the furrows (channels) are the vital airs; and this is their place of meeting; and in the mouth food is put for the vital airs. In the middle (he places the bunch), whereby he puts it into the verymiddle of him; silently (he does so), for what is silent is undefined, and the undefined is everything: with everything he thus puts food into him.
2	3	4	He then offers thereon,--when he (Agni) is built, he is born, and he is born here for all (kinds of) food; but that ghee is the life-sap (essence) of this universe, for it is the life-sap of both the waters and plants: he thus gratifies him by the life-sap of this universe. And as far as the life-sap extends, so far extends the body: he thus gratifies him by this universe. With (ghee) taken in five (ladlings, he offers),--the fire-altar consists of five layers, five seasons are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much food he thus gratifies him.
2	3	5	And, again, why he offers thereon;--when in the beginning the Rishis, the vital airs , put together this Agni, they gained for themselves that fore-share  in him: hence they are the fore-sharers. Thus when he offers on (the grass-bush) he thereby gratifies those Rishis, the vital airs, who gained for themselves the fore-share in him (Agni). With fivefold-taken ghee (he offers): the significance of this has been explained.
2	3	6	And, again, why he offers thereon;--whatever forms, whatever modes of chanting, whatever prishtha (stotras), whatever metres he is now going to bestow on Agni, for them he prepares this fore-share, and it is them he thereby gratifies. Withfivefold-taken ghee (he offers): the significance of this has been explained.
2	3	7	And, again, why he offers thereon;--at that time the gods were afraid, thinking, 'Long indeed is this performance: we hope the Rakshas, the fiends, will not smite here this (Agni) of ours!' They saw this preliminary conclusion  of this performance, and brought that whole (Agni) to completion even at that (point), and built him up then; and in like manner this (Sacrificer) brings that whole (Agni) to completion even at this (point), and builds him now.
2	3	8	'The year,' this is a layer (of bricks);--'together with the dark half-months,' this is a layer of earth;--'the Dawn,' this is a layer (of bricks);--'together with the ruddy (cows),' this is a layer of earth;--'the two Asvins,' this is a layer (of bricks); 'together with their wonderful deeds,' this is a layer of earth;--'the Sun,' this is a layer (of bricks);--'together with the dappled horse,' this is a layer of earth;--'(Agni) Vaisvânara,' this is a layer (of bricks);--'together with Idâ,' this is a layer of earth;--'with ghee,' this is a layer (of bricks);--'Svâ-,' this is a layer of earth;--'hâ!' this is a layer (of bricks).
2	3	9	There are thirteen utterings,--thirteen months are a year; thirteen in number are the layers of bricks and earth of the fire-altar: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great he thus builds him up. With butter he sacrifices,--butter is thesame as Agni: it is Agni he thus builds up. With fivefold-taken (butter he offers),--the altar consists of five layers,--five seasons are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great he thus builds him up. He offers raising (the spoon) upwards: he thus builds Agni upwards by means of the layers (of the altar).
2	4	1	He then pours out jarfuls of water,--for the gods then said, 'Meditate ye (ketay)!' whereby they doubtless meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer (kitim)!' Whilst meditating they saw the rain to be a (suitable) layer, and put it on that (altar-site); and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now put it thereon.
2	4	2	Jarfuls of water are (poured out); for rain is water: it is rain he thereby bestows on it. With an udumbara jar (he pours them on): the significance of this has been told;--with a four-cornered one;--four quarters there are: from all quarters he thus bestows rain thereon.
2	4	3	Three jarfuls he pours out each time ,--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus bestows rain thereon.
2	4	4	Twelve jarfuls of water he pours on the ploughed ground,--twelve months are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus bestows rain thereon.
2	4	5	On the ploughed ground he pours (water), whence it rains for (the benefit of) the ploughed land. Now were he only to pour it on the ploughed ground, and not on the unploughed, it would only rain for the ploughed land, not for the unploughed. And were he only to pour it on the unploughed ground, and not on the ploughed, it would only rain for the unploughed land, and not for the ploughed. He pours it both on the ploughed, and the unploughed, ground; whence it rains both for the ploughed, and the unploughed, ground.
2	4	6	Three (jarfuls)  he pours both on the ploughed, and on the unploughed, ground;--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus bestows rain thereon.
2	4	7	And, again, why he pours out jarfuls of water;--at that time the gods, being about to put him (Agni-Pragâpati) together, in the first place put water into him; and in like manner does this one now, being about to put him together, in the first place put water into him.
2	4	8	Three jarfuls he pours out each time,--threefold is Agni: as large as Agni is, as large as is his measure, by so much he thus puts water into him.
2	4	9	Twelve jarfuls he pours on the ploughed ground,--twelve months are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus puts water into him.
2	4	10	On the ploughed ground he pours it: he thereby puts water into the vital airs. But were he to pour (water) only on the ploughed ground, andnot on the unploughed, there would be water only in (the channels of) the vital airs, and not in the other (parts of the) body. And were he to pour (water) only on the unploughed ground, and not on the ploughed, there would be water only in (the other parts of) the body, and not in the vital airs. He pours it both on the ploughed, and the unploughed, ground, whence there is water here both in (the channels of) the vital airs and in the body.
2	4	11	Three (jarfuls) he pours both on the ploughed, and on the unploughed, ground;--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus puts water into him.
2	4	12	Fifteen jarfuls of water he pours out,--fifteenfold is the thunderbolt: by that fifteenfold thunderbolt of his he thus drives away all evil.
2	4	13	He then sows all (kinds of) herb (-seed);--for the gods then said, 'Meditate ye!' whereby doubtless they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer!' whilst meditating, they saw food to be a (suitable) layer, and put that on (or, into) him (Agni); and in like manner does this one now put it into him.
2	4	14	It is (seed) of all herbs,--all herbs means all food; he thus puts all (kinds of) food into him. Let him omit one of those kinds of food, and not eat thereof as long as he lives. By means of the udumbara jar (he sows the seed): the significance of this has been explained;--with a four-cornered one,--there are four quarters: from all quarters he thus puts food into him (Agni). He sows it with anushtubh (verses),--the Anushtubh (metre) is speech, and by means of speech (the mouth ) food is eaten.
2	4	15	With three verses he sows each time ,--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus puts food into him.
2	4	16	With twelve verses he sows on the ploughed ground,--twelve months are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus puts food into him.
2	4	17	On the ploughed ground he sows, whence food ripens on ploughed ground. Were he to sow only on the ploughed ground, and not on the unploughed, food would only ripen on ploughed ground, not on unploughed; and were he to sow only on unploughed ground, and not on ploughed ground, food would only ripen on unploughed ground, and not on ploughed ground. He sows on both the ploughed, and the unploughed, ground: hence food ripens both on ploughed, and on unploughed, ground.
2	4	18	With three (verses) he sows both on the ploughed, and on the unploughed, ground,--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus puts food into him.
2	4	19	And, again, why he sows all (kinds of) herb (-seed),--the gods at that time, being about to put him (Agni-Pragâpati) together, in the first place healed him by healing medicine; and in like manner does this one now, being about to put him together, first heal him with healing medicine.
2	4	20	It is (seed) of all herbs;--all herbs is thesame as all (kinds of) medicine: by all (kinds of) healing medicine he thus heals him.
2	4	21	With three verses he sows each time,--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus heals him.
2	4	22	With twelve verses he sows on the ploughed ground,--twelve months are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus heals him.
2	4	23	On the ploughed ground he sows: he thereby heals the vital airs. And were he to sow only on the ploughed ground, and not on the unploughed, he would only heal the vital airs, and not the other (parts of the) body; and were he to sow only on the unploughed, and not on the ploughed, ground, he would only heal the body, and not the vital airs: he sows both on the ploughed, and on the unploughed, ground; and thus he heals both the vital airs and the body.
2	4	24	With three (verses) he sows both on the ploughed, and on the unploughed, ground,--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus heals him.
2	4	25	Fifteen jarfuls of water he pours out, and with fifteen verses he sows,--that makes thirty,--the Virâg (metre) consists of thirty syllables, and the Virâg (the far-shining, or far-ruling) is the whole food: the whole food he thus puts into him.
2	4	26	'The herbs first grown three ages before the gods ,'--the gods doubtless are the seasons,and from them those (herbs) used to grow thrice, in spring, in the rainy season, and in the autumn;--'of the brown ones will I ponder,'--the brown one, doubtless, is Soma, and the herbs are related to Soma, and the Purusha (Pragâpati) is related to herbs ;--'the hundred powers,'--inasmuch as he here lives a hundred (years), and has a hundred merits, and a hundred energies, there are in him those hundred powers;--'and seven,'--he thereby speaks of those seven vital airs in the head.
2	4	27	'Yours, O Mother, are a hundred powers, and yours a thousand growths,'--inasmuch as (the plants) here are shooting out a hundredfold, and a thousandfold;--'Ye of a hundred virtues, render ye free from sickness this one of mine!' that is, him whom I am now healing.
2	4	28	These (verses)  have one and the same explanationwith regard to this (Agni-Pragâpati),how he may heal him, and preserve him. They are anushtubh verses,--the Anushtubh is speech, and speech is all healing medicine: by means of all healing medicine he thus heals him.
2	4	29	Now, then, regarding the defined and the undefined (ceremonies);--with prayer he yokes two oxen, silently the others; with prayer he ploughs four furrows, silently the others; silently he puts on the grass-bush, with prayer he makes a libation thereon; silently he pours out the jarfuls of water, with prayer he sows.
2	4	30	This Agni is Pragâpati, and Pragâpati is both the defined and the undefined, the limited and theunlimited. Now whatever he does with prayer thereby he restores that form of his which is defined, limited; and whatever he does silently, thereby he restores that form of his which is undefined, unlimited,--verily, whosoever, knowing this, performs thus, restores this whole and complete Pragâpati. The outer forms are defined, and the inner ones are undefined; and Agni is the same as an animal: hence the outer forms of the animal are defined, and the inner ones undefined.
3	1	1	Built is the Gârhapatya, unbuilt the Âhavanîya; he then buys the king (Soma): the Gârhapatya being this (terrestrial) world, the Âhavanîya the sky, and Soma he that blows yonder, he thus places him (Vâyu, the wind) between these two worlds; and hence he blows between these two worlds.
3	1	2	And as to why he buys the king when the Gârhapatya is built, and the Âhavanîya unbuilt,--Agni is the body, and Soma the vital air: he thus places the vital air in the middle of the body, and hence that vital air is in the middle of the body.
3	1	3	And, again, why he buys the king when the Gârhapatya is built, and the Âhavanîya unbuilt,--Agni is the body, and Soma is the life-sap: he thus supplies the body with life-sap, and hence this body (of ours) is supplied with life-sap from end to end.
3	1	4	Having bought the king, and driven him about, he then takes out the material for the guest-meal. With the Havishkrit of that (ceremony) he releases speech. And in this way  he interlinks the performanceof the (Soma) sacrifice and the performance of the fire (altar) for the purpose of unity of performance, thinking, 'Uniform shall be this performance!'
3	1	5	And, again, why he interlinks them,--Agni (the fire-altar) is the body, and the (Soma) sacrifice is the vital air: he thus places the vital air in the midst of the body, and hence that vital air is in the middle of the body.
3	1	6	And, again, why he interlinks them,--Agni is the body, and the (Soma) sacrifice is the vital sap: he thus supplies the body with vital sap, and hence this body is supplied with vital sap from end to end. He then returns to the site of the Âhavanîya.
3	1	7	Now some sweep with the palâsa branch on both occasions , saying, 'Surely, on both occasions he builds (an altar).' Let him, however, not do so; for by (building) the Gârhapatya he settles, and by the Âhavanîya he rises upwards: therefore let him not do so.
3	1	8	And only on the Gârhapatya (site) he throws saline soil, not on the Âhavanîya; for the Gârhapatya is this (terrestrial) world, and saline soil means cattle: he thus bestows cattle on this world, whence there are cattle in this world.
3	1	9	And only on the Âhavanîya (site) he places a lotus leaf, not on the Gârhapatya; for the lotus leaf means water, and the Âhavanîya the sky: he thus places the waters (vapours) in the sky. On both hescatters sand; for sand means seed, and in both (fire-altars) fashioning (of Agni) takes place: 'May he be fashioned from out of that seed!' thus he thinks.
3	1	10	He scatters it with two different formulas; for the Gârhapatya is the world of men, and the Âhavanîya is the world of the gods, and different indeed are the divine and the human. With the longer formula he scatters it on the Âhavanîya, and with the shorter one on the Gârhapatya, for longer is the life of the gods, and shorter the life of men. On the Gârhapatya he scatters the sand before (the setting up of) the enclosing-stones; for sand is seed: 'May these be fashioned from out of that seed!' thus he thinks.
3	1	11	As to this they say, 'If the enclosing-stones are the womb, and the sand is seed, and the sand is strown on the Gârhapatya before (the setting up of) the enclosing-stones, how, then, is that seed of his not shed aside, (but) is received (by the womb)?' Well, the saline soil is the amnion, and inasmuch as he strews first the saline soil, that seed of his is not shed aside, but is received by that amnion. He now addresses the enclosing-stones on the Âhavanîya: the meaning of this has been explained . He then scatters sand: sand being seed, that seed of his is not shed aside, but is received also by that womb.
3	1	12	And only on the Âhavanîya he strokes it (even) with two (verses) containing (the verb) 'to grow ,' not on the Gârhapatya; for the Gârhapatya is this (terrestrial) world, and the Âhavanîya is the heavenly world; and this Sacrificer, being indeedborn in this world, is really intended to be born in the heavenly world: when he strokes (the sand) even on the Âhavanîya with two (verses) containing (the verb) 'to grow,' and not on the Gârhapatya, he causes him to be born in the heavenly world.
3	1	13	He now puts clod-bricks thereon ,--that fire-altar is these worlds, and the clod-bricks are the regions: he thus places the regions into these worlds; whence there are those regions in these worlds.
3	1	14	He takes them from outside the (site of the) fire-altar; for those regions which are in these worlds are already possessed by him (Agni); and he now bestows on him those regions which are beyond these worlds.
3	1	15	From outside the Vedi (he takes them);--the Vedi being this (earth), and those regions which are on this (earth) being already possessed by him, he now bestows on him those regions which are beyond this (earth).
3	1	16	And, again, why he puts clod-bricks thereon,--when Pragâpati was disjointed, his vital sap flowed over all the regions (or, in all directions); and when the gods restored him  they, by means of these clod-bricks, put into him that vital sap; and in like manner does this one now put that vital sap into him.
3	1	17	He takes them from outside (the site of) the fire-altar; for the vital sap which is in these worlds is already possessed by him (Agni), and he now putsinto him that vital sap which flowed away beyond these worlds .
3	1	18	From outside the Vedi (he takes them),--the Vedi being this (earth), and that vital sap which is in this (terrestrial) world being already possessed by him, he now puts into him the vital sap which flowed beyond this (earth).
3	1	19	He takes them with the sacrificial (wooden) sword,--the sword is a thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt means force, and this (earth) means wealth: by force he thus obtains wealth.
3	1	20	From the front side he brings one, with , 'May he not injure me who is the begetter of the Earth!'--the begetter of the Earth doubtless is Pragâpati (the lord of creatures and generation): thus, 'May Pragâpati not injure me!'--'Or he of true ordinances who hath pervaded the sky,' that is, 'Or he of true ordinances who has created the sky;'--'Or he who first begat the shining waters,'--the shining waters doubtless are the men: thus, 'he who first created men;'--'To the god Ka (who?) let us do homage by offering!' Ka doubtless is Pragâpati, thus, 'To him let us do homage by offering!' Having brought it he puts it on the body (of the altar-site) inside the enclosing-stones: he thereby puts into him (Agni) what vital sap had flowed away from him in the eastern direction, and also the eastern region itself he bestows upon him.
3	1	21	Then (he fetches a clod) from the south, with , 'Turn hither, O Earth, withsacrifice, with milk!' as the text, so the meaning;--'Agni, sent forth, hath mounted thy skin;' whatsoever is on this (earth) that is her skin; and that (skin) Agni mounts, when sent forth, when blazing forth. Having brought it he puts it on the body (of the altar) inside the junction of the (right) wing (and the body): he thereby puts into him (Agni) what vital sap had flowed from him in the southern direction, and also the southern region itself he bestows upon him.
3	1	22	Then from behind , 'O Agni, what in thee is pure, what brilliant, what clean, what meet for sacrifice,'--Agni doubtless is this (earth): of her he says this;--'that do we bring to the gods,' that is, 'that we bring for this divine work.' Having brought it he puts it on the body (of the altar) inside the junction of the tail (and the body): he thereby puts into him what vital sap had flowed away from him in the western direction, and also the western region itself he bestows upon him. Let him not take it exactly from the back (west) lest he should take the vital sap from the path of the sacrifice: he takes it from about there .
3	1	23	Then from the north, with , 'Sap and strength have I taken from here ,'--that is, 'Sap and strength I take from here;'--'the womb of sacred law,' the sacred law doubtless is the truth: thus, 'the womb of the truth;'--'the stream of the mighty,' the mighty (buffalo, ormahisha) doubtless is Agni, for he, being born here great (mahat), animated everything;--'May it accrue to me in the cows, in the bodies,'--the body is the self: thus, 'May it accrue to me both in the cows and in (my own) self;'--'I leave behind decline, weakness, sickness!' therewith he spreads the sand (by stroking): he thereby consigns to that (northern) region whatever decline, weakness, and sickness there is; whence hungry people (live) in that region. Having brought that (clod), he puts it on the body (of the altar) on the middle of the junction of the (left) wing (and the body): he thereby puts into him (Agni) what vital sap flowed away in the northerly direction; and also the northern region itself he bestows upon him.
3	1	24	These same (clods) are the regions; he places them on all sides: he thus places the regions on all sides; whence the regions are on every side.  as to face each other from every side: he thereby places the regions to face each other from every side, and hence the regions face each other from every side. He places them separately, 'settles ' them separately, and separately pronounces the Sûdadohas upon them; for separate from each other are the regions. Standing he places them, for the regions, as it were, stand; and stronger, indeed, one is whilst standing.
3	1	25	These same (clods) are bricks having special prayers (yagushmatî ): on the body (of the altar) he places them, not on the wings and tail; for bricks having special prayers are placed on the body, not on the wings or tail.
3	1	26	As to this they say, 'How do these (clod-bricks) come to be put on as baked, as heated (burnt) ones?' Well, these (clods) are vital sap, and the vital sap (blood) is naturally-heated; and, moreover, whatever comes in contact with Agni Vaisvânara, even thereby comes to be put on as baked, as heated.
3	1	27	He then throws up the Uttara-vedi  (high-altar),--the Vedi is this (earth), the Uttara-vedi the sky, and the clod-bricks are the regions: thus when he puts on the clod-bricks between (the preparation of) the Vedi and (that of) the Uttara-vedi, he thereby places the regions between these two worlds; whence the regions are between these two worlds. He makes it either a yoke long on each side, or forty feet,--whichever way he pleases. He then throws sand thereon: the meaning of this has been explained.
3	1	28	He throws it on the Uttara-vedi;--the Uttaravedi is the womb: he thus infuses seed into the womb; and the seed which is infused into the womb becomes generative. He covers the whole body (of the altar) with that (sand): he thus puts seed into the whole body ; whence the seed is produced from the whole body.
3	1	29	'Thine, O Agni, is glory and vigour,'--his glory (sravas) and vigour doubtless is the smoke, for that announces (srâvaya) him in yonder world,--'mighty shine forth theflames, O rich-beamed one!' that is, 'the flames of (thee), the mighty one, shine forth, O thou, abounding in wealth!'--'With might, O wide-rayed one (thou bestowest) strength, worthy of song,' might is power: thus, 'By (thy) power, O wide-rayed one, (thou givest) food worthy of song;'--'bestowest thou upon the worship, O sage!' worship doubtless is the Sacrificer: thus, 'Upon the worship thou bestowest, O sage!'
3	1	30	'Pure-flamed, bright-flamed,' for pure-flamed and bright-flamed he (Agni) is; 'full-flamed, didst thou burst forth with light,' that is, 'full-flamed shonest thou forth with light;'--'running about as their son thou helpest the two mothers,' for as their son he does help the two mothers;--'thou fillest both spheres,' the two spheres doubtless are these two, heaven and earth, and these two he indeed fills,--with smoke yonder (sky), with rain this (earth).
3	1	31	'Child of strength, knower of beings, in benedictions,' that is, 'child of strength, knower of beings, in praises,'--'delight thou, kindly in thoughts,' that is, 'shine thou, kindly in thoughts;'--'in thee have they brought together multiform nourishments,' that is, 'in thee have they brought together many-formed nourishments;'--'of wondrous help are the fair-born,' as the text, so the meaning.
3	1	32	'Ruling, O Agni, spread thou by beings'--the beings are men: thus, 'Shining, O Agni, spread thyself by men!'--'riches amongst us, O immortal!' that is, 'bestowing wealth upon us, O immortal!'--'Of beautiful form, shinest thou'--for he indeed shines, of beautiful form;--'thoufillest (us with) profitable  wisdom;' that is, thou fillest (us with) perennial wisdom.'
3	1	33	'Him, the wise arranger of the cult,'--the cult is the sacrifice: thus, 'him, the wise preparer of the sacrifice;'--'ruling over great wealth,' that is, 'ruling in great wealth;'--'the bestowal of good things,--prosperous, mighty (mah) nourishment,'--that is, 'the bestowal of good things; prosperous, ample (mahat) nourishment,'--'givest thou, and profitable substance,' that is, 'givest thou, and perennial substance.'
3	1	34	' the righteous,' that is, the truthful;'--'the mighty,' the mighty (or buffalo) doubtless is Agni;--'the all-remarkable,' for he (Agni) is indeed remarkable to all;--'(thee), Agni, men have placed foremost for happiness,' happiness doubtless is the sacrifice, and for the sacrifice they indeed place him foremost;--'thee, the hearer, the far-ruling, divine one, with song the human tribes;' that is, 'thee who hearest, thee, the far-ruling god, we men invoke.'
3	1	35	Now this hymn of six verses is that same Agni Vaisvânara; and it is in order to make a beginning (in the building of the altar) that that sand is scattered,--he thereby pours into it Agni Vaisvânara as seed;--(he does so) with a six-versed hymn: six seasons are a year and the year is Vaisvânara (belonging to all men).
3	1	36	As to this they say, 'If the seed is said to be seed what is its seed characteristic?'--Let him say, 'white;' for seed is white;--or 'speckled,' for seed is, as it were, speckled.
3	1	37	As to this they say, 'As seed is moist, and he scatters dry sand, how does it become moist for him, after the manner of seed?' Well, the metres are vital sap, and vital sap is moist; and inasmuch as he scatters that (sand) with metres, it is thus that it becomes moist for him, after the manner of seed.
3	1	38	As to this they say, 'How does it come to be put on for him by means of the day and the night?' Well, day and night are two, and there are two (kinds of) seed, the white and the black: as black and white it is thus put on for him by means of the day and the night.
3	1	39	As to this they say, 'How does that (sand), put on by the days and nights, become complete (or perfect) for him, neither deficient, nor superabundant?' Well, endless are the days and nights, and endless is the sand: it is thus that, put on by the days and nights, it becomes complete for him, neither deficient, nor superabundant. 'And wherefrom (is obtained) the oceanic (Samudriya ) metre?' The ocean is endless, and the sand is endless: that is the oceanic metre.
3	1	40	As to this they say, 'How is that (sand) of his put on separately with different prayers?' Well, prayer is thought; this thought, prayer, comes to be equal to the whole sand : and thus that (sand) of his comes to be put on separately with different prayers.
3	1	41	As to this they say, 'How does that (sand) of his come to be put on by all the metres?'--Inasmuch as he scatters it with that hymn of six verses; for as many syllables as there are in theseven metres, so many syllables there are in that hymn of six verses : thus that (sand) of his comes to be put on by all the metres.
3	1	42	And as to why he scatters sand,--that Agni (fire-altar) is Pragâpati, and Pragâpati is the whole Brahman. Now that sand is (put) in (the place of) the lost part of the Brahman; and that part of it which has not been lost is this fire-altar which is now being built: thus when he scatters sand he restores to him that lost part of the Brahman. That (sand which) he scatters is unnumbered, unlimited; for who knows how great is that lost part of the Brahman? And verily he who, knowing this, scatters sand, restores the whole, complete Pragâpati.
3	1	43	As to this they say, 'What is the number of these unnumbered sand grains?' Let him say, 'Two;' for there are two kinds of sand, the white and the black; or let him say, 'Seven hundred and twenty,' for so many days and nights there are in the year; or 'Two hundred and fifty-two,' for so many syllables there are in that hymn of six verses; or 'Twenty-five,' for seed is twenty-fivefold .
3	1	44	This same (sand represents) bricks with special prayers: he places it on the body (of the altar), noton the wings and tail; for bricks with special prayers are placed on the body, not on the wings and tail. He does not 'settle' it, lest he should stop the seed, and generation.
3	1	45	He then strokes it (the sand) even by means of two verses containing the verb 'to grow:' he thereby causes that infused seed to grow, whence the seed infused into the womb grows;--with two (verses) relating to Soma (he strokes the sand); for Soma is breath: he thus puts breath into the seed; whence the infused seed becomes possessed of breath. But, indeed, were it to come forth without breath it would become putrid; and this indeed is the Sûdadohas  in this case; for Soma is breath, and the Sûdadohas is breath.
3	1	46	'Grow thou! let manly power gather in thee from all sides, O Soma!' manly power doubtless is seed: thus, 'Grow thou! let seed gather in thee from every side, O Soma!'--'Be thou in the gathering of strength!' in food doubtless is strength: thus, 'be thou in the gathering of food!'--'Let the drinks, let the forces gather in thee!'--drink doubtless means vital sap, and in food are forces: thus, let vital sap, let food gather itself in thee!'--'and manly powers in thee, the overcomer of enemies;' that is, 'and seed in thee, the overcomer of evil;'--'growing, O Soma, for the sake of immortality,' he thereby lays immortality into the generative power, whence generative power is immortal;--'gain thou the highest glory in the heavens!' his highest gloryin the heavens doubtless is the moon, for that one causes him to be celebrated in yonder world . With two (verses) he makes him grow, a gâyatrî and a trishtubh one,--the significance of this has been explained.
3	1	47	Now then the (mystic) correspondence,--four clod-bricks he puts on; with a six-versed (hymn) he scatters (the sand); with two (verses) he makes (the seed) grow; that makes twelve,--twelve months are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.
3	2	1	Having smoothed (the sand) down with the two verses containing (the verb) 'to grow,' and returned (to the hall) he proceeds with the guest offering. Having performed the guest offering, he proceeds with the Pravargya and the Upasad . Having performed the Pravargya and the Upasad, they appease that (first) layer on the (red ox-)skin. And as to why on a skin: for the obtainment of the forms, the skin being outward form;--on the hairy side: for the obtainment of the forms, hair being outward form;--on a ruddy (skin): for the obtainment of all forms, all forms (colours being contained) in the ruddy;--on (the skin) of an ox: for the obtainment of Agni's forms, the ox being the same as Agni;--on (the skin spread) with the neck towards the east, for that (tends) godward.
3	2	2	He spreads it in front of the Gârhapatya, on the Vedi, with the hairy side upwards, and the neck towards the east: thereon they appease that layer. Now he sprinkles (the bricks);--when he sprinkles, he thereby makes it pure, sacrificially clean;--with clarified butter (he sprinkles), for that is pure, sacrificially clean; and also with the view of its being unsurpassed , for no other sacrificial food is sprinkled with ghee;--silently (he sprinkles), for what is (done) silently is undefined, and the undefined is everything: by means of everything he thus makes it pure, and sacrificially clean; and also with the view of its being unsurpassed, for no other sacrificial food is sprinkled silently.
3	2	3	And, again, why he sprinkles,--this (layer of bricks) is sacrificial food, and as such he bastes it ; for whatever sacrificial food is buttered, and basted, that is palatable and sacrificially clean. With ghee (he bastes it), for sacrificial food is basted with ghee; silently (he does so), for silently sacrificial food is basted;--by means of stalks of Kusa grass, for these are pure, and sacrificially clean;--by means of the tops, for the top is sacred to the gods.
3	2	4	As to this they say, 'When he sprinkles only the first layer, how does that whole fire-altar of his come to be sprinkled, how does it come to be led forward on the skin, and how led forward by the horse ?' Inasmuch as in this (layer) he (symbolically)  sprinkles the bricks of all the layers; andthus indeed that whole fire-altar of his comes to be sprinkled, and led forward on the skin, and led forward by the horse. They lift up this (first) layer .
3	2	5	He (the Adhvaryu) then says (to the Hotri), 'Recite to the fires being led forward!' For at that time when the gods were setting out to spread the sacrifice, the Rakshas, the fiends, sought to smite them, saying, 'Ye shall not sacrifice! ye shall not spread the sacrifice!!' Having made those fires, those bricks, to be sharp-edged thunderbolts, they hurled these at them, and laid them low thereby; and having laid them low, they spread that sacrifice in a place free from danger and devilry.
3	2	6	Now, what the gods did is done here,--even now those Rakshas are indeed smitten by the gods themselves; and when he nevertheless does this, it is because he thinks, 'I must do what the gods did.' And so, having made those fires, those bricks, to be sharp-edged thunderbolts, he hurls them at whatever Rakshas, whatever evildoers there may be, and lays them low thereby; and having laid them low, he spreads the sacrifice in a place free from danger and devilry.
3	2	7	And as to why (he recites) to the fires,--it is because there are here many fires, to wit, those layers; and as to (his reciting) to them being led forward (pra-har), it is because he hurls (pra-har) them forward (as thunderbolts).
3	2	8	Now some recite , 'The Agnis Purîshyas, together with those of the streams,'--a form of starting . Let him not do so; let him recite gâyatrî verses addressed to Agni, and relating to (objects of) desire: , 'Hither may Vatsa lead thy mind even from the highest seat, O Agni, with the song desirous of thee!'--, 'To thee, O Agni, best of Aṅgiras, all good homesteads have laid themselves out for (the obtainment of) their desire.'--, 'Agni, the one all-ruler, shineth in the beloved homes, the (object of) desire of all that is and shall be.'
3	2	9	Verses addressed to Agni he recites for the obtainment of Agni's forms;--and such as relate to desire, for the obtainment of his desires;--Gâyatrî ones,--Agni is Gâyatra: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus pours him forth as seed;--with three (verses),--Agni is threefold: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus pours him forth as seed. These (three), with the (first and last verses) recited thrice, amount to seven,--of seven layers consists the fire-altar , seven seasons are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become. He recites in a low voice, for here in the sacrifice seed is (cast), and seed is cast silently. He (the Hotri) marches reciting behind (the bricks carried by the attendants); he thus marches, defending the sacrifice by the metres from behind.
3	2	10	And in front they lead a white horse. For at that time the gods were afraid lest the Rakshas, the fiends, should smite them here. They saw that thunderbolt, even yonder sun; for that horse is yonder sun: having driven off the Rakshas, the fiends, in front, by that thunderbolt, they obtained well-being in a place free from danger and devilry. They arrive at the (site of) the fire-altar; south of the tail (of the altar) they set down the layer (of bricks); from the north they make the horse step (on the site of the altar).
3	2	11	They lead it eastward on the left (north) side of the altar, inside the enclosing-stones, whereby they ward off evil from the eastern region; then southward, whereby they ward off evil from the south; then westward, whereby they ward off evil from the western region; then northward, whereby they ward off evil from the northern region. Having thus warded off the Rakshas, the fiends, from all the regions, he sets it (the horse) free towards northeast: the significance of this has been explained.
3	2	12	Whilst it goes westward he makes it smell (kiss) that layer (of bricks);--that horse is yonder sun, and those bricks are the same as all these creatures (on earth): thus even as he makes (the horse) smell, so yon sun kisses these creatures . And hence, by Pragâpati's power, every one now thinks, 'I am!' And as to why he makes it smell while going westward, it is because, whilst going (from east) to west, that (sun) kisses all these creatures.
3	2	13	And, again, why he makes it smell;--that horse is yonder sun, and those naturally-perforated (bricks) are these worlds; and even as he makes it smell, so yonder sun strings these worlds to himself on a thread . And as to that thread, the significance of that (will be explained) further on.
3	2	14	And, again, why he makes it smell; Agni went away from the gods; he entered the water. The gods said to Pragâpati, 'Go thou in search of him: to thee, his own father, he will reveal himself.' He became a white horse, and went in search of him. He found him on a lotus leaf, having crept forth from the water. He eyed him, and he (Agni) scorched him: hence the white horse has, as it were, a scorched mouth , and indeed is apt to become weak-eyed. He (Agni) thought he had hit and hurt him, and said to him, 'I grant thee a boon!'
3	2	15	He (Pragâpati) said, 'Whoever shall seek thee in that form (of a white horse), shall find thee!' And, accordingly, he who seeks him (Agni) in that form, finds him; and having found him, he then builds him up.
3	2	16	It should be a white (horse), for that is a form of him (the sun) who burns yonder. If he cannot obtain a white one, one that is not white might do; but a horse it should be. If he cannot obtain a horse, even an ox might do, for the ox is of Agni's nature, and Agni is the repeller of all evils.
3	2	17	Now, then, as to the mounting  (of the altar). Now some mount it from the front (east) towards the back, or from the back towards the front: let him not do so; for that Agni (the fire-altar) is an animal; and if one mounts an animal (ox) from the front towards the back, it strikes him with its horns; and if he mounts it from the back towards the front, it does so with its feet. Let him mount it only by the middle body ; for the animal which people mount by the (middle) body, carries them forward, and does not hurt them. From the left (north) side (he should mount it), for any animal which people mount they mount from the left side. By mounting the (body of the) altar from the left side, and performing the work connected with the Uttara-vedi, he takes hold of Agni in the (middle) body (or, into himself); and having taken Agni into his own self, he sings the 'true hymn.' He puts a lotus-leaf on (the altar): thereof further on.
3	2	18	Now that horse they lead about when evening is closing in; for at that time the gods were afraid lest the Rakshas, the fiends, should there smite that (Agni, or altar) of theirs. They made that thunderbolt, to wit, yonder sun, his protector, for that horse is yonder sun; and in like manner does this one now make that thunderbolt his (Agni's) protector.
3	2	19	He leads it about towards the setting of the sun; for he (the sun) is manifestly his protector by day; and the Rakshas are the associates of thenight: for the night he thus makes that thunderbolt his protector. He leads it about on every side: on every side he thus makes that thunderbolt his protector. Thrice he leads it about: he thus makes that thunderbolt his (Agni's) threefold protector. He then lets it loose towards north-west: the purport of this has been explained. It afterwards returns (to the sacrificial ground): the purport of this (will be explained) further on.
4	1	1	Being about to build Agni (the fire-altar), he takes him up into his own self; for from out of his own self he causes him to be born, and wherefrom one is born, suchlike he becomes. Now were he to build up Agni without taking him up into his own self, he would beget man from man, mortal from mortal, one not freed from sin from one not freed from sin; but when he builds up Agni after taking him up into his own self, he causes Agni to be born from Agni, the immortal from the immortal, the sinless from the sinless.
4	1	2	He takes him in , 'Within me I first take Agni,' he thereby first takes Agni into his own self;--'for increase of wealth, for healthy progeny, for vigorous manhood!' and hereby he takes all blessings to himself;--'and may the deities stand by me!' and hereby he takes all the gods to himself; and thus he takes into his own self all that he is about to generate from his own self. Having taken Agniinto his own self whilst standing, he builds him up sitting;--Agni is an animal: hence the animal, having received the foetus standing, gives birth after lying down.
4	1	3	He now sings the Satya Sâman  (true hymn). For the gods then said, 'Let us make the truth (satya) his mouth (or beginning): thus we shall become the truth, truth will turn unto us, and true will become that wish of ours for which we are about to perform this rite!'
4	1	4	They sang that 'true hymn' at the outset, and thus made the truth his (Agni's) mouth; and they became the truth; the truth turned unto them, and true became that wish of theirs for which they performed this rite.
4	1	5	And in like manner when the Sacrificer now, at the outset, sings the 'true hymn,' he thereby makes the truth his (Agni's) mouth; and he (himself) becomes the truth; and truth turns unto him; and true becomes that wish of his for which he performs this rite.
4	1	6	Now that truth is the same as the waters, for the waters are the truth. Hence they say, 'Whereby  the waters flow, that is a form of the truth.' It is the waters indeed that were made first of this universe: hence when the waters (rains) flow, then everything whatsoever exists is produced here.
4	1	7	He then puts down a lotus-leaf (in the centre ofthe altar-site);--the lotus-leaf is a womb: he hereby puts a womb to it (for Agni to be born from).
4	1	8	And, again, why he puts down a lotus-leaf;--the lotus means the waters, and this earth is a leaf thereof: even as the lotus-leaf here lies spread on the water, so this earth lies spread on the waters. Now this same earth is Agni's womb, for Agni (the fire-altar) is this earth, since thereof the whole Agni is built up: it is this earth he thus lays down. He lays it down so as not to be separated from the truth: he thereby establishes this earth on the truth;--hence this earth is established on the truth; and hence the truth is this earth, for this earth is the most certain of these worlds.
4	1	9	'The waters’ back thou art, the womb of Agni,' for this earth is indeed the back of the waters, and the womb of Agni;--'around the swelling ocean,' for the ocean indeed swells around this earth;--'growing great on the lotus,' that is, 'growing, flourish thou on the lotus;'--'spread out with the extent, with the breadth, of the sky!' with this he strokes along (the leaf),--for this Agni is yonder sun, and no other extent but that of the sky is able to contain him: he thus says (to the leaf), Having become the sky, contain him! He lays it down with a Svarâg verse, for self-rule (svârâgya) belongs to the waters. Having 'settled' it, he pronounces the Sûdadohas  upon it: the significance of this has been explained.
4	1	10	He then puts the gold plate  thereon. Nowthis gold plate is yonder sun, for he shines over all the creatures here on earth; and 'rokas' (shine) they mystically call 'rukma' (gold plate), for the gods love the mystic: he thus lays down yonder sun (on the altar). It is golden, and round, with one and twenty knobs,--the significance of this has been explained. He puts it down with the knobs pointing downward; for the knobs are his (the sun's) rays, and his rays (shine) downwards.
4	1	11	He puts it down on the lotus-leaf;--the lotus-leaf is a womb: in the womb he thus places him (Agni).
4	1	12	And, again, why he puts it on the lotus-leaf;--the lotus-leaf is a foundation, for the lotus-leaf is this earth, and this earth is the foundation: he who is not settled on this earth, is unsettled even as one who is far away. Now by means of his rays that (sun) is settled on this earth: he thus settles him (Agni) on this earth, as his foundation.
4	1	13	And, again, why he puts it on the lotus-leaf. When Indra had smitten Vritra, he, thinking that he had not laid him low, entered the waters. He said to them, 'I am afraid: make ye a stronghold for me!' Now what essence of the waters there was that they gathered upwards (on the surface), and made it a stronghold for him; and because they made (kar) a stronghold (pûh) for him, therefore it is 'pûshkara;' 'pûshkara' being what is mystically called 'push-kara' (lotus-leaf), for the gods love the mystic. Now when he puts it (the gold plate) on the lotus-leaf, he then establishes him (Agni) in that essence which the waters gathered together for him (Indra), and in that stronghold which they made for him.
4	1	14	'The Brahman first born in front;' the Brahman doubtless is yonder sun, and he is born day by day in front (in the east);--'from the summit  he, the longing, overspread the shining,' the summit doubtless is the middle, the shining ones are these worlds, and the longing one is yonder sun,--he is the longing one inasmuch as he longed to be born; and in rising he overspreads  these (worlds) from the summit, from the middle;--'he (overspread) the nighest extents of the deep,' his nighest extents of the deep doubtless are the regions, for he (the sun) does extend nigh to them;--'the womb of the existent and of the non-existent did he overspread!' the womb of the existent and of the non-existent doubtless are these worlds; for both what exists and what does not exist is born from these worlds. He puts it on with a trishtubh verse, for yonder (sun) is related to the Trishtubh . Having 'settled' it, he pronounces the Sûdadohas  verse upon it: the significance of this has been explained.
4	1	15	He then lays the (gold) man thereon,--he is Pragâpati, he is Agni, he is the Sacrificer. He is made of gold, for gold is light, and fire is light; gold is immortality, and fire is immortality. It is a man (purusha), for Pragâpati is the Man.
4	1	16	And, again, why he lays down the man. When Pragâpati was relaxed, his pleasing form went out from within; when it had gone out of him, the gods left him. When the gods restored him, they put that pleasing form into him, and the gods were pleased with that (form) of his; and inasmuch as the gods were pleased (ram) with that pleasing (ramya) form of his, it is called 'hiramya;' 'hiramya' being what is mystically called 'hiranya' (gold), for the gods love the mystic. And in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now put that pleasing form into him (Agni), and the gods are pleased with that (form) of his. But that pleasing form of his is the vital air: it is that vital air he thus puts into him.
4	1	17	He lays him on the gold plate, for the gold plate is yonder sun: that same man who is in that (sun's) disk, it is him he now lays down (on the altar).
4	1	18	He lays him down on his back ;--for the gods at that time said, 'If we lay down these two  both looking hitherwards, they will burn up everything here; and if (we lay) both so as to be turned away from here, they will give warmth only in the opposite direction; and if facing each other, then there will be light only between those two, and they will injure each other.' They laid down the one so as to look hitherwards, and the other so as to look away from here: that one (the sun), the gold disk, looking downwards, gives warmth by his rays, andthat man (tends) upward by his vital airs . He lays him down (with the head) towards the east, for (with the head) towards the east this Agni (the fire-altar) is built up.
4	1	19	'Hiranyagarbha came first into existence,' for that golden child did come first into existence;--'born he was the one lord of being;' for he indeed was born as the one lord of all this being;--'he upholdeth this earth and the sky,' for he (the sun) does uphold both the sky and the earth;--'to the god Ka let us do homage by offering!' Ka (Who?) is Pragâpati: thus, 'let us do homage to Him by offering!'
4	1	20	'The drop leaped along the earth and sky;' the drop is yonder sun, and he leaps both to the sky and to the earth--thus (in rising) to that (sky), and thus (in setting) to this (earth);--'along this seat, and that which was afore;' that is, to this world, and to that one; or this (Âhavanîya altar) which is now being built, and that (Gârhapatya altar) which yonder was built before;--'(the drop) moving along the common seat;' for he (the sun) moves along that common seat;--'the drop I offer along the seven hotrâs;' the drop is yonder sun; and the seven hotrâs are the regions: he thus establishes yonder sun in the regions.
4	1	21	With two (verses) he lays him down;--two-footed is the Sacrificer, and the Sacrificer is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus lays him down;--with two trishtubhverses, for he (the sun) is related to the Trishtubh. Having 'settled' him, he pronounces the Sûdadohas on him: the significance of this has been explained.
4	1	22	He then sings a Sâman. For the gods, having laid down that man, then saw him (looking) even suchlike as yonder dry plank.
4	1	23	They said, 'Think ye upon this, how we may put vigour into this man!' They said, 'Meditate ye (ketay)!' whereby, doubtless, they meant to say, 'Seek ye to build up (kitim ish)! seek ye how we shall put vigour into this man!'
4	1	24	Whilst meditating, they saw this Sâman, and sang it, and thereby put vigour into him; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) thereby put it into him: he sings on the man, he puts vigour into the man;--he sings on the bright one , for Agni is all bright things. After he has laid him down, let him not walk round him in front, lest that Agni should injure him.
4	1	25	He (the Sacrificer) then stands by (the gold man) worshipping him with the Sarpanâma (serpent-named) formulas. The serpents doubtless are these worlds, for these glide along (sarp) with everything here whatsoever there is; and Agni is no other than the self (body) of all the gods. They, the gods, having laid down (on the altar) that self of theirs, were afraid lest these worlds should glide away with that self of theirs.
4	1	26	They saw those Sarpanâma and worshipped with them; by these (verses) they stopped these worlds for him, and caused them to bend themselves; and because they caused them to bend (nam) themselves,therefore (the formulas are called) Sarpanâma. And in like manner does the Sacrificer, when he stands by worshipping with the Sarpanâma formulas, stop these worlds for him, and cause these worlds to bend themselves; and so they do not glide away with that self of his.
4	1	27	And, again, why he stands by worshipping with the Sarpanâma formulas;--the serpents are these worlds, for whatever creeps (sarp), creeps in these worlds. Now when he worships with the Sarpanâma formulas--whatever fiend there is in these worlds, whatever devourer, whatever ogress,--all that he thereby appeases.
4	1	28	'Homage be to the serpents, whichever are on earth, and they that are in the air, and they that are in the sky, to those serpents be homage!' whatever serpents there are in these three worlds to them he thereby does homage.
4	1	29	'They that are the darts of demons,' for some (of the serpents), sent by demons, bite;--'and those on the trees, and those which lie in holes, to those serpents be homage!' he thereby does homage to the serpents that lie both in trees, and in holes.
4	1	30	'Or those that are in the luminous sphere of the sky; or those in the rays of the sun; those by which abode is made in the waters, to those serpents be homage!' he hereby does homage to them wheresoever they are. He does so by 'homage, homage,' for homage is sacrifice (worship): by sacrifice, by homage, he thus worships them. Let him therefore not say 'homage be to thee,' to one not worthy of sacrifice, for itwould be just as if he said 'sacrifice (or, worship) be to thee!'
4	1	31	With three (formulas) he worships,--three are these worlds, and threefold, also, is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus stops these worlds (from moving); and by so much does he appease everything here. Standing he worships, for these worlds stand, as it were; and besides, while standing one is stronger.
4	1	32	Thereupon, having sat down he offers on (the gold man) with fivefold-taken ghee,--the significance of this has been explained. On each side (of the fire he offers), moving round: he thus gratifies him (Agni) with food from all quarters.
4	1	33	And, again, why he offers thereon. The gods, having laid down that body of theirs, now were afraid lest the Rakshas, the fiends, should smite that (body) of theirs. They saw those Rakshas-killing counter-charms ,--, 'Put forth thy power, like a broad army!' slayers of Rakshas are the counter-charms: having, by means of these counter-charms, repelled the Rakshas, the fiends, in every quarter, they (the gods) restored that body in a place free from danger and devilry; and in like manner this Sacrificer, having, by means of these counter-charms, repelled the Rakshas, the fiends, in every quarter, now restores that body (of Agni) in a place free from danger and devilry.
4	1	34	He offers with ghee; for the ghee is a thunderbolt: by the thunderbolt he thus repels the Rakshas, the fiends;--with fivefold-taken (ghee),--of five layers consists the fire-altar; five seasons are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus repels the Rakshas, the fiends;--with (five) verses addressed to Agni, for the Rakshas-killing light is Agni: by Agni he thus repels the Rakshas, the fiends;--with trishtubh verses,--the Trishtubh is a thunderbolt: by the thunderbolt he thus repels the Rakshas, the fiends. On each side (he offers) moving round: in every quarter he thus repels the Rakshas, the fiends.
4	1	35	Behind the altar (he offers) while seated with his face towards the east; then on the left (north) side (looking) to the south; then in front (looking) to the west; then going round behind, (he offers) on the right (south) side while sitting with his face towards the north. Thus (he moves) to the right, forthat (leads) to the gods. Thereupon, going back, (he offers) while sitting behind, with his face towards the east; and in this way that performance of his takes place towards the east .
4	1	36	He then lays down two offering-spoons,--the offering-spoons are arms : it is his arms he thus restores to him (Agni). And as to why offering-spoons (are laid down), it is because the arms are offering-spoons,--that bowl and the handle are two, for there are two of these arms. He lays them down at the (left and right) sides, for these arms (of ours) are at the sides.
4	1	37	On the right (south) side he lays down one of kârshmarya (gmelina arborea) wood. For at that time the gods were afraid lest the Rakshas, the fiends, should destroy their sacrifice from the south. They saw that Rakshas-killing tree, the Kârshmarya: having by that tree repelled the Rakshas, the fiends, on the south, they spread that sacrifice in a place free from danger and devilry. And in like manner the Sacrificer, having by that tree repelled the Rakshas, the fiends, on the south, now spreads that sacrifice in a place free from danger and devilry. It (the spoon) is filled with ghee;--the ghee is a thunderbolt: it is by the thunderbolt he thus repels the Rakshas, the fiends, on the south.
4	1	38	On the left (north) side he then lays down one of udumbara (ficus glomerata) wood; for the Udumbara means strength, life-sap: strength, life-sap he thus puts into him. It is filled with sourcurds,--sour curds are life-sap: it is life-sap he thus puts into him.
4	1	39	And, again, why he lays down two offering-spoons. When Pragâpati was relaxed, Agni took his (Pragâpati's) fiery spirit, and carried it off to the south, and there stopped; and because after carrying (karsh) it off he stopped (ud-ram), therefore the Kârshmarya (sprang up). And Indra took his (Pragâpati's) vigour and went away to the north: it became the Udumbara tree.
4	1	40	He (Pragâpati) said to those two, 'Come ye to me, and put back into me that (substance) of mine wherewith ye have gone off!'--'Well then, bestow thou all food here on us two!' they said.--'Well then, join me, becoming these two arms of mine!'--'So be it!' He bestowed all food on them, and they joined him, becoming those two arms of his: hence it is by the arms that food is made, and by means of the arms that it is eaten, for he (Pragâpati) bestowed all food on the two arms.
4	1	41	The kârshmarya one he lays down on the right side, with , 'By Agni's fiery spirit I settle thee!'--that fiery spirit of his (Pragâpati's) which Agni then took and carried off to the south, he now puts back into him.--'Agni, the head, the summit of the sky, he, the lord of the earth, animates the seeds of the waters,' for Agni indeed is this (spoon). With a Gâyatrî verse (he performs),--Agni is Gâyatra: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus lays down that (spoon). It is filled with ghee, for ghee belongs to Agni: with his own share, with his own life-sap he thus gratifies him.
4	1	42	He then lays down the udumbara one on theleft (north) side, with , 'By Indra's vigour I settle thee!' that vigour of his (Pragâpati's) which Indra then took and went away to the north, he now puts back into him.--, 'Thou hast become the leader of the sacrifice, and of the sphere to which thou tendest with propitious teams; the light-giving head hast thou lifted to the sky; thy tongue, O Agni, hast thou made the bearer of the offering;'--Indra indeed is this (spoon). And as to its being a verse addressed to Agni, it is because it is the performance of Agni (the fire-altar);--and a trishtubh one, because Indra is connected with the Trishtubh; and Agni includes Indra and Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus lays it down. Moreover, all the gods are Indra and Agni, and Agni belongs to all the deities: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus lays it down. It is filled with sour curds, for sour curds belong to Indra: with his own share, with his own life-sap he thus gratifies him.
4	1	43	Indra and Agni indeed are those two arms of his (Pragâpati's): they join him with fiery spirit and vigour. Where he (the Sacrificer) touches (the ground with his arms), whilst viewing intently the gold man with his breast close to him , there he (the Adhvaryu) makes a mark and lays down those (spoons); for that is the place of those two (arms).
4	1	44	Now some lay them down sideways (from south to north), saying, 'Sideways run these two arms (of ours).' Let him not do so, but let him lay them with the bowl towards the front (east), for this Agni (altar) is built with the head towards the front; and, besides, in this way the arms are stronger. Separately he lays them down, separately he 'settles' them, and separately he pronounces the Sûdadohas verse on them; for separate are these two arms.
4	1	45	As to this they say, 'Let him make no arms to this (gold) man , lest he should cause him to be redundant; for these two spoons are (in lieu of) his arms.' Let him nevertheless make (him with arms), for those two spoons are (merely) after the manner of the two arms. Moreover, those two (arms of Agni) are wings; and whatever forms, whatever stomas, whatever prishthas, whatever metres he will be applying to that fire-altar, that will be the perfection, that will be the growth of those two: let him therefore make arms to that (gold) man.
4	2	1	He puts a Svayam-âtrinnâ (naturally-perforated brick) on (the gold man);--the (first) naturally-perforated one being this earth, he thus puts this earth thereon. He puts it on so as not to be separate from the man; for the naturally-perforated one means food, and the naturally-perforated one means this earth, and this earth is food, since it is on her that all food ripens: he thus places food close to him (the man, Agni). Upon (the man he puts it): he thus places the food upon him .
4	2	2	And, again, why he puts on a naturally-perforated one;--the naturally-perforated (brick) is the breath (or vital air), for the breath thus bores itself (svayam âtrintte) through the body: it is breath he thus bestows on it. He puts it so as not to be separate from the man; for the naturally-perforated one is the breath, and the naturally-perforated one is this earth, and this earth is the breath, since this earth bears everything that breathes: he thus puts the breath so as not to be separate from him. Upon (the man he places the brick): he thus puts the breath upon him .
4	2	3	And, again, why he puts thereon the naturally-perforated one. The deities, taking up the disjointed Pragâpati, separated; and, having obtained a resting-place in them, thus separated, he settled down.
4	2	4	Now that Pragâpati who became disjointed is this very Agni (fire-altar) that is now being built up; and that resting-place (or, foundation) is this firstnaturally-perforated (brick);--thus when he now puts it on, he thereby puts upon this (altar-site) that (foundation ) which there was for his body: that is why he now puts it on.
4	2	5	He puts it on by means of Pragâpati, for Pragâpati thereby took back to himself (that foundation) of his body.  'Steady thou art,' that is, 'Firm thou art, or established thou art;'--'supporting,' for that which supports is a foundation;--'laid down by Visvakarman;' Visvakarman is Pragâpati, thus, 'laid down by that one;'--'May the ocean, may the bird not injure thee!' the ocean doubtless is the gold plate, and the bird is the man: thus, 'May those two not injure thee!'--'Not shaking, steady thou the earth!' as the text, so the meaning.
4	2	6	'May Pragâpati settle thee'--for Pragâpati saw this first layer ;--'on the back of the waters, on the way of the ocean,' the back of the waters doubtless is this earth, and the way of the ocean is this earth;--'thee, the wide, the broad one!' for this earth is both wide and broad;--'broaden thou: thou art the broad one!' that is, 'broaden thou, and thou art the broad (earth, prithivî).'
4	2	7	'Thou art the earth (bhû),' for this is the earth;--'thou art the ground (bhûmi),' for this is the ground;--'Thou art Aditi,'--Aditi is this earth, for this earth gives (dad)everything here;--'the all-containing,' for on this earth everything is contained;--'supporter of all the world,' that is, supporter of the whole world;--'sustain the earth, steady the earth, injure not the earth!' that is, sustain thyself, steady thyself, injure, not thyself!
4	2	8	'For all breathing, out-breathing, through-breathing, and up-breathing;' for the naturally-perforated (brick) is the breath, and the breath serves for all that;--'for a resting-place, for a moving-place;' the naturally-perforated (bricks) are these worlds , and these worlds are the resting-place, the moving-place;--'May Agni guard thee'--that is, may Agni protect thee!--'with mighty well-being!' that is, with great well-being;--'with the safest roof,' that is, with whatever roof (abode) is the safest. Having 'settled' it , he pronounces the Sûdadohas  on it: the meaning of this has been explained. He then sings a Sâman: the meaning of this (will be explained) further on.
4	2	9	Here now they say, 'How is it that that (gold) man is not held (weighed) down by the naturally-perforated (brick) ?' Well, the naturally-perforated (brick) is food and breath; and man is not held down either by food or by his breath.
4	2	10	He then lays the Darya-brick  thereon;--the Dûrvâ-brick being cattle; it is with cattle hethus endows it: these are the same cattle together with which Agni on that former occasion approached ; it is them he now puts thereon. He lays it down immediately on the naturally-perforated (brick); the naturally-perforated (brick) being this earth, he thus places the cattle immediately on this earth. Upon (the brick he places it): upon this earth he thereby places cattle.
4	2	11	And, again, why he lays down the Dûrvâ-brick. The hair of Pragâpati which were lying on the ground when he was disjointed became these herbs. The vital air then went out from within him, and, that having gone out, he fell down.
4	2	12	He said, 'Verily, this (vital air) has undone me!' and because he said, 'it has undone (dhûrv) me,' hence (the name) 'dhûrvâ;' 'dhûrvâ' doubtless being what is mystically called 'dûrvâ,' for the gods love the mystic. That (dûrvâ grass) is the ruling power (Kshatra), for it is this vital sap, the breath; and the other plants are the hair: in laying down that (dûrvâ plant) he lays down all (kinds of) plants.
4	2	13	When the gods restored him, they put that life-sap, the breath, inside him; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now put it into him. He lays it down immediately on the naturally-perforated (brick); the naturally-perforated one being this earth, he thus places the plants immediately on this earth. Upon (the brick he lays it): upon this earth he thus places the plants. It should be with root and top, for completeness' sake. Let him lay it on in such manner that while lying on the naturally-perforated (brick) it touches the ground (with itstops) , for on this earth those (plants) spring up, and along her they grow.
4	2	14	He lays it on, with , 'Growing up joint by joint, knot by knot;' for joint by joint, and knot by knot that (grass) does grow up;--'so do thou prolong us, O Dûrvâ (plant), by a thousand, and a hundred (descendants)!' as the text, so its meaning.
4	2	15	'Thou that spreadest by a hundred, and branchest out by a thousand (shoots);' for by a hundred (shoots) it spreads, and by a thousand it branches out;--'to thee, O divine brick, we will do homage by offering;' as the text, so the meaning. With two (verses) he puts it on: the meaning of this has been explained. Having 'settled' it, he pronounces the Sûdadohas upon it: the meaning of this has been explained.
4	2	16	He then puts down a Dviyagus  (brick). Indra and Agni desired, 'May we go to the heavenly world!' They saw that dviyagus brick, even this earth, and laid it down; and having laid it down, they went to the heavenly world from that foundation. In like manner when this Sacrificer lays down a dviyagus (brick), (he does so) thinking, 'I want to go to the heavenly world by the same means (rûpa), by performing the same rite by which Indra and Agni went to the heavenly world!' And as to its being called 'dviyagus,' it is because two deities saw it. And as to why he lays down a dviyagus one: the dviyagus doubtless is the Sacrificer.
4	2	17	Here now they say, 'If (the dviyagus) is that same Sacrificer who is that gold man, which then is that (real) form of his?' Well, that (gold man) is his divine body, and this (brick) is his human one. As to that gold man, that is his immortal form, his divine form; gold being immortal. And as to this (brick) being made of clay, it is because this is his human form.
4	2	18	Now were he only to lay down that (golden man), and not to let this dviyagus (brick) remain , the Sacrificer surely would quickly pass away from this world; but now that he allows this (brick) to remain, he thereby leaves to him this human form of his; and so he attains with this body the full (measure of) life.
4	2	19	And were he not to put it on after (the gold man), he assuredly would not afterwards find out that divine body ; but now that he puts it on thereafter, he does so afterwards find out that divine body. He lays it down close to the dûrvâ-brick the dûrvâ-brick being cattle, he thus establishes the Sacrificer in (the possession of) cattle.
4	2	20	Here now they say, 'How do those two bodies of his come to be connected together by the breath, and not severed?' Well, the naturally-perforated (brick) is the breath, and the dûrvâ-brick is the breath, and the dviyagus (-brick) is the Sacrificer:and inasmuch as he lays down the dûrvâ-brick close to the naturally-perforated one, he thereby connects and joins breath with breath; and inasmuch as he lays down the dviyagus one close to the dûrvâ-brick--the dûrvâ-brick being the breath, and the dviyagus the Sacrificer--those two bodies of his (the human one and the divine one) thus become connected together by the breath, and not severed.
4	2	21	'O Agni, what lights of thine in the sun overspread the sky by their beams, with all those help us to light and to people!--O ye gods, what lights of yours are in the sun, and what lights are in kine and horses, O Indra and Agni, with all those bestow light upon us, O Brihaspati!' for 'light' he prays each time: light being immortality, it is immortality he thus bestows on him (Agni, and the Sacrificer). With two (verses) he lays it down: the significance of this has been explained. And, moreover, it is because that material form (of the brick) is a twofold one, (consisting as it does of) clay and water. Having 'settled' it, he pronounces the Sûdadohas upon it: the significance of this has been explained.
4	2	22	He then lays down two Retahsik (seed-shedding bricks);--the seed-shedders doubtless are these two worlds, for these two worlds do shed seed;--this (terrestrial world) sheds seed upwards from here (in the form of) smoke; it becomes rain in yonder world, and that rain yonder world (sheds) from above: hence (creatures) are born within these two worlds, and therefore these two worlds are seed-shedders.
4	2	23	'The wide-ruling one contained the light;' the wide-ruling ones doubtless is this (terrestrial) world: it contains this fire, the light.--'The self-ruling one contained the light,' the self-ruling  one doubtless is yonder world: it contains yonder sun, the light. And the wide-ruling one and the self-ruling one being these two worlds, he lays them down separately, for separate are these two worlds. He 'settles' them once: he thereby makes them one and the same (or, joined together), whence the ends of these two worlds meet.
4	2	24	And, again, why he lays down two seed-shedders; the seed-shedders are the testicles, for only he who has testicles sheds seed. 'The wide-ruling one contained the light;--the self-ruling one contained the light,' he says; for the wide-ruling and the self-ruling ones are the testicles: they contain that light, the seed, Pragâpati. He lays them down separately, for separate are these testicles. He 'settles' them once: he thereby makes them one and the same, whence they have a common connecting-part. He lays them down close to the dviyagus (brick) : the dviyagus being the Sacrificer, he thus puts the testicles together with the Sacrificer.
4	2	25	He then lays down a Visvagyotis (all-light brick) ;--the first 'all-light' (brick)  is Agni, for Agniis all the light in this (terrestrial) world: it is Agni he thus lays down. He lays it down close to the seed-shedding ones,--the seed-shedding ones being these two worlds, he thus places Agni together with these two worlds. He lays it down between (the two Retahsik ), for Agni (the fire) is within these two worlds.
4	2	26	And, again, why he lays down an 'all-light' (brick);--the 'all-light' (brick) is progeny, for progeny is all the light: he thus lays generative power (into Agni). He lays it down so as not to be separated from the seed-shedding (bricks),--the seed-shedders being the testicles, he thus makes the generative power inseparable from the testicles. He lays it down between (those two), for within the testicles progeny is produced.
4	2	27	'May Pragâpati settle thee'--for Pragâpati saw this first layer ;--'on the back of the earth, thee the brilliant one!' for on the back of the earth this brilliant Agni indeed is.
4	2	28	'For all breathing, out-breathing, through-breathing,'--the all-light (brick) is breath, and breath is (necessary) for this entire universe;--'give all the light!' that is, 'give the whole light;'--'Agni is thine over-lord,' he thus makes Agni the over-lord of this earth. Having 'settled' it , hepronounces the Sûdadohas upon it: the significance of this has been explained.
4	2	29	He then lays down two Ritavya (seasonal bricks);--the two seasonal (bricks) being the same as the seasons, it is the seasons he thus lays down.  'Madhu and Mâdhava, the two spring seasons,'--these are the names of those two: it is thus by their names that he lays them down. There are two (such) bricks, for two months are a season. He 'settles' them once : he thereby makes (the two months) one season.
4	2	30	And as to why he now lays down these two;--this Agni (fire-altar) is the year, and the year is these worlds; the first layer is this (terrestrial) world thereof, and the spring season also is this world thereof; and when he now lays down those two (bricks), he thereby puts back into him (Agni-Pragâpati) what those two (the first layer and the spring) are to that body of his : this is why he now lays down those two (bricks).
4	2	31	And, again, why he now lays down these two;--this Agni is Pragâpati, and Pragâpati is the year; the first layer is his foundation, and the spring season also is his foundation;--thus when he now lays down these two (bricks), he thereby puts back into him what those two are to that body of his: this is why he now lays down those two (bricks). He lays them down close to the 'all-light' brick: the 'all-light' brick being progeny, he thus lays progeny close together with the seasons; whence progeny is produced in accordance with the seasons, for by seasons people compute (the age of man)whilst in the state of embryo, and by seasons when he is born.
4	2	32	He then lays down the Ashâdhâ (invincible brick) ,--the 'invincible one' being this earth, it is this earth he thus lays down. He puts it on the fore-part (of the altar-site), for this earth was created first.
4	2	33	And as to its being called Ashâdhâ. The gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pragâpati, strove together. The gods saw this invincible brick, even this earth; they put it on (the altar); and having put it on, they conquered (and drove) the Asuras, the enemies, the rivals, from this universe; and inasmuch as (thereby) they conquered (asahanta), it is called Ashâdhâ. In like manner the Sacrificer, after putting on that (brick), conquers (and drives) his spiteful rival from this universe (or, from everything here).
4	2	34	And, again, why he lays down the Ashâdhâ. The Ashâdhâ is speech, and by speech  the gods then indeed conquered (and drove) the Asuras, the enemies, the rivals, from this universe; and in like manner the Sacrificer, by means of speech, conquers (and drives) his spiteful rival from this universe: it was speech the gods then laid down (or bestowed on Agni), and in like manner the Sacrificer now lays down speech.
4	2	35	This earth is the bearer of what is desirable; for--the desirable being the vital airs--this earth bears everything that breathes, and for that reason this earth is the bearer of what is desirable. Butspeech (the mouth) also indeed is the bearer of what is desirable; for the desirable is the vital airs, and for the (channels of) the vital airs food is put into the mouth: therefore speech is the bearer of what is desirable.
4	2	36	Now the Ashâdhâ is the same as those vital airs; he lays it down in the fore-part (of the altar): he thus bestows (on Agni the organs of) the vital airs in front; whence there are here (organs of) the vital airs in front (of the body). Let him not in this layer enclose this (Ashâdhâ) in front by any other brick which has a special prayer of its own, lest he close up (the organs of) the vital airs.
4	2	37	And as to why he lays down in front five Apasyâs ,--water (ap) is food, and by food (the organs of) the vital airs are not closed up. He lays down (the Ashâdhâ) close to the two seasonal ones: he thereby establishes speech in the seasons, and hence speech (the mouth) speaks here, firmly established in the seasons.
4	2	38	Here now they say, 'If the Visvagyotis (brick) is progeny, and the Ashâdhâ speech, why does he put the two seasonal ones between them?' Well, the seasonal ones being the year, he thus separates speech from progeny by the year, and hence children utter speech at the time (or age) of a year.
4	2	39	'Thou art Ashâdhâ, the conquering,' for the gods thereby conquered the Asuras,--'conquer the enemies! conquer the hostile!' as the text, so the meaning;--'thou hast a thousand energies: do thou speed me!' a thousand meansall: thus, 'thou hast all energies, do thou speed me!' When he has 'settled' it, he pronounces the Sûdadohas on it: the significance of this has been explained.
4	2	40	Here now they say, 'Why are those other bricks placed in front of the naturally-perforated one?' Let him say, There are two wombs (birthplaces)--the one being the womb of the gods, the other the womb of men: the gods have their birthplace in the east, and men in the west; and when he lays down those (bricks) in front, he thereby causes the Sacrificer to be born from the womb of the gods.
5	1	1	He then puts down a (living) tortoise;--the tortoise means life-sap: it is life-sap (blood) he thus bestows on (Agni). This tortoise is that life-sap of these worlds which flowed away from them when plunged into the waters : that (life-sap) he now bestows on (Agni). As far as the life-sap extends, so far the body extends: that (tortoise) thus is these worlds.
5	1	2	That lower shell of it is this (terrestrial) world; it is, as it were, fixed; for fixed, as it were, is this (earth-)world. And that upper shell of it is yonder sky; it has its ends, as it were, bent down; for yonder sky has its ends, as it were, bent down. And what is between (the shells) is the air;--that (tortoise) thus is these worlds: it is these worlds he thus lays down (to form part of the altar).
5	1	3	He anoints it with sour curds, honey, and ghee,--sour curds doubtless are a form of this (earth-)world,ghee of the air, and honey of yonder sky: he thus supplies it (the tortoise) with its own form. Or, sour curds are the life-sap of this (earth-)world, ghee that of the air, and honey that of yonder sky: he thus supplies it with its own life-sap.
5	1	4	'Honey the winds pour forth for the righteous, honey the rivers; full of honey may the plants be for us!--Honey by night and morn, rich in honey may the region of the earth be for us, honey the father Heaven!--rich in honey may the tree be for us, rich in honey the sun, full of honey the kine!' To whatever deity a Rik-verse, and to whatever (deity) a Yagus formula applies, that very deity the verse is, and that very deity the sacrificial formula is . This triplet then is honey (madhu); and honey being life-sap, it is life-sap he thus puts into him (Agni). With three Gâyatrî verses (he performs): the significance of this has been explained.
5	1	5	And as to its being called 'kûrma' (tortoise);Pragâpati, having assumed that form, created living beings. Now what he created, he made; and inasmuch as he made (kar), he is (called) 'kûrma;' and 'kûrma' being (the same as) 'kasyapa' (a tortoise), therefore all creatures are said to be descended from Kasyapa.
5	1	6	Now this tortoise is the same as yonder sun: it is yonder sun he thus lays down (on the altar). He lays it down in front with the head towards the back (west): he thus places yonder sun in the eastlooking thitherwards (or moving westward); and hence yonder sun is placed in the east looking thitherwards. On the right (south) of the Ashâdhâ (he places it), for the tortoise (kûrma, masc.) is a male, and the Ashâdhâ a female, and the male lies on the right side of the female;--at a cubit's distance , for at a cubit's distance the male lies by the female. That Ashâdhâ is the consecrated queen (mahishî) of all the bricks, hence being on the right (south) side of her, it (the tortoise) is on the right side of all the bricks.
5	1	7	And, again, why he puts down a tortoise;--the tortoise (kûrma) is the breath, for the breath makes (kar) all these creatures: it is breath he thus puts into him (Agni). He puts it down in front looking towards the back: he thus puts in the breath in front tending towards the back; whence the breath is taken in from the front backwards.  turned towards the (gold) man: he thus puts breath into the Sacrificer. South of the Ashâdhâ (he puts it), for the tortoise is breath, and the Ashâdhâ speech; and the breath (prâna, masc.) is the male, the mate, of speech (vâk, fem.).
5	1	8	Seat thee in the depth of the waters for that indeed is the deepest (place) of the (heavenly) waters where yonder (sun) burns;--'lest the sun, lest Agni Vaisvânara should scorch thee!' that is, lest the Sun, lest Agni Vaisvânara injure thee;--'Overlook the creatures with unbroken wings,' that is, overlook all these uninjured, unharmed creatures, that is, these bricks;--'mayheaven's rain favour thee!' this he says in order that the rain of heaven may favour him.
5	1	9	He then makes it move , with, 'Over the heaven-reaching three oceans he crept,' the three heaven-reaching oceans doubtless are these worlds, and over them he crept in the shape of a tortoise;--'the lord of waters, the bull of the bricks,' for he (the tortoise) indeed is the lord of waters, and the bull of the bricks;--'induing the covering of him, the well-made, in the world,' the covering (purîsha) means the cattle: thus, entering the (form of the) cattle of the well-made (Agni) in the world;--'go thither whither the former have passed away!' that is, go thither whither by this performance former (tortoises) went.
5	1	10	'The mighty sky and the earth,' that is, the great sky and the earth;--'shall mix (prepare) this our sacrifice!' that is, shall favour this sacrifice;--'they shall fill us with nourishments!' that is, they shall nourish us with nourishments! With the last (verse) relating to heaven and earth he puts it down, for the tortoise represents heaven and earth.
5	1	11	With three (formulas) he puts it on (the altar);--three are these worlds, and threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus puts it on. With three (formulas) he anoints it; that makes six: the significance of this (number) has been explained. There are avakâ-plants  below and avakâ-plants above (thetortoise),--the avakâ-plant means water: he thus places it in the midst of water. Having 'settled' it, he pronounces the Sûdadohas upon it: the significance of this has been explained.
5	1	12	He then puts down a mortar and pestle. Vishnu desired, 'May I be an eater of food!' He saw these two bricks, the mortar and pestle. He placed them on (the altar); and by placing them thereon, he became an eater of food. In like manner, when the Sacrificer now places a mortar and pestle thereon, (he does so) thinking, 'I want to be an eater of food by the same means (rûpa), by performing the same rite by which Vishnu became an eater of food.' Now the mortar and pestle mean all (kinds of) food; for by the mortar and pestle food is prepared, and by means of them it is eaten.
5	1	13	He puts them down at the distance of the two retahsik ,--the retahsik being the ribs, and the ribs being the middle: he thus puts food into the middle of him (Agni);--on the north (upper) side (of the central brick): he thus puts the food upon him;--at the distance of a cubit, for from a cubit's distance food is (taken by the hand and) eaten.
5	1	14	They measure a span, for Vishnu, when an embryo, was a span long; and these (mortar and pestle) being food, he thus puts food into him (Agni-Vishnu) proportionate to his body. And indeed the food which is proportionate to the body satisfies,and does no harm; but that which is excessive does harm; and that which is too little does not satisfy.
5	1	15	They are made of Udumbara wood;--the Udumbara (ficus glomerata) being strength, life-sap, he thus puts strength, life-sap into him. And, again, the Udumbara being all the trees, by putting on those two, he puts all trees on (the altar). At the distance of the two retahsik (bricks, he places the mortar and pestle),--the 'seed-shedders' being these two (worlds ), he thus puts the trees in these two (worlds), and hence there are trees in these two (worlds). It (the mortar) is four-cornered,--there being four quarters, he thus places trees in all the quarters; whence there are trees in all the quarters. It is contracted in the middle, to give it the form of a (real) mortar.
5	1	16	And, again, why he places a mortar and pestle thereon. From Pragâpati, when relaxed, the breath wanted to go out from within. He kept it back by means of food: hence the breath is kept back by food, for he who eats food, breathes.
5	1	17	The breath being kept back, the food wanted to go out of him. He kept it back by means of the breath: hence food is kept back by the breath, for he who breathes, eats food.
5	1	18	Those two being kept back, strength wanted to go out of him. He kept it back by those two: hence strength is kept back by those two; for he who eats food, breathes; and to him it gives strength.
5	1	19	Strength being kept back, those two wantedto go out of him. He kept them back by means of strength: hence those two are kept back by strength; for he to whom one gives strength, breathes and eats food.
5	1	20	Those (energies) thus were kept back by one another. Having kept them back by one another, he (Pragâpati) caused them to enter his own self; and that food having entered, all the gods entered along with it; for everything here lives on food.
5	1	21	It is thereto that this verse applies,--'Then, indeed, he became that breath,'--for that breath he then indeed became;--'having become the great Pragâpati,'--for great he indeed then became, when those gods entered him;--'having obtained the benefits, the beneficial,'--the benefits doubtless are the vital airs (breaths), and the beneficial are the food: thus, having obtained all that;--'when he breathed the breaths in the stronghold;'--the stronghold doubtless is the self (body), and inasmuch as he breathed the breaths, the gods are the breaths; and inasmuch as Pragâpati breathed, the breath also is Pragâpati; and verily he who is that breath, he is that Gâyatrî;--and as to that food, that is Vishnu, the deity; and as to that strength, that is the Udumbara (tree).
5	1	22	He said, 'Verily this one has lifted me from out of all evil;' and because he said he has lifted me out (udabhârshît),' hence (the name) 'udumbhara;'--'udumbhara' doubtless being what is mystically called Udumbara, for the gods love the mystic. 'Wide space (uru) shall it make (karat) for me!' he said, hence 'urukara;' 'urukara' doubtless being what is mystically called 'ulûkhala' (the mortar); for the gods love the mystic. Now that mortar isthe birth-place of all breaths; and the birth-place of the breaths being the head-
5	1	23	It (the mortar) is of the measure of a span, for the head is, as it were, of the measure of a span;--four-cornered, for the head is, as it were, four-cornered;--contracted in the middle, for the head is, as it were, contracted in the middle.
5	1	24	Now when the gods restored him (Pragâpati-Agni), they put all that inside him--breath, food, strength; and in like manner this (Sacrificer) now puts that into him. At the distance of the two retahsik (he places it),--the retahsik being the ribs, and the ribs the middle, it is thus in the middle of (or, inside) him that he puts all that.
5	1	25	'Steady thou art, supporting,' the meaning of this has been explained ;--'from here he was at first born, from these wombs, the knower of beings;' for from these wombs the knower of beings (Agni) was indeed born at first;--'by the Gâyatrî, the Trishtubh, and the Anushtubh, may he, the knowing, bear the offering to the gods!'--by means of these metres he, the knowing, indeed bears the offering to the gods.
5	1	31	'For sap, for wealth, do thou rest, for might in glory, for strength, for offspring!' that is, for all that do thou rest!--'all-ruling thou art, self-ruling thou art!' for both all-ruling and self-ruling he (Agni) indeed is;--'may the two Sârasvata wells cheer thee!' Sarasvat (m.) is the Mind, and Sarasvatî (f.) Speech,--these two are the Sârasvata wells: thus, may these two cheer thee! With two (formulas) he sets it down: the significance of this has been explained; and, moreover, twofold is that form, (consisting as it does of) clay and water. Having 'settled' it, he pronounces the Sûdadohas on it: the significance of this has been explained.
5	1	32	He then offers upon it;--now seed was poured into it before, (in the shape of) sand ; that he nowfashions , whence the seed injected into the womb is fashioned. He offers with the dipping-spoon, with 'Hail!' with two Gâyatrî verses relating to Agni: the significance of this has been explained.
5	1	33	'O Agni, harness those good steeds of thine: they draw equal to thy mettle!--Like a chariot-fighter, harness thou the steeds, the best callers of the gods, O Agni! take thy seat as the old Hotri!' with two (verses) containing the (verb) 'yug' (to harness, fasten),--he thus settles that seed injected into the womb, whence the seed settled in the womb does not escape.
5	1	34	If (the fire in the pan) has been carried about for a year , in that case he should now offer; for (the fire) which has been carried about for a year is everything, and that also whereon he offers is everything. But if it has not been carried about for a year, let him only stand by (worshipping) it; for (the fire) which has not been carried about for a year is not everything; and that by which he stands (worshipping) is not everything. Let him nevertheless offer thereon.
5	1	35	Now that Agni is an animal, and even now he is (being) made up whole and complete: the naturally-perforated (brick) is his lower vital air, thedviyagus the hip, the two retahsik the ribs, the visvagyotis the breast-bone, the two seasonal ones the back, the ashâdhâ the neck, the tortoise the head, and the vital airs in the tortoise are those vital airs in the head.
5	1	36	Now that (Agni) he builds upwards from here (as flying) towards the east, and that Agni being yonder sun, he thereby places yonder sun upwards from here in the east; whence yonder sun is placed upwards from here in the east.
5	1	37	He then turns him towards the right ,--he thereby turns yonder sun towards the right, whence yonder sun moves round these worlds (from left) to right.
5	1	38	The fire-pan is the belly, the mortar the womb;--the fire-pan is above, and the mortar below; for the belly is above, and the womb below. The pestle is the sisna; it is round-like, for the sisna is round-like. He places it to the right (south of the mortar), for the male lies on the right side of the female. And what food there is for the consecrated animal, that is the dûrvâ-brick. The left (north) side of that (Agni or altar) is more raised,--that Agni is an animal, and hence the left side of the belly of a well-filled beast is more raised (than the right side).
5	2	1	He puts the heads of the victims in (the fire-pan),--the heads of the victims being animals (or cattle), it is animals he thus puts thereon. He puts them in the fire-pan;--the pan being these worlds, and the heads of the victims being beasts, he thusputs animals in these worlds; whence there are animals in these worlds.
5	2	2	And as to why (he puts the heads) in the fire-pan;--the fire-pan being a womb, and the heads of the victims being animals, he thus establishes the animals in the womb: hence animals, though being eaten and cooked, do not diminish, for he establishes them in the womb.
5	2	3	And, again, why he puts the heads of the victims therein;--what (animal) perfections (srî)  there were, they are these victims’ heads; and what rumps there were, they are those five layers (of the altar). Now those five layers are these worlds, and these worlds are this very fire-pan: thus, when he puts the heads of the victims in the fire-pan, he thereby unites those rumps with those heads.
5	2	4	He puts them in the fore-part, so as to look towards the back (west). For when, on that (former) occasion, Pragâpati wanted to slaughter these animals, they, being about to be slaughtered, wanted to run away. He seized them by (the organs of) the vital airs ; and having seized them by the vital airs, he took them into himself from the front (mouth) towards the back (inside).
5	2	5	Now the same thing which the gods did is done here. The animals do not, indeed, want to run away from him; but when he does this, it is because he wants to do what the gods did: having thus seized them by (the outlets of) the vital airs, he takes them into himself from the front towards the back.
5	2	6	And, again, why he puts the heads of the victims thereon. Pragâpati alone was here at first . He desired, 'May I create food, may I be reproduced!' He fashioned animals from his vital airs, a man from his soul (mind), a horse from his eye, a cow from his breath, a sheep from his ear, and a goat from his voice; and inasmuch as he created them from the vital airs, people say that 'Animals are vital airs.' The soul is the first of the vital airs; and inasmuch as he fashioned man from his soul, they say that 'Man is the first, and strongest of animals.' The soul is all the vital airs, for in the soul all the vital airs are established. And inasmuch as he fashioned man from his soul, they say that 'Man is all animals,' for they all belong to man.
5	2	7	Having created that food, he took it into himself from the front towards the back; and hence whosoever prepares for himself food, takes it into himself from the front towards the back (inside). That (animal food being put) in the fire-pan, and the fire-pan being the belly, he thus puts the food into the belly.
5	2	8	He now (in the first place ) thrusts gold chips into each of them,--gold is vital air, and the vital airs go out of these animals when slaughtered: thus, when he thrusts gold chips into each of them, he puts the vital airs into them.
5	2	9	Seven (chips) he thrusts into each,--seven vital airs there are in the head: these he thereby puts into it. And if there are five victims, let him thrust in five times seven (chips); for those five victims he puts on (the fire-pan), and there are seven vitalairs in each victim: he thus puts the vital airs into all of them.
5	2	10	Now, even if there is only one victim , some people thrust five times seven (into that one head), thinking, 'Those five victims he puts down (symbolically), and there are seven vital airs in each victim: thus we put the vital airs into all of them.' Let him not do so, for in this animal the form of all animals is contained ; and when he thrusts (seven chips) into this one, he thereby puts the vital airs into all of them.
5	2	11	The first (chip) he thrusts into the mouth, with , 'Fitly flow the draughts of milk like rivers,'--draughts of milk are food, and that indeed flows fitly into this mouth;--'purified within by the heart, by the mind,'--for the food is indeed purified by the heart and mind within him who is righteous;--'the streams of ghee I behold,' he thereby means the libations he is about to offer on that fire;--'the golden reed (is) in the middle of Agni,' he thereby means that gold man.
5	2	12	With , 'For praise thee!' (he thrusts one in) here (into the right nostril); praise (or splendour) means breath, for with breath one praises;--with, 'For sheen thee!' here (into the left nostril); sheen means breath, for by breath one shines; and also because everything here shines for breath;--with, 'For brightness thee!' here (into the right eye);--with, 'For lustre thee!' here (into the left eye), for bright and lustrous these two eyes indeed are;--with, 'This hath become the fiery spirit of all the world, and of Agni Vaisvânara,' here (into the right ear);--with , 'Agni, bright with brightness, the golden disk, lustrous with lustre,' here (into the left ear),--thus with two (formulas) containing 'all '; for the ear is all.
5	2	13	He then lifts up the human head--he thereby exalts it--with, 'Giver of a thousand thou art: for a thousand thee!' a thousand means everything: thus, 'the giver of everything, for everything (I bestow) thee!'
5	2	14	He then puts them (the heads) in (the fire-pan), first (that of) the man--having taken possession of the man by strength he sets him up;--the man in the middle; on both sides the other victims: he thus sets the man, as the eater, in the midst of cattle; whence man is the eater in the midst of cattle.
5	2	15	The horse and ram on the left (north) side: he thereby puts those two (kinds of) cattle in that region; whence those two (kinds of) cattle are most plentiful in that region.
5	2	16	The bull and he-goat on the right (south) side: he thereby puts those two (kinds of) cattle in that region; whence those two (kinds of) cattle are most plentiful in that region.
5	2	17	The (head of the) man he places on the milk ,--milk means cattle: he thus establishes the Sacrificer among cattle,--with , 'Withmilk anoint thou Âditya, the unborn child!' that unborn child, the man, is indeed the sun: thus, Him anoint thou with milk!--'the all-shaped maker of a thousand,' the maker  of a thousand is man; for to him belong a thousand;--'spare him with thy heat, harbour not evil thoughts against him!' that is, spare him with thy fire, do not hurt him!--'make him live a hundred years, while thou art built!' he thereby makes man the one among animals (capable of) living a hundred years; whence man, among animals, lives up to- a hundred years.
5	2	18	Then on the left side (he puts the head of) the horse, with , 'The speed of the wind,'--this one, the horse, is indeed the speed of the wind;--'Varuna's navel'--for the horse is Varuna;--'the horse, born in the midst of the flood;' the flood is the water, and the horse is indeed the water-born;--'the tawny, rock-founded child of rivers;' rock means mountain, and the waters are indeed founded on the mountains;--'harm him not, Agni, in the highest region!' the highest region means these worlds: thus, do not harm him in these worlds!
5	2	19	Then on the right side (the head of) the bull, with , 'The imperishable, red drop,' the drop doubtless is Soma; and that bull is the same as the imperishable Soma;--'the eager one (bhuranyu),' that is, the bearer (bhartri);--'Agni, the forward-striving, I glorify with homages;' forthe bull is sacred to Agni; and 'the forward-striving,' he says, because forward (towards the east) they hold up Agni , and towards the front  they attend upon him;--'duly fitting thyself by limbs,' when he is built up, then he does indeed duly fit himself limb by limb;--'harm not the inexhaustible, wide-ruling cow ,' the cow is indeed wide-ruling (virâg), and the wide-ruling is food, and accordingly the cow is food.
5	2	20	Then on the left side (he puts the head of) the ram, with , 'The defender of Tvashtri, the navel of Varuna,' for the ewe is sacred both to Varuna and to Tvashtri;--'the ewe born from the highest sphere;' the highest sphere doubtless is the ear, and the ear is the regions,--(thus ) the highest sphere is the regions;--'the mighty, thousandfold artifice of the Âsura,' that is, the great, thousandfold artifice of the Âsura ;--'O Agni, harm it not in the highestregion!' the highest region are these worlds: thus, do not harm him (the ram) in these worlds!
5	2	21	Then on the right side (he puts the head of) the he-goat, with , 'The Agni who was born from Agni,' for that Agni was indeed born from Agni ;--'from the pain of the earth or also of the sky;' for what was born from the pain (or heat) of Pragâpati, that was born from the pain of the sky and the earth;--'whereby Visvakarman begat living beings,'--the he-goat (or, the unborn one) is Vâk (Speech) , and from Vâk Visvakarman  begat living beings;--'him, O Agni, may thy wrath spare!' as the text, so the meaning.
5	2	22	These are the victims; separately he puts them down, separately he 'settles' them, and separately he pronounces the Sûdadohas on them; for separate from one another are those animals.
5	2	23	He then offers on the human head,--sacrifice is offering: he thus makes man the one among animals fit to sacrifice; whence man alone among animals performs sacrifice.
5	2	24	And, again, why he offers thereon:--he thereby lays vigour into the head. He offers with ghee,--ghee is a thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt means vigour: he thus lays vigour into it. With 'Hail' (he offers),--the 'Hail' (svâhâkâra, m.) is a male, and the male means vigour: he thus lays vigour into it. With a trishtubh verse (he offers);the Trishtubh is a thunderbolt, and the thunderboltmeans vigour; the Trishtubh is vigour: with vigour he thus lays vigour into it.
5	2	25	Having run through  the (first) half-verse, he pronounces the Svâhâ;--the rik (verse) is a bone: having cleft asunder that skull-bone which is here inside the head, he there lays vigour into it.
5	2	26	Having then run through the (second) half-verse, he pronounces the Svâhâ,--having joined together that skull-bone which is here on the top of the head, he there lays vigour into it.
5	2	27	'The brilliant front of the gods hath risen,' for that man is yonder sun, and he indeed rises as the brilliant front (face) of the gods;--'the eye of Mitra, Varuna, and Agni,' for that (sun) is the eye of both gods and men;--'he hath filled heaven, and earth, and the air,' for when he rises he indeed fills these worlds;--'Sûrya, the soul of the movable and immovable;' for that (sun) is indeed the soul of everything here that moves and stands.
5	2	28	He then stands by (the heads, revering them) with the Utsargas . For at that time when Pragâpati wanted to slaughter the victims, they, being about to be slaughtered, were distressed (or pained); and by these Utsargas he drove out their distress , their evil. In like manner does this one, by these Utsargas, now drive out their distress, their evil.
5	2	29	Now some remove the distress of whichever (head of a) victim they put down, thinking lest they might put distress, evil, thereon; but it is they thatput distress, evil, thereon; for the distress they remove from the preceding one, they put on (the altar) with the succeeding one.
5	2	30	And some revere (the heads) whilst moving round them, thinking, 'we remove distress upwards;' but these indeed follow the distress, the evil, upwards; for upwards he (the Sacrificer) goes by this performance , and upwards they remove the distress.
5	2	31	Let him remove it outside the fire (-altar); that fire (-altar) being these worlds, he thus puts distress outside these worlds;--outside the Vedi; the Vedi being this earth, he thus puts distress outside this earth; (he does so) standing with his face towards the north; for in that region those animals are, and he thus puts distress into them in the region in which they are.
5	2	32	He first removes that of the man--for him he puts down first--with , 'Harm not this two-footed animal!' the two-footed animal doubtless is the same as man: thus, 'do not harm that one!'--'(thou) the thousand-eyed, being built for pith;'--the thousand-eyed he (Agni) is on account of the chips of gold; 'for pith,' that is, 'for food.'--'Graciously accept thou, O Agni, the sham-man, the victim, as pith!' a sham-man is a kim-purusha (mock-man) : thus, 'accept graciously the kim-purusha, O Agni!'--'Building up therewith thy forms, get thee settled!' the form is the self: thus, 'Building uptherewith, perfect thyself !'--'Let thy burning heat reach the sham-man! let thy burning heat reach him whom we hate!' he thereby lays burning heat into the sham-man, and into him whom he hates.
5	2	33	Then that of the horse, with , 'Harm not this one-hoofed animal!' the one-hoofed animal doubtless is the same as the horse: thus, do not harm that one!--'the racer neighing among the racers;' for neighing indeed he is, and a racer among racers;--'The wild fallow (beast) do I assign unto thee,' he thereby assigns to him the wild fallow (beast) ;--'building up therewith thy forms, get thee settled!' that is, 'building up therewith, perfect thyself!'--'Let thy burning heat reach the fallow beast! let thy burning heat reach him whom we hate!' he thereby lays burning heat into the fallow beast, and into him whom he hates.
5	2	34	Then that of the bull, with , 'This thousandfold, hundred-streamed well--,' for a thousandfold, hundred-streamed well he, the bull (cow), indeed is;--'extended in the middle of the flood,' the flood doubtless are these worlds: thus, subsisted upon in these worlds;--'the inexhaustible, milking ghee for man,'--for ghee this inexhaustible (cow) indeed milks for man-- 'harm not, O Agni, in the highest region!' the highest region doubtless are these worlds: thus, do not harm it in these worlds!--'The wild buffalo do I assign unto thee,' he thereby assigns to him the wild buffalo (gavaya);--'building up therewith thy forms, get thee settled!' that is, 'building up therewith, perfect thyself!'--'Let thy burning heat reach the buffalo! let thy burning heat reach him whom we hate!' he thereby lays burning heat into the buffalo, and into him whom he hates.
5	2	35	Then that of the sheep, with , This woollen--,' that is, 'this woolly,'--'navel of Varuna,' for the sheep is sacred to Varuna;--'the skin of animals, two-footed and four-footed,' for that (sheep) indeed is the skin of both kinds of animals , two-footed and four-footed;--'the first birth-place of Tvashtri's creatures,' for Tvashtri indeed fashioned this as the first form;--'harm not, O Agni, in the highest region!' the highest region is these worlds: thus, 'do not harm him in these worlds!'--'The wild buffalo do I assign unto thee,' he thereby assigns the wild buffalo (ushtra) to him;--'building up therewith thy forms, get thee settled!' that is, 'building up therewith, perfect thyself!'--'Let thy burning heat reach the buffalo! let thy burning heat reach him whom we hate!' he thereby lays burning heat into the buffalo, and into him whom he hates.
5	2	36	Then that of the he-goat, with , 'Verily, the he-goat was produced from Agni's heat;'--that which was produced from Pragâpati's heat, was indeed produced from Agni's heat;--'he saw the progenitor at first,' the progenitor doubtless is Pragâpati: thus, 'he saw Pragâpati at first;'--'thereby the gods at first (agre) went to the godhead;' the he-goat  doubtless is speech; and from speech the gods doubtless first went to the godhead, to the summit (agram);--'thereby they went to the height, the wise;' the height doubtless is the heavenly world: thus, 'thereby they went to the heavenly world, the wise;'--'The wild sarabha do I assign unto thee,'--he thereby assigns the wild sarabha  to him;--'building up therewith thy forms, get thee settled!' that is, 'building up therewith, perfect thyself!'--'Let thy burning heat reach the sarabha! let thy burning heat reach him whom we hate!' he thereby lays burning heat into the sarabha, and into him whom he hates.
5	2	37	As to this they say,--The pain (heat), the evil of these animals, which Pragâpati drove out, became these five animals; they, with their pith (sacrificial essence) gone out of them, are pithless, unfit for sacrifice; a Brâhmana should not eat of them: he consigns them to that region; whence Parganya does not rain in that region where these are.
5	2	38	He returns (to the offering-fire) and stands thereby worshipping it;--for when he goes outside the Vedi, whilst Agni (the fire-altar) is only half built up, he does what is improper; he now makes amends to him to prevent his doing injury. Witha verse to Agni (he worships): it is to Agni he thereby makes amends;--with an undefined one; the undefined means everything: by means of everything he thus makes amends to him;--with (a verse) containing the word 'youngest:' this indeed, to wit, the youngest, is his favourite form.;--inasmuch as when born he took possession (yu) of everything here, he is the youngest (yavishtha).
5	2	39	'Shield thou, O youngest, the men of the liberal worshipper!' the liberal worshipper is the Sacrificer, and the men are the people;--'hear thou the songs!' that is, hear this hymn of praise!--'protect thou kin and self!' the kin (race) means offspring: thus, 'protect both (the Sacrificer's) offspring and himself.'
5	2	40	Having stepped on the altar and walked round behind the naturally-perforated (brick), he lays down the Apasyâh (water-bricks);--now the Apasyâh are the same as water, and the water has gone out of these victims: he thus puts water into these victims, when he lays down the Apasyâh (bricks). He lays them down close to the (heads of the) animals: he thereby puts the water together with the animals. He lays down five (bricks) in each quarter, for five are those victims. He lays them down in every (quarter): everywhere he thus puts water into them.
5	2	41	Now the first fifteen are the Apasyâh,--water is a thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt is fifteenfold;--hence wherever the waters flow, there they destroy evil; and verily the thunderbolt destroys the evil of this place: hence, when it rains one should go about uncovered, thinking, 'May that thunderbolt remove evil from me!'
5	2	42	And the last five are the Khandasyâh (the metres’ bricks);--the metres are cattle, and cattle is food; or rather the flesh of cattle is food, and the flesh has departed from these victims: he therefore puts flesh on those cattle when he lays down the Khandasyâh. He places them close to the victims: he thereby puts the flesh close to the (bones of the) cattle. The Apasyâh are inside, the Khandasyâh outside; for the water is inside, and the flesh outside.
5	2	43	As to this they say, 'If there are that water and that flesh, where then is the skin, and where the hair?' Well, the skin of cattle is food, and the hair of cattle is food; and when he lays down the Khandasyâh, that is the skin of the victims, that is their hair. Or, again, those goats’ hair which are in the fire-pan , they are hair. The fire-pan is outside, and the victims’ heads are inside, for outside is the hair, and inside is the body. 'Whether in the one way, or whether in the other,' so Sândilya was wont to say, 'in any case we make up the victims wholly and completely.'
5	2	44	And, again, why he lays down the Apasyâh. When Pragâpati was disjointed the water went from him; that being gone, he sank down; and because he sank down (vis), therefore there are twenty (vimsati, viz. such bricks). It flowed from his fingers,--the fingers being the end, it (the water) went from him in the end.
5	2	45	Now the Pragâpati who became disjointed is this very Agni who is now being built up; and the water (âpah) which went from him is these very Apasyâh;--hence when he lays them down, he thereby puts back into him that very water which went from him: therefore he now lays these down.
5	2	46	'In the way of the waters I settle thee!' the way of the waters is the wind; for when he blows hither and thither then the waters flow: in the wind he 'settles' this (first brick).
5	2	47	'In the swell of the waters I settle thee!' the swell of the waters is the plants, for wherever the waters keep swelling there plants grow: in the plants he settles this (brick).
5	2	48	'In the ashes of the waters I settle thee!' the ashes of the waters are the foam: in foam he settles this one.
5	2	49	'In the light of the waters I settle thee!' the light of the waters is the lightning: in the lightning he settles this one.
5	2	50	'In the path of the waters I settle thee!' the path of the waters is this earth, for on the earth the waters flow: on this earth he settles this one. Whatever water flowed from those (five) forms of his, that water he now (by these five formulas) puts back into him; and those forms themselves he thereby restores to him.
5	2	51	'In the flood, the seat, I settle thee!' the flood is the breath: in the breath he settles this one.
5	2	52	'In the ocean, the seat, I settle thee!' the sea is the mind; from the mind-ocean, with speech for a shovel, the gods dug out the triple science. Thereto this verse applies,--'May the true god know this day where the gods placed that offering, they who dug it out from the ocean withsharp shovels;'--the ocean is the mind, the sharp shovel is speech, the offering is the triple science: it is thereto this verse applies. In the mind he settles this (brick).
5	2	53	'In the stream, the seat, I settle thee!' the stream is speech: in speech he settles this one.
5	2	54	'In the abode of the waters I settle thee!' the abode of the waters is the eye, for there water always abides: in the eye he settles this one.
5	2	55	'In the goal of the waters I settle thee!' the goal of the waters is the ear: in the ear he settles this one. Whatever water flowed from those (five) forms of his, that water he now (by these five formulas) puts back into him; and those forms themselves he thereby restores to him.
5	2	56	'In the seat of the waters I settle thee!' the seat of the waters is the sky, for in the sky the waters are seated: in the sky he settles this one.
5	2	57	'In the home of the waters I settle thee!' the home of the waters is the air: in the air he settles this one.
5	2	58	'In the womb of the waters I settle thee!' the womb of the waters is the sea: in the sea he settles this one.
5	2	59	'In the sediment of the waters I settle thee!' the sediment (purîsha) of the waters is sand: in the sand he settles this one.
5	2	60	'In the resort of the waters I settle thee!' the resort of the waters is food: in food he settles this one. Whatever water flowed from those (five) forms of his, that water he now (by these five formulas) puts back into him; and those forms themselves he thereby restores to him.
5	2	61	'By the Gâyatrî metre I settle thee!-- By the Trishtubh metre I settle thee!--By the Gagatî metre I settle thee!--By the Anushtubh metre I settle thee!--By the Paṅkti metre I settle thee!' Whatever water flowed from those metres of his, that he now (by these formulas) puts back into him; and those metres themselves he thereby restores to him.
5	2	62	These (bricks) are fingers (and toes): he puts them on all sides , for these fingers (and toes) are on all sides; he puts them at the ends, for these fingers (and toes) are at the ends; in four sets he puts them on, for these fingers (and toes) are in four sets; five he puts on each time, for there are five fingers (or toes) at each (limb); separately he puts them on, for separate are these fingers (and toes); only once he 'settles' each (set): he thereby makes (each set) one and the same, whence they have a common connecting-link.
