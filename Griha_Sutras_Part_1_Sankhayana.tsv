1	1	1	. Now henceforth we shall declare the Pâkayagñas.
1	1	2	. When (a pupil) is going to return (from his teacher), let him keep that fire (as his domestic fire) on which he has put the last piece of wood (as required by the regulations for a student),
1	1	3	Or (he should keep) his nuptial fire.
1	1	4	Some declare (that the domestic fire should be kindled) at the time of the division of the inheritance.
1	1	5	. Or that after the death of the householder the eldest one himself (should kindle it).
1	1	6	(It should be kindled) on the day of the new moon of the month of Vaisâkha or on another (new moon day).
1	1	7	Some say (that the fire should be kindled) according to the (sacrificer's) wishes under the (corresponding) constellation.
1	1	8	. He should light his fire at one of the following places, viz. in the house of a Vaisya who is rich incattle, at a frying-pan, or (at the fire of) one who offers many sacrifices.
1	1	9	. Some say that (the fire should be fetched from one of the above-mentioned places) in the evening and in the morning.
1	1	10	The inauguration (of the fire) by an evening offering should be learnt from the Adhvaryus, according to (my) teacher.
1	1	11	In the morning he shall offer a full oblation with a verse sacred to Vishnu, or silently.
1	1	12	. The time for setting it (i.e. the domestic fire) in a blaze and for sacrificing on it has been explained by (the rules given with regard to) the Agnihotra.
1	1	13	. And 'invested with the sacrificial cord,' &c., all these rules, as far as they are applicable, should be applied (here also) in consequence of the unity of the ritual.
1	1	14	With regard to this they quote also (the following Sloka):
1	1	15	. 'The kinds of Pâkayagñas, the kinds of Haviryagñas, and again the kinds of Soma sacrifices,'Twenty-one by number, these are proclaimed to be the kinds of sacrifice.'
1	2	1	At the end of the sacrificial acts (follows) the distribution of food to Brâhmanas.
1	2	2	Voice, (pleasantness of) form, age, learning, moral character, (right) conduct are the qualities (required in the Brâhmanas who are to be invited thereto).
1	2	3	Learning, however, outweighs every (other qualification).
1	2	4	A learned one should not be passed over.
1	2	5	'The threefold (knowledge, viz. that) which refers to the deities, that which refers to the Âtman, and that which refers to sacrifice,'(Handed down) in the Mantras and in the Brâhmana: this is called learning.
1	2	6	'A performer of the sacred rights, a man who has studied (the Veda), who is old in learning and devoted to austerities:'He who gives food (even) once to such (a Brâhmana), hunger will not befall that man any more.
1	2	7	'Whatsoever deity he may wish to satiate at any sacrifice,'Destining it to that (deity) in his mind, he shall give (the food) to a person like that.
1	2	8	'An oblation deposited in a person like that will never miss its way to the deity;'Treasure of men, vessel of gods (in which they receive what is given to them) he is called.'
1	3	1	. Now (follow) the ceremonies of the days of the new and full moon.He fasts.
1	3	2	. In the morning, when the sun shines on thetop of the great trees, that is the most auspicious time for all kinds of sacrifices, unless there be a special rule.
1	3	3	. With a genial mind, clean, on a pure, protected spot, having cooked a full, thin mess of rice, he offers that cooked oblation to the deities of the festivals of the new and full moon, distributing it in the due way.
1	3	4	. In the oblations of cooked food the acts of taking (the intended oblation), of putting it down (near the fire), and of sprinkling it (with water) are performed with regard to the deities of the (respective) Mantras.
1	3	5	. And the rules about the portions to be cut off (from the sacrificial food, are valid).
1	3	6	. But before the sacrifices of the new and full moon one should make offerings to the deities of the Anvârambhanîya ceremony.
1	3	7	. The time for the new moon sacrifice is not elapsed until the full moon, nor that for the full moon sacrifice until the new moon.
1	3	8	. And some say that the morning oblation may be made at the time of the evening oblation, in the case of danger.
1	3	9	But the time is fixed, as at the Agnihotra an expiation has been prescribed for him who has neglected the time.
1	3	10	At the two daily oblations one should use as sacrificial food either rice or barley or grains.
1	3	11	In case these are not at hand, other (sorts of sacrificial food are) not prohibited.
1	3	12	Some say that if he uses grains, he should wash them.
1	3	13	With the other (kinds of food) no such preparation takes place.
1	3	14	. In the evening (he makes the oblation) to Agni, in the morning to Sûrya,
1	3	15	And after both silently to Pragâpati.
1	3	16	Some (say that) before the first oblation a piece of wood (is to be put on the fire).
1	3	17	. The sprinkling with water as indicated (in the Srauta-sûtra).
1	4	1	. When he has risen in the morning and has sipped water, let him daily repeat his recital.
1	4	2	(This consists of, or is accompanied by, the following texts:) the two verses, 'To-day, god Savitar' ; the hymn, 'Go away, Manasaspati' ; the hymn, 'Right and truth' ; the verses, 'Look down, ye Âdityas,' to the end of the hymn ;the verse, 'O Indra, the best treasures' ; the verse, 'The swan dwelling in purity' ; the verse, 'Adoration to the great ones' ; the verse, 'What we fear, Indra' ; the verse, 'And of the sleep' ; the verse, 'He who says to me, O king' ; the hymn, 'Let glory be mine, Agni' ; and the five verses,' Bliss may create for us' .
1	5	1	. There are four kinds of Pâkayagñas, viz. the HUTA, the AHUTA, the PRAHUTA, and the PRÂSITA.
1	5	2	. On the following five occasions, viz. the wedding, the tonsure (of the child's head), the initiation (of the Brahmakârin), the cutting of the beard, and the parting of the hair, (on these occasions) in the outer hall—
1	5	3	. To a place that has been smeared (with cow-dung), which is elevated, and which has been sprinkled (with water), he carries forward the fire,
1	5	4	Having kindled it by rubbing, according to some teachers, at his marriage.
1	5	5	During the northern course of the sun, in thetime of the increasing moon, on an auspicious day he shall seize the hand of a girl,
1	5	6	Who should possess (the auspicious) characteristics (required),
1	5	7	Whose limbs should be proportionate,
1	5	8	Whose hair should be smooth,
1	5	9	. Who should also have at her neck two curls turned to the right.
1	5	10	(Of such a girl) he shall know that she will give birth to six men.
1	6	1	. If he will acquire a wife, let him recite over the wooers (whom he sends to the girl's father) when they go away, the verse, 'Thornless' .
1	6	2	When they arrive, they take flowers, fruits, barley, and a pot of water.
1	6	3	. They say thrice, 'Here I am, sir!'
1	6	4	When these words have been uttered, they ask the girl in marriage, reciting the clan names, the dwellers turning their faces to the east, the visitors to the west.
1	6	5	When the matter pleases both sides, let them touch a full vessel into which have been put flowers,fried grain, fruits, barley, and gold, and let them recite (the formula), 'Undisturbed art thou, the undisturbable vigour of the gods, not cursed, protecting against a curse, unexposed to a curse. Might I straightway attain to truth. Put me into prosperity.'
1	6	6	. With the verse, 'Offspring may produce us' , the Âkârya of the girl's (family), standing up, places (the vessel) on her head (saying), 'Offspring I put into thee, cattle I put into thee, splendour and holy lustre I put into thee.'
1	7	1	. When assent has been declared (by the girl's father, the bridegroom) sacrifices.
1	7	2	He besmears a quadrangular space with cow-dung.
1	7	3	. (Let him consider in the ceremonies to be performed,) of the two eastern intermediate directions, the southern one as that to which (the rites) should be directed, if the rites belong to the Manes,
  of the two eastern intermediate directions, sacred to Îsâna, should be considered as that to which the ceremonies sacred to the gods, such as oblations, &c., are to be directed.'—
1	7	4	The northern one, if the rites belong to the gods,
1	7	5	Or rather the east (itself) according to some (teachers).
1	7	6	. He draws in the middle (of the sacrificial ground) a line from south to north,
1	7	7	Upwards from this, turned upwards, to the south one line, in the middle one, to the north one.
1	7	8	These he sprinkles (with water),
1	7	9	. Carries forward the fire with the verse, 'I carry forward Agni with genial mind; may he be the assembler of goods. Do no harm to us, to the old nor to the young; be a saviour to us, to men and animals,'
1	7	10	Or (he carries it forward) silently,
1	7	11	Then he wipes with his wet hand three times around the fire, turning his right side to it. This they call SAMÛHANA (sweeping together).
1	7	12	Once, turning his left side to it, in the rites belonging to the Manes.
1	8	1	. Now (follows) the strewing (of grass) around (the fire).
1	8	2	He strews eastward-pointed Kusa grass around it, in three layers or in five layers,
1	8	3	Beginning on the east side, then to the west, then to the west.
1	8	4	He covers the roots (of the grass-blades) with the points.
1	8	5	And all kinds of rites are to be performed beginning south, ending north.
1	8	6	. He places the Brahman south with the words, BHÛR BHUVAH SVAH,
1	8	7	Adorns him with flowers,
1	8	8	. Carries forward on the north side the Pranîtâ waters with the words, 'Who carries ye forward?'—
1	8	9	. Takes up with the left hand the Kusa blades, and arranges them (on the ground) with the right hand,
1	8	10	Bending his right knee,
1	8	11	The left when worshipping the Manes.
1	8	12	The strewing around (of the grass) is not necessary in the Âgya offerings,
1	8	13	. Nor in the standing offerings, according to Mândûkeya.
1	8	14	. He now measures off with the span (of his hand) two Kusa blades, which are not unequal, with unbroken points, bearing no young shoots in them, and severs them (from their roots) with a Kusa blade, saying, 'Purifiers are ye.'
1	8	15	There are two or three (of these Kusa strainers).
1	8	16	He holds them with their points to the east and sprinkles them (with water, saying), 'Belonging to Vishnu.'
1	8	17	With the two Kusa blades he sprinkles (water) around the fire three times, keeping his right side turned towards it,
1	8	18	. Takes up the Âgya pot with the words, 'Milk of the cows art thou;'
1	8	19	. Puts it on the fire with the words, 'For sap thee;'
1	8	20	. Takes it from the fire towards the north with the words, 'For juice thee;'
1	8	21	. And holding the two (Kusa) strainers with their points to the north, seizing them on both sideswith his two thumbs and fourth fingers, he bends them down, the points upwards, and dips them into the Âgya with the words,'By the impulse of Savitar I purify thee with this uninjured purifier, with the rays of the good sun.'
1	8	22	(This) preparation of the Âgya (takes place) each time.
1	8	23	Let him not offer (Âgya) which has not been (thus) prepared.
1	8	24	. Also the waters in the Sruva spoon (he purifies) with the words, '(By the impulse) of Savitar (I purify) you.'
1	8	25	This (is called) the PRANÎTÂ and the PROKSHANÎ water.
1	9	1	. The Sruva spoon (serves as) a vessel.
1	9	2	According to the purpose the properties (of the different things to be used at each oblation) should be chosen.
1	9	3	. Taking up Kusa blades with the left, and the[paragraph continues] Sruva at its bottom with the right hand, with the words, 'The hand of Vishnu art thou'—
1	9	4	. He offers with the Sruva the Âgya oblations.
1	9	5	. Beginning from the north-west side of the fire he offers (the Âgya) unintermittingly on the south side (of the fire) with (the verse), 'Thou Agni art full of foresight' .
1	9	6	Beginning from the south-west side of the fire he unintermittingly offers on the north side with (the verse), 'To whom these snowy mountains' .
1	9	7	To Agni belongs the northern Âgya portion, to Soma the southern.
1	9	8	. In the middle (are made) the other oblations,
1	9	9	(With the words,) 'Agni is the begetter; may he give to me N.N. as my wife; svâhâ!'Soma is rich in wives; may he make me rich in wives by N.N.; svâhâ!'Pûshan is rich in kindred; may he make me rich in kindred by the father, the mother, the brothers of N.N.; svâhâ!'
1	9	10	. At the Âgya oblations the offering of the two Âgya portions and of the Svishtakrit oblation is not standing,
1	9	11	. Nor in the standing oblations, according to Mândûkeya.
1	9	12	. The place for the insertion is the interval between the Mahâvyâhritis, the general expiation, and the oblation to Pragâpati.
1	9	13	If the oblation consists in Âgya, let him seize the Kusa blades in his left hand with his right hand at their points and with the left at their roots, and let him wet their points (with Âgya) in the Sruva, the middle and the roots in the Âgya pot;
1	9	14	In the oblations of cooked food, however, the points in the Sruk, the middle in the Sruva, the roots in the Âgya pot.
1	9	15	When he then has thrown them (into the fire) with the words, 'Agni's garment art thou,'
1	9	16	And has put on (the fire) three pieces of wood,
1	9	17	. (Water) is sprinkled round (the fire) as stated above.
1	9	18	Oblations for which only the deities are indicated, but no texts prescribed, are to be made merely with the word SVÂHÂ, 'To such and such a deity svâhâ! To such and such a deity svâhâ!'
1	9	19	. The ritual (here) declared of the sacrifice (tobe performed) when (the father's) assent (to give away his daughter) has been declared—
1	10	1	. Forms the standard for all sacrifices that procure happiness,
1	10	2	And for all Âgya offerings,
1	10	3	. For the sacrifice of animals which are tied to a branch,
1	10	4	. And for the offerings of boiled (rice) grains and of cooked food.
1	10	5	. These are performed, all the offerings of cooked food, without PRAYÂGA and ANUYÂGA oblations, without (the invocation of) the ILÂ, without NIGADA recitation, and without SÂMIDHENÎ verses.
1	10	6	There are also the following Slokas:
1	10	7	. '(An oblation is called) HUTA, (if made) by the performing of the Agnihotra; AHUTA (i.e. unsacrificed, if) by the Bali offering; PRAHUTA (i.e. sacrificed up, if) by a sacrifice to the Manes; PRÂSITA (i.e. tasted, if) deposited as an offering in a Brâhmana.
1	10	8	. 'Without raising his knees, with spread knees let him always offer his oblation; for the gods never accept an offering (that has been made holding the hand) not between (the knees).
1	10	9	. 'But when he has repeated a text sacred to Rudra, to the Rakshas, to the Manes, to the Asuras, or that contains an imprecation, let him touch water, and so also when he has touched his own body.'
1	11	1	. Now when the bride is to be carried away (to the bridegroom's house) that night, or on the next, or on the third night,
1	11	2	. On that night, when (the darkness of) night is gone, they wash the girl up to her head with (water that has been made fragrant by) all sorts of herbs and the choicest fruits together with scents;
1	11	3	They put on her a newly-dyed garment or (a new one) which has not yet been washed;
1	11	4	. Then (the Âkârya of the bride's family) makes the girl sit down behind the fire, and while she takes hold of him he sacrifices with the Mahâvyâhritis, and then he makes Âgya oblations to Agni, to Soma, to Pragâpati, to Mitra, to Varuna, to Indra, to Indrânî, to the Gandharva, to Bhaga, to Pûshan, to Tvashtar, to Brihaspati, to the king Pratyânîka.
1	11	5	After they have regaled four or eight women, who are not widows, with lumps of vegetables, Surâ, and food, these should perform a dance four times.
1	11	6	The same deities (they worship also) on behalf of the man,
1	11	7	And Vaisravana and Îsâna.
1	11	8	Then follows the distribution of food to Brâhmanas.
1	12	1	The bridegroom, who has bathed and for whom auspicious ceremonies have been performed, is escorted by happy young women, who are not widows, to the girl's house.
1	12	2	To these he shall not behave unobsequiously, except where forbidden food or a transgression is concerned.
1	12	3	Having obtained their permission, he then gives her the garment with (the verse), 'The Raibhî was' .
1	12	4	With (the verse), 'Mind was the cushion'  he takes up the salve-box.
1	12	5	. The verse for the Anointing is, 'May the Visve devâs anoint (or, unite),'
1	12	6	. 'As this (has protected) Sakî the beloved one, and Aditi the mother of noble sons, and Apâlâ who was free from widowhood, nay it thus here protect thee, N.N.!'—with these words (the. bridegroom) gives her into her right hand the quill of a porcupine (and) a string of three twisted threads,
1	12	7	With the verse, 'Shape by shape'  a mirror into the left.
1	12	8	Her relations tie (to her body) a red and black, woollen or linen cord with three (amulet) gems, with the verse, 'Dark-blue and red' .
1	12	9	With the verse, 'Full of honey the herbs' , (the bridegroom) ties (to her body) Madhûka flowers.
1	12	10	. At the wedding one cow, when the Argha ceremony has been performed; in the house one cow: these are the two Madhuparka cows.
1	12	11	. (The bridegroom) makes the girl sit down behind the fire, and while she takes hold of him he makes three oblations with the Mahâvyâhritis.
1	12	12	A fourth (oblation) with (the three Mahâvyâhritis) together is to be understood from this rule.
1	12	13	In this way, where no express rule is stated, in all sacrifices that procure happiness, one is to sacrifice before and afterwards with these same (Mahâvyâhritis).
1	13	1	'Be queen with thy father-in-law,' with this verse  her father or brother sacrifices with a sword's point on her head, or with the Sruva, standing while she is sitting, with his face turned to the west, while her face is turned to the east.
1	13	2	'I seize thy hand for the sake of happiness' , with these words (the bridegroom) seizes with his right hand her right hand with the thumb, both hands being turned with the palms upwards, he standing while she is sitting, with his face turned to the west, while her face is turned to the east.
1	13	3	And when he has murmured the following five verses,
1	13	4	. (He continues thus,) 'This am I, that art thou;that art thou, this am I; the heaven I, the earth thou; the Rik art thou, the Sâman I. So be thou devoted to me.'Well! Let us here marry. Let us beget offspring. Let us acquire many sons who may reach old age.'
1	13	5	(The Âkârya) fills, with the words bhûr bhuvah svah, a new water-pot,
1	13	6	. Throws into it (branches) with milky sap and leaves, of a tree the name of which is masculine, together with Kusa grass,
1	13	7	And gold, according to some (teachers),
1	13	8	And hands it over to a student who observes silence.
1	13	9	. They should walk round this Stheyâ water, (placed) to the north-east, so that they turn their right sides . towards it.
1	13	10	And after (the Âkârya) has placed a stone towards the northern direction,
1	13	11	(The bridegroom) makes her rise with the words, 'Come, thou joyful one,'
1	13	12	And makes her tread with the tip of her right foot on the stone, with the words, 'Come, tread on the stone; like a stone be firm. Tread the foes down; overcome the enemies.'
1	13	13	He then leads her round the fire so that their right sides are turned to it,
1	13	14	And gives her a second garment with the same text .
1	13	15	Her father or brother pours out of a basket fried grain mixed with Samî leaves into her joined hands.
1	13	16	The spreading under, the sprinkling over, and the second sprinkling over (are done) with Âgya.
1	13	17	. She sacrifices those (fried grains).
1	14	1	'This woman, strewing grains, prays thus, "May I bring bliss to my relations; may my husband live long. Svâhâ!"'—while the husband murmurs (this) text, she sacrifices standing.
1	14	2	. (All the ceremonies,) beginning from the treadingupon the stone, (are repeated) in the same way for a second time,
1	14	3	And in the same way a third time.
1	14	4	Silently, if they like, a fourth time.
1	14	5	. (The Âkârya?) makes (them) step forward in a north-eastern direction seven steps (with the words),
1	14	6	'For sap with one step, for juice with two steps, for the prospering of wealth with three steps, for comfort with four steps, for cattle with five steps, for the seasons with six steps. Friend be with seven steps.'
1	14	7	(The Âkârya?) 'appeases' those (foot-steps) with water.
1	14	8	. With the three Âpohishthîyâ verses  he wipes (them) with the Stheyâ water,
1	14	9	. And sprinkles it on their heads.
1	14	10	(The bridegroom then) says, 'I give you a cow.'
1	14	11	Let him give something to the Brâhmanas each time at the Sthâlîpâkas and other rites;
1	14	12	. To him who knows the Sûryâ hymn the bride's shift.
1	14	13	. A cow is the optional gift to be given by a Brâhmana,
1	14	14	A village by a Râganya,
1	14	15	A horse by a Vaisya.
1	14	16	. A hundred (cows) with a chariot (he gives to a father) who has only daughters.
1	14	17	To those versed in the sacrificial rites he gives a horse.
1	15	1	The three verses, 'I loosen thee' , when she departs from the house.
1	15	2	'The living one they bewail' , if she begins to cry.
1	15	3	. The wife then smears the axle of the chariot with clarified butter with this (verse), 'They feasted, they got drunk' ,
1	15	4	And with the two (verses), 'Pure are thy wheels,' 'Thy two wheels' , of the two wheels the first with the first (verse) and the second with the second (verse),
1	15	5	And the two bulls.
1	15	6	. After (the wife?) has put, with this (verse), 'In the box of the wheel' , a branch of a fruit-bearing tree into each of the holes destined for the pins,
1	15	7	Or, if (such branches) are (already) fixed, has recited (that verse) over them,
1	15	8	They then harness the two bulls with the two (verses), 'Harnessed be thy right one' , (the bridegroom) reciting the half-verse, 'White the two bulls' , over them when they have been harnessed.
1	15	9	Now should any part of the chariot break or burst, let him take the girl to the house of one who keeps the sacred fires,
1	15	10	And repair (the damage) with the verse, 'Cover thyself with the Khadiras' .
1	15	11	A knot with the verse, 'Him like a horse' .
1	15	12	He then murmurs the five verses, 'May prosperity give us' .
1	15	13	'Adorned with Kimsuka flowers' , when she mounts the chariot;
1	15	14	'May no waylayers meet us' , at a cross-way;
1	15	15	'Which the woman’s' , near a cemetery;
1	15	16	The half-verse, 'O tree with thy hundredbranches' , he mutters near a big tree;
1	15	17	'The good protectress' , when she ascends a ship;
1	15	18	'Carrying stones' , when she crosses a river;
1	15	19	Optionally (he) also (murmurs the same verse, if that is done) with the harnessed chariot;
1	15	20	'Up may your wave' , at deep places (in the river);
1	15	21	And (at such places) let her not look out.
1	15	22	The seven verses, 'Here may delight' , when she has reached the house, omitting the verses already employed.
1	16	1	. 'A bull's hide'—this has been declared.
1	16	2	. On that hide the husband makes her sit down and sacrifices, while she takes hold of him, four oblations (with the following formulas),
1	16	3	'With god Agni, with the earth-world of the worlds, and the Rig-veda of the Vedas: therewith I appease thee, N.N., svâhâ!'With god Vâyu, with the air-world of the worlds,with the Yagur-veda of the Vedas: therewith I appease thee, N.N., svâhâ!'With god Sûrya, with the heaven-world of the worlds, with the Sâma-veda of the Vedas: therewith I appease thee, N.N., svâhâ!'With god Kandra, with the world of the quarters (of the horizon) of the worlds, with the Brahma-veda of the Vedas: therewith I appease thee, N.N., svâhâ!'
1	16	4	Or, 'Bhûh! What harm dwells in thee, bringing death to thy husband, death to thy husband's brother, that I make death-bringing to thy paramour, N.N., svâhâ!'—thus the first (of the before-mentioned formulas) may be joined with the first Mahâvyâhriti, the second with the second, the third with the third, the fourth with (the three Mahâvyâhritis) together.
1	16	5	With (the verse), 'With no evil eye' , let him besmear (her) eyes with Âgya salve.
1	16	6	(The bridegroom,) having touched the ends of her hair with the three (verses), 'How may us the resplendent one . . .' ,
1	16	7	And having quickly recited the four verses, 'And those divine medicines' , at the end (of that text) with the word svâhâ (pours out) the remainder on (her) head.
1	16	8	. Here some place a boy of good birth on both sides, in her lap, with this (verse), 'Into thy womb' ,
1	16	9	Or also silently.
1	16	10	Into this (boy's) joined hands (the bridegroom) gives fruits and causes (the Brâhmanas) to wish an auspicious day.
1	16	11	Thus she becomes the mother of male children.
1	16	12	With the rest of the hymn, 'Stay ye here both' , they make them enter the house.
1	17	1	With the verse, 'I praised Dadhikrâvan' , let them drink together curds.
1	17	2	. Let them sit silent, when the sun has set, until the polar-star appears.
1	17	3	He shows her the polar-star with the words, 'Firm be thou, thriving with me!'
1	17	4	Let her say, 'I see the polar-star; may I obtain offspring.'

2	1	10	Let them not initiate such men,
2	1	11	Nor teach them,
2	1	12	Nor perform sacrifices for them,

2	1	25	Whatsoever (the student) wears at his initiation, is at the disposal of the teacher.
2	1	26	. Having had him shaved all round (his head) he should initiate him.
2	1	27	After (the student) has washed and adorned himself,
2	1	28	. (And) after (the teacher) has sacrificed, both station themselves behind the fire, the teacher with his face turned to the east, the other with his face to the west.
2	1	29	Let him initiate him standing while (the other also) stands.
2	1	30	. ['The firm, powerful eye of Mitra, glorious splendour, strong and prosperous, a chaste, flowing vesture, this skin I put on, a valiant (man).']
2	2	1	'Here has come to us, protecting (us) from evil words, purifying our kin as a purifier, clothing herself, by (the power of) inhalation and exhalation, with strength, this friendly goddess, this blessed girdle'—with these words, three times repeated, he ties the girdle from left to right thrice round.
2	2	2	. (There should be) one knot, or also three, or also five.
2	2	3	. He adjusts the sacrificial cord with (the words), 'The sacrificial cord art thou. With the cord of the sacrifice I invest thee.'
2	2	4	. He fills the two hollows of (his own and the student's) joined hands (with water), and then says to him: 'What is thy name?'
2	2	5	'I am N.N., sir,' says the other.
2	2	6	. 'Descending from the same Rishis?' says the teacher.
2	2	7	'Descending from the same Rishis, sir,' says the other.
2	2	8	'Declare (that thou art) a student, sir.'
2	2	9	'I am a student, sir,' says the other.
2	2	10	With the words, 'Bhûr bhuvah svah' (the teacher) sprinkles thrice with his joined hands (water) on the joined hands (of the student),
2	2	11	. And seizing (the student's) hands with (his own) hands, holding the right uppermost, he murmurs,
2	2	12	'By the impulse of the god Savitar, with the arms of the two Asvins, with Pûshan's hands I initiate thee, N.N.'
2	2	13	Those who are desirous of a host (of adherents, he should initiate) with (the verse), 'Thee, (the lord) of hosts' .
2	2	14	Warriors with (the verse), 'Come here, do not come to harm' .
2	2	15	Sick persons with the Mahâvyâhritis.
2	3	1	. 'Bhaga has seized thy hand, Savitar has seized thy hand, Pûshan has seized thy hand, Aryaman has seized thy hand. Mitra art thou by right, Agni is thy teacher, and I, N.N., both of us. Agni, I give this student in charge to thee. Indra, I give this student in charge to thee. Sun, I give this student in charge to thee. Visve devâs, I give this student in charge to you, for the sake of long life, of blessed offspring and strength, of increase of wealth, of mastership of all Vedas, of renown, of bliss.'
2	3	2	. 'In Indra's course I move; in the sun's course I move after him'—with these words he turns round from left to right,
2	3	3	And grasping down with the span of his right hand over (the student's) right shoulder he touches the place of his heart with the words, 'May I be dear to thy inviolate heart.'
2	3	4	Having silently turned round from right to left,
2	3	5	. And then laying his hand with the fingers upwards on his (i.e. the student's) heart, he murmurs:
2	4	1	. 'Under my will I take thy heart; my mind shall thy mind follow; in my word thou shalt rejoice with all thy heart; may Brihaspati join thee to me.'
2	4	2	. 'Thou art the Brahmakârin of Kâma, N.N.!'
2	4	3	. With the same text  he turns round as before,
2	4	4	And touching with the span of his right hand (the student's) right shoulder, he murmurs:
2	4	5	. 'A student art thou. Put on fuel. Eat water. Do the service. Do not sleep in the day-time. Keep silence till the putting on of fuel.'
2	4	6	With (the words), 'Thine, Agni, is this piece of wood,' he puts the fuel on (the fire), or silently.
2	5	1	. After one year (the teacher) recites the Sâvitrî (to the student),
2	5	2	(Or) after three nights,
2	5	3	Or immediately.
2	5	4	. Let him recite a Gâyatrî to a Brâhmana,
2	5	5	A Trishtubh to a Kshatriya,
2	5	6	A Gagatî to a Vaisya.
2	5	7	But let it be anyhow a verse sacred to Savitar.
2	5	8	They seat themselves to the north of the fire,
2	5	9	. The teacher with his face turned eastward, the other westward.
2	5	10	. After (the student) has said, 'Recite, sir!'—
2	5	11	The teacher, having pronounced the word OM, then causes the other one to say, 'Recite the Sâvitrî, sir!'
2	5	12	He then recites the Sâvitrî to him, the verse 'That glorious (splendour) of Savitar' ; (firstly) pâda by pâda, (then) hemistich by hemistich, (and finally) without a stop.
2	6	1	. 'Waters are ye by name; happy ones are ye by name; sappy ones are ye by name; undecaying ones are ye by name; fearless ones are ye by name; immortal ones are ye by name. Of you, being such, may I partake; receive me into your favour'—with these words (the teacher) makes the student sip water three times,
2	6	2	. And hands over to him the staff with the fiveverses, 'Blessing may give us' .
2	6	3	. An optional gift is the fee for the sacrifice.
2	6	4	. After (the teacher) has led him round the fire, turning his right side towards it, (the student) goes through the village to beg food.
2	6	5	(Let him beg,) however, of his mother first,
2	6	6	Or of a woman who will not refuse.
2	6	7	. Having announced the alms to his teacher, he may eat (the food himself) with the master's permission.
2	6	8	The daily putting on of fuel, the going for alms, the sleeping on the ground, and obedience to the teacher: these are the standing duties of a student.
2	7	1	. Now (follows the exposition) of the study of the Veda.
2	7	2	. Both sit down to the north of the fire,
2	7	3	The teacher with his face to the east, the other one to the west.
2	7	4	. After (the student) has reverentially saluted the teacher's feet and has sprinkled his (own) hands (with water),
2	7	5	And has kneeled down with his right knee on young Kusa shoots at their roots,
2	7	6	. And has grasped round (those Kusa shoots) in 'heir middle with his hands, holding the right uppermost,
2	7	7	The teacher, having seized them at their topswith his left hand, and with his right hand sprinkling them with water, then makes the other say:
2	7	8	. 'Recite the Sâvitrî, sir!' says the other.
2	7	9	'I recite the Sâvitrî to thee!' says the teacher.
2	7	10	. 'Recite the Gâyatrî, sir!' says the other.'I recite the Gâyatrî to thee!' says the teacher.
2	7	11	'Recite the verse of Visvâmitra, sir!' says the other.'I recite the verse of Visvâmitra to thee!' says the teacher.
2	7	12	'Recite the Rishis, sir!' says the other.I recite the Rishis to thee!' says the teacher.
2	7	13	'Recite the deities, sir!' says the other.'I recite the deities to thee!' says the teacher.
2	7	14	'Recite the metres, sir!' says the other.'I recite the metres to thee!' says the teacher.
2	7	15	'Recite the Sruti, sir!' says the other.'I recite the Sruti to thee!' says the teacher.
2	7	16	'Recite the Smriti, sir!' says the other.'I recite the Smriti to thee!' says the teacher.
2	7	17	. 'Recite faith and insight, sir!' says the other.'I recite faith and insight to thee!' says the teacher.
2	7	18	. In that way, according to what Rishi each hymn belongs to and what its deity and its metre is, thus (with the corresponding indications of Rishi, &c.) let him recite each hymn;
2	7	19	. Or also, if he does not know the Rishis, deities, and metres, the teacher recites this verse, 'That glorious (splendour) of Savitar' , pâda by pâda, hemistich by hemistich, (and finally) without a stop, and says, when he has finished, 'This (verse belongs to Savitar; it is a Gâyatrî; Visvâmitra is its Rishi).'
2	7	20	Let him thus recite (the hymns belonging to) each Rishi, or (each) Anuvâka;
2	7	21	. Of the short hymns (in the tenth Mandala) an Anuvâka,
2	7	22	Or as much as the master may think fit.
2	7	23	Or optionally he may recite the first and last hymn of (each) Rishi,
2	7	24	. Or of (each) Anuvâka,
2	7	25	(Or) one (verse) of the beginning of each hymn.
2	7	26	The teacher may optionally say at the beginning of the hymn, 'This is the commencement.'
2	7	27	. This has been (further) explained in (the treatise about) the Rishisvâdhyâya.
2	7	28	. When (the lesson) is finished, he takes the young Kusa shoots, makes of cow-dung a pit at their roots, and sprinkles water on the Kusa (shoots) for each hymn.
2	7	29	. For the rest of the day standing and fasting.
2	8	1	. In the afternoon, having obtained by begging fried barley grains, he shall sacrifice them with his hand on the fire according to the rites of the Âgya oblations with the text, 'The lord of the seat, thewonderful' , verse by verse, down to the end of the hymn,
2	8	2	. Causing the teacher by (the gift of) food to pronounce auspicious wishes.
2	9	1	. In the forest, with a piece of wood in his hand, seated, he performs the Sandhyâ (or twilight devotion) constantly, observing silence, turning his face north-west, to the region between the chief (west) point and the intermediate (north-western) point (of the horizon), until the stars appear,
2	9	2	. Murmuring, when (the twilight) has passed, the Mahâvyâhritis, the Sâvitrî, and the auspicious hymns.
2	9	3	In the same way in the morning, turning his face to the east, standing, until the disk of the sun appears. . When (the sun) has risen, the study (of the Veda) goes on.
2	10	2	Every day in the evening and in the morning,
2	10	3	He establishes the fire (in its proper place), wipes (with his hand the ground) round (it), sprinkles (water) round (it), bends his right knee,
2	10	4	. (And puts fuel on the fire with the texts,) 'To Agni I have brought a piece of wood, to the great Gâtavedas; may he, Gâtavedas, give faith and insight to me. Svâhâ!'Firewood art thou; may we prosper. Fuel art thou; splendour art thou; put splendour into me. Svâhâ!'Being inflamed make me prosperous in offspring and wealth. Svâhâ!Thine is this fuel, Agni; thereby thou shalt grow and gain vigour. And may we grow and gain vigour. Svâhâ!'
2	10	5	Having then sprinkled (water) round (the fire),
2	10	6	He approaches the fire with the verse, 'May Agni (vouchsafe) to me faith and insight, not-forgetting (what I have learned) and memory; may this praiseful Gâtavedas give blessing to us.'[
2	10	7	. He makes with ashes the tripundhra sign (the sign of three strokes) which is set forth in the (treatise on the) Sauparnavrata, which is revealed, which agrees with the tradition handed down by the ancients, with the five formulas 'The threefold age' , one by one, on five (places), viz. the forehead, the heart, the right shoulder and the left, and then on the back.]
2	10	8	He who approaches the fire after having sacrificed thus, studies of these Vedas, one, two, three, or all.
2	11	1	. Now (follows) the directing to the (special) observances.
2	11	2	. The rules for it have been explained by the initiation.
2	11	3	He does not recite the Sâvitrî.
2	11	4	. Some say that the handing over of the staff forms the end (of this ceremony).
2	11	5	During the northern course of the sun, in the time of the increasing moon—
2	11	6	. The teacher having abstained through one day and one night, from sexual intercourse and from eating flesh—
2	11	7	. With the exclusion of the fourteenth day and of the eighth (of the half-month),
2	11	8	And of the first and last, according to some (teachers),
2	11	9	. Or on what day else the constellation seems lucky to him, on that day he shall direct (the student) to the duties of holiness according to the Sukriya rite.
2	11	10	. Let him observe (those) duties through three days, or twelve days, or one year, or as long as the master may think fit.
2	11	11	The Sâkvara (observance), however, (is to be kept) one year.
2	11	12	(So also) the Vrâtika and Aupanishada (observances).
2	11	13	. When the time has elapsed, when the dutieshave been observed, when the Veda has been studied down to the Samyu-Bârhaspatya-(hymn), let (the teacher then), should he intend to instruct (the student) in the secret (part of the Veda), ascertain the time (through which the student has to observe the special rites) and the rules to be observed, from the (special) directions (that are handed down on this subject).
2	12	1	. After (the student) has eaten something in the morning, in the afternoon, to the north-east—
2	12	2	Having sacrificed, the teacher then asks him with regard to those deities to whom he has been given in charge , 'Hast thou fulfilled the duties of holiness before Agni, Indra, the Sun, and the Visve devâs?'
2	12	3	If he answers, 'I have fulfilled them, sir!'—
2	12	4	The teacher three times envelops, from the left to the right, with a fresh garment the face (of the student) who is standing behind the fire, in front of the teacher, with his face to the east.
2	12	5	. He turns the skirt (of that garment) upwards so that it cannot slip down,
2	12	6	. (And says) 'Leaving off for three days the putting on of fuel, the going for alms, the sleeping on the ground, and the obedience to the teacher, fast in the forest, in a god's house or in a place where Agnihotra is performed, keeping silence, with earnest care.'
2	12	7	Here some (teachers) prescribe the same observances only for one night, during which he is to stand.
2	12	8	. The teacher refrains from eating flesh and from sexual intercourse.
2	12	9	When those three days or that night has elapsed, going out from the village he shall avoid to look at the following (persons or things) that form impediments for the study (of the Veda):
2	12	10	. Raw flesh, a Kandâla, a woman that has lately been confined, or that has her courses, blood, persons whose hands have been cut off, cemeteries, and all sorts of corpse-like (animals?) which enter (their dens?) with the mouth first (?), keeping them away from the place where he dwells.
2	12	11	Going out (from the village) in a north-eastern direction the teacher sits down on a clean spot. turning his face to the east.
2	12	12	. When the sun has risen, he recites, in the way prescribed for the Veda-study, (the Âranyaka texts to the student) who is to keep silence and who wears a turban.
2	12	13	. This rule is to be observed only for the Mahânâmnî verses.
2	12	14	At the sections however that follow (after the Mahânâmnîs) the other one hears while the teacher recites them for himself.
2	12	15	He gives (to the teacher) the turban, a vessel, a good cow.
2	12	16	(The teacher accepts the gifts) with the verses,[paragraph continues] 'Thou him' , and, 'High in the sky' , or (he accepts them) all with the Pranava (i.e. the syllable Om).
2	12	17	Here some prepare a mess of rice for the Visve devâs at all sections (of the Âranyaka);
2	12	18	. For the gods to whom he has been given in charge, according to Mândûkeya.
2	13	1	Now (follow) the rules regarding the staff.
2	13	2	Let him not leave a passage between himself and the staff.
2	13	3	. Now should any one of these things, viz. staff, girdle, or sacrificial cord, break or rend, the same penance (takes place) therefore which (has been prescribed) at the wedding with regard to the chariot.
2	13	4	If the girdle cannot be repaired, he makes another and speaks over it (the following verses):
2	13	5	'Thou who knowest the distinction of pure and impure, divine protectress Sarasvatî, O girdle, prolong my vow unimpaired, unbroken.'Thou, Agni, art the pure bearer of vows. Agni, carry hither the gods to our sacrifice and our oblation.'Bearing the vows, the infallible protector of vows, be our messenger, undecaying and mighty. Giving treasures, merciful, Agni, protect us, that we may live, Gâtavedas!
2	13	6	And he ties the sacrificial cord to the staff.
2	13	7	Here it is said also:
2	13	8	. 'Let him sacrifice the sacrificial cord and the staff, the girdle and also the skin in water after the completion of his vow with a Varuna-verse or with the essence (of the Vedas, i.e. the syllable Om).
2	14	1	. Now (follows) the Vaisvadeva (sacrifice).
2	14	2	. The rite of the sacrifice has been explained.
2	14	3	Let him pour oblations of prepared Vaisvadeva food in the evening and in the morning into the (sacred) domestic fire.
2	14	4	'To Agni svâhâ! To Soma svâhâ! To Indra and Agni svâhâ! To Vishnu svâhâ! To Bharadvâga Dhanvantari svâhâ! To the Visve devâs svâhâ! To Pragâpati svâhâ! To Aditi svâhâ! To Anumati svâhâ! To Agni Svishtakritsvâhâ!'—having thus offered the oblations belonging to those deities,
2	14	5	He then shall offer Balis (i.e. portions of food) in the centre of the floor to the same deities; (then another Bali with the words,) 'Adoration to Brahman and to the Brâhmanas!' and (with the verse), 'Vâstoshpati, accept us'  in the centre of the floor to Vâstoshpati.
2	14	6	. He then distributes Balis, from the left to the right, through the different quarters (of the horizon, to the presiding deities) in due order (with the words),
2	14	7	'Adoration to Indra and to those belonging to Indra! Adoration to Yama and to those belonging to Yama! Adoration to Varuna and to those belonging to Varuna! Adoration to Soma and to those belonging to Soma! Adoration to Brihaspati and to those belonging to Brihaspati!'
2	14	8	. Then (turned) towards the disk of the sun, 'Adoration to Aditi and to the Âdityas! Adoration
2	14	5	'He shall offer a Bali to those deities, i.e. to those ten deities to whom he has sacrificed, to Agni, &c. , addressing them with the word, "Adoration (to such and such a deity")—because in the other cases the word "adoration" (namah) has been prescribed for the Bali.' Nârâyana.to the Nakshatras, to seasons, to months, to half-months, to days and nights, to years!'
2	14	9	'To Pûshan, the path-maker; to Dhâtar, to Vidhâtar, and to the Maruts'—(thus) on the thresholds.
2	14	10	To Vishnu on the grindstone.
2	14	11	'To the tree'—(thus) in the mortar.
2	14	12	'To the herbs'—(thus) where the herbs are kept.
2	14	13	'To Parganya, to the waters'—(thus) near the water-pot.
2	14	14	'Adoration to Srî'—(thus) in the bed at the head, 'to Bhadrakâlî at the foot.
2	14	15	In the privy, 'Adoration to Sarvânnabhûti!'
2	14	16	Then (he throws a Bali) into the air, in the evening with the words, 'To the night-walkers,' in the morning with the words, 'To the day-walkers,' and with the Verse,' Which gods' .
2	14	17	To the unknown deities to the north, and to Dhanapati (i.e. the Lord of treasures).I
2	14	8	With the sacrificial cord suspended over the right shoulder he pours out the remnant to the south with the verse, 'They whom the fire has burnt' .
2	14	19	When he has made his offerings to gods, fathers (i.e. Manes), and men, let him give food to a Srotriya (i.e. to a learned Brâhmana).
2	14	20	Or let him give alms (of food) to a student.
2	14	21	. Let him immediately afterwards offer food to a female under his protection, to a pregnant woman, to boys, and to old people.
2	14	22	. Let him throw (some food) on the ground for the dogs, for the dog-butchers, and for the birds.
2	14	23	. Let him eat nothing without having cut off (and offered as a Bali) a portion thereof.
2	14	24	(Let him) not (eat) alone,
2	14	25	Nor before (the others).
2	14	26	With regard thereto it has been said also in the Rik,' In vain the fool gains food' .
2	15	1	. Should any one of the six persons  to whom the Arghya reception is due, visit (him), let him make (ready) a cow, a goat, or what (sort of food) he thinks most like (thereto).
2	15	2	. Let the Argha not be without flesh.
2	15	3	On the occasion of a sacrifice and of a wedding let (the guest) say, 'Make it (ready).'
2	15	4	The animal (offered) to the teacher is sacred to Agni;
2	15	5	If offered to an officiating priest, to Brihaspati;
2	15	6	. If to the father-in-law, to Pragâpati;
2	15	7	If to a king, to Indra;
2	15	8	. If to a friend, to Mitra;
2	15	9	If to a Snâtaka, to Indra and Agni;
2	15	10	Even if he performs more than one Soma sacrifice during a year, let only priests who have received (from him) the Arghya reception officiate for him, not such who have not received it.
2	15	11	. Here it is said also:
2	16	1	'At the Madhuparka and at the Soma sacrifice, at the sacred rites for fathers (Manes) and gods only animals may be killed, not elsewhere: thus has Manu said.
2	16	2	'Both his teacher and his father, and also a friend who does not stay in his house as a guest: whatever these dispose, that let him do; such is the established custom.
2	16	3	. 'Let him not consider as a guest a person living in the same village, or one that comes in returning from a journey; (but let him consider as a guest only) one who has arrived at his house where the wife or the fires (of the host) are.
2	16	4	. '(The fire of) the Agnihotra, bulls, and a guest that has come in at the right time, children and persons of noble families: these burn up him who neglects them.
2	16	5	'A bull, the Agnihotra, and a student, these three prosper only if they eat; there is no prosperity for them, if they do not eat.
2	16	6	'Day by day the domestic deities approach the man who performs the domestic rites, in order to receive their share; (that) let him pour out to them.
2	17	1	'Even if a man constantly gather grass and perform the Agnihotra, a Brâhmana who stays (in hishouse) without receiving honour takes away all his good works.
2	17	2	'One should give (even) if it were only a water-pot; one should sacrifice (even) if it were a piece of wood; (even) down to one hymn or to one Anuvâka the Brahmayagña is enjoined.
2	17	3	'When on a journey let him not fast; (during that time) the wife keeps the vow. Let his son, his brother, or his wife, or his pupil offer the Bali oblation.
2	17	4	'Those who perform this Vaisvadeva sacrifice in the evening and in the morning, they will prosper in wealth and (long) life, in fame and offspring.'
2	18	1	A student who is going to set out on a journey, speaks thus to his teacher:
2	18	2	. 'Of inhalation and exhalation'—(this he says) in a low voice; 'Om, I will dwell'—this aloud.
2	18	3	(The teacher) in a low voice (replies), 'To inhalation and exhalation I, the wide-extended one, resort with thee. To the protecting god I give thee in charge. God Savitar; this student belongs to thee; I give him in charge to thee; protect him; do not forsake him.'
2	18	4	'Om, hail!' the teacher aloud. 'Hail!' the teacher aloud.Here ends the Second Adhyâya.
3	1	1	A bath (shall be taken by the student) when he is going to return home (from his teacher).
3	1	2	. 'A bull's hide'—this has been declared. On that hide he makes him sit down and have his hair and beard cut and the hair of the body and the nails.
3	1	3	Having had (the cut-off hair-ends, &c.) thrown away together with rice and barley, with sesamum-seed and mustard-seed, with Apâmârga and Sadâpushpî flowers,
3	1	4	. Having sprinkled him (with water) with the Âpohishthîyâ-hymn ,
3	1	5	Having adorned him,
3	1	6	Having dressed him with two garments with (the verse), 'The garments both of you' ,
3	1	7	He then puts on him a golden ornament (with the words), 'Giving life and vigour' .
3	1	8	With (the verse), 'Mine, Agni, be vigour' , the veiling (of the head is done).
3	1	9	With (the verse), 'House by house the shining one'  (he takes) the parasol,
3	1	10	With (the verse), 'Rise up' , the shoes,
3	1	11	With (the verse), 'Long be thy hook'  he takes a bamboo staff.
3	1	12	. Let him sit that day in solitude.
3	1	13	With (the verses), 'O tree! with strong limbs,' and, 'A ruler indeed'  let him mount the chariot.
3	1	14	(Before returning home) let him first approach a place where they will perform Argha for him with a cow or a goat.
3	1	15	Or let him return (making his start) from cows or from a fruit-bearing tree.
3	1	16	With (the verses), 'Indra, give us best goods,' and, 'Be friendly, O earth'  he descends (from the chariot).
3	1	17	Let him eat that day his favourite food.
3	1	18	. To his teacher he shall give (that) pair of garments, the turban, ear-rings and jewel, staff and shoes, and the parasol.
3	2	1	. If he wishes to have a house built, he draws with an Udumbara branch three times a line round (the building-ground) with (the words), 'Here I include the dwellings for the sake of food,' and sacrifices in (its) centre on an elevated spot,
3	2	2	(With the texts,) 'Who art thou? Whose artthou? To whom do I sacrifice thee, desirous of (dwelling in the) village? Svâhâ!'Thou art the gods' share on this (earth). From here have sprung the fathers who have passed away. The ruler has sacrificed, desirous of (dwelling in the) village, not omitting anything that belongs to the gods. Svâhâ!'
3	2	3	Having had the pits for the posts dug,
3	2	4	He pours water-gruel into them,
3	2	5	And with (the verse), 'This branch of the immortal one I erect, a stream of honey, promoting wealth. The child, the young one, cries to it; the cow shall low to it, the unceasingly fertile one'—he puts an Udumbara branch which has been besmeared with ghee into the pit for the right door-post.
3	2	6	'This branch of the world I establish, a stream of honey, promoting wealth. The child, the young one, cries to it; the cow shall low to it that has a young calf'—thus to the left.
3	2	7	In the same way at the two (pits) to the south, to the west, and to the north.
3	2	8	With (the verse), 'This branch of this tree, that drops ghee, I erect in the immortal. The child, the young one, cries to it; cows shall flock to it, unceasingly fertile ones'—he erects the chief post.
3	2	9	. 'May the young child come to it, may the calf . . . .; may they come to it with a cup of Parisrut, with pots of curds.
3	3	1	. 'Stand here, O post, firm, rich in horses and cows, . . . .; stand safely, dropping ghee; stand here, fixed in the ground, prosperous, long-lasting(?), amid the prosperity of people who satiate themselves. May the malevolent ones not reach thee!'Hither are called the cows; hither are called goats and sheep; and the sweet essence (?) of food is called hither to our house.'Stand fast in the Rathantara; recline on the Vâmadevya; establish thyself on the Brihat'—with (these texts) he touches the chief post.
3	3	2	When the house has been built conformably (to its proper dimensions), he touches the posts.
3	3	3	The two (posts) to the east with (the words), 'Truth and faith!'
3	3	4	Those to the south with (the words), 'Sacrifice and gift!'
3	3	5	Those to the west with (the words), 'Strength and power!'
3	3	6	Those to the north with (the words), 'The Brahman and the Kshatra!
3	3	7	. 'Fortune the pinnacle, law the chief post!
3	3	8	'Day and night the two door jambs!'
3	3	9	'The year the roof!'
3	3	10	With (the verse), 'A bull, an ocean' ' let him bury an anointed stone under the pinnacle.
3	4	1	. At the sacrifice to Vâstoshpati—
3	4	2	. Having established the (sacred) domestic fire outside with (the words), 'I place (here) Agni with genial mind; may he be the assembler of goods. Do no harm to us, to the old nor to the young; be a saviour to us, to men and animals!'—
3	4	3	Having put a new water-pot on fresh eastward-pointed Kusa-grass,
3	4	4	And spoken over it (the words), 'Unhurt be our men, may our riches not be squandered!'—
3	4	5	. He sacrifices three oblations in the forenoon with the Stotriya text of the Rathantara with repetition and Kakubh-forming;
3	4	6	(Three oblations with the Stotriya) of the Vâmadevya at midday;
3	4	7	Of the Brihat in the afternoon;
3	4	8	The four Mahâvyâhritis, the three verses, 'Vâstoshpati!' , (the single verses,) 'Driving away calamity,' (and) 'Vâstoshpati,a firm post' , and to (Agni) Svishtakrit a tenth oblation of cooked food at night.
3	4	9	Taking with himself his eldest son and his wife, carrying grain, let him enter (the house with the words),'Indra's house is blessed, wealthy, protecting; that I enter with my wife, with offspring, with cattle, with increase of wealth, with everything that is mine.'
3	5	1	'To every able one, to every blissful one, to you I turn for the sake of safety, of peace. Free from danger may we be. May the village give me in charge to the forest. All! give me in charge to the great one,'—thus (he speaks) when leaving the village.
3	5	2	'May the forest give me in charge to the village. Great one! give me in charge to the all'—thus (he speaks) when entering the village, not without (carrying) something (with himself, such as fuel, flowers, &c.)
3	5	3	. I enter the blessed, joyful house, which does not bring death to men; manly (I enter) that which is rich in men. Bringing refreshment, dropping ghee (we enter the house) in which I shall joyfully rest'—this verse is constantly to be pronounced (when he enters the house).
3	6	1	One who has not set up the (sacred Srauta) fires, when setting out on a journey, looks at his house.
3	6	2	(He murmurs the text,) 'Do ye both, Mitra and Varuna, protect this house for me; unscathed, undisturbed, may Pûshan guard it till our return;'
3	6	3	And murmurs (the verse), 'Upon the path we have entered' .
3	7	1	When he then returns from his journey, he looks at his house (and says),
3	7	2	. 'House, do not fear, do not tremble; bringing strength we come back. Bringing strength, joyful and wise, I come back to thee, to the house, rejoicing in my mind.'That of which the traveller thinks, that in which dwells much joy, that I call the house. May it know us as we know it.'Hither are called the cows; hither are called goats and sheep; and the sweet essence (?) of food is called hither to our house.'
3	7	3	Having approached the (sacred) domestic fire with the verse, 'This Agni is glorious to us, this is highly glorious. Worshipping him (?) may we suffer no harm; may he bring us to supremity'—
3	7	4	Let him pronounce auspicious words.
3	7	5	. When accepting the water for washing the feet he says, 'The milk of Virâg art thou; may I obtainthe milk of Virâg; in me (may) the milk of Padyâ Virâg (dwell)!'
3	8	1	. When one who has not set up the (sacred Srauta) fires, is going to partake of the first-fruits (of the harvest), let him sacrifice to the Âgrayana deities with (Agni) Svishtakrit as the fourth, and with the word SVÂHÂ, on his (sacred) domestic fire.
3	8	2	Having recited over (the food) which he is going to eat (the formula), 'To Pragâpati I draw thee, the proper portion, for luck to me, for glory to me, for food to me!'—
3	8	3	. He thrice eats of it, sprinkling it with water, with (the verse), 'From the good you have led us to the better, ye gods! Through thee, the nourishment, may we obtain thee. Thus enter into us, O potion, bringing refreshment; be a saviour to us, to men and animals!'
3	8	4	With (the verse), 'This art thou, breath; the truth I speak This art thou; from all directions thou hast entered (into all beings). Thou driving away old age and sickness from my body be at home with me. Do not forsake us, Indra!'—he touches the place of the heart;
3	8	5	With (the words), 'The navel art thou; do not fear; the knot of the breathing powers art thou; do not loosen thyself,' (he touches) the navel;
3	8	6	With the verse, 'Bliss with our ears' , (lie touches) the limbs as stated (in that verse);
3	8	7	Worshipping the sun with the verse, 'Yonder eye' .
3	9	1	. 'May the noisy (goddesses) keep you away from slaughtering hosts. May the entire share, O cows, that belongs to this lord of cows, suffer no harm among you—(and)'May Pûshan go after our cows' —this he shall speak over the cows when they go away (to their pasture-grounds).
3	9	2	'May Pûshan hold' , when they run about.
3	9	3	'May they whose udder with its four holes is full of sweet and ghee, be milk-givers to us; (may they be) many in our stable, rich in ghee'—and, 'The cows have come' , when they have come back.
3	9	4	The last (verse) when he puts them in (into the stable).
3	9	5	The hymn, 'Refreshing wind' , (he recites over the cows), when they are gone into the stable.
3	10	1	The new moon that follows after the Phâlgunafull moon, falls under (the Nakshatra) Revatî: on that (new moon day) he shall have the marks made (on his cattle),
3	10	2	. With (the words), 'Thou art the world, thousandfold prospering. To Indra may exertion (?) give thee. Inviolate art thou, unhurt, sap, food, protection. For as many (cows) I shall do this now, for more (than these) may I do it in the latest year.'
3	10	3	Of that (cow) that calves first let him sacrifice the biestings with the two verses, 'Yearly the milk of the cow' .
3	10	4	If she brings forth twin-calves, let him sacrifice with the Mahâvyâhritis, and give the mother of the twins (to the Brâhmanas).
3	11	1	. Now (follows) the Vrishotsarga (i.e. setting a bull at liberty).
3	11	2	On the Kârttika full moon day or on that day of the Âsvayuga (month) that falls under (the Nakshatra) Revatî—
3	11	3	He sacrifices, after having kindled amid the cows a well-inflamed fire, Âgya oblations (with the words),
3	11	4	Here is delight; take delight here. Svâhâ![paragraph continues] Here is still-standing; here is (your) own still-standing. Svâhâ!'I have let the calf join its mother. May the calf, sucking its mother's breast, support increase of wealth among us. Svâhâ!'
3	11	5	With the verse, 'May Pûshan go after our cows'  he sacrifices from (a mess of sacrificial food) belonging to Pûshan.
3	11	6	. Having murmured the Rudra-(hymns),
3	11	7	(He takes) a one-coloured, two-coloured, or three-coloured (bull),
3	11	8	Or one that protects the herd,
3	11	9	Or that is protected by the herd,
3	11	10	Or it may also be red.
3	11	11	It should have all its limbs complete, and be the finest (bull) in the herd.
3	11	12	Having adorned that (bull),
3	11	13	And the four best young cows of the herd, having adorned those too,
3	11	14	. (He says,) 'This young (bull) I give you as your husband; sporting with him, your lover, walk about. Do not desert us (?), being joined (with us) from your birth. In increase of wealth, in food may we rejoice. Svâhâ!'
3	11	15	When (the bull) is in the midst (of the cows), he recites over (them), 'Refreshing,' &c.  down to the end of the Anuvâka.
3	11	16	With the milk of all of them he shall cook milk-rice and feed Brâhmanas with it.
3	12	1	. After the Âgrahâyanî (or the full moon day of the month Mârgasîrsha) (follow) the three Ashtakâs in the second fortnight (of the Mârgasîrsha and of the two following months).
3	12	2	At the first of these he sacrifices vegetables,
3	12	3	. With (the verse), 'She who shone forth first is this (earth); she walks, having entered into this (earth). The wife has brought forth (children), the new-creating mother. May the three powers follow her. Svâhâ!'
3	12	4	Now (the oblation for Agni) Svishtakrit,
3	12	5	. With (the verses), 'She in whom Yama, the son of Vivasvat, and all gods are contained, the Ashtakâ whose face is turned to all sides, she has satiated my desires.'They call thy teeth "the pressing-stones;" thyudder is (Soma) Pavamâna; . . . . are the months and half-months. Adoration to thee, O glad-faced one! Svâhâ!'
3	13	1	. At the middle (Ashtakâ) and in the middle of the rainy season,
3	13	2	The four Mahâvyâhritis (and) the four (verses), They who have thirsted' : having quickly recited (these verses) he shall sacrifice the omentum;
3	13	3	Or (he shall do so) with the verse, 'Carry the omentum, Gâtavedas, to the Manes, where thou knowest them in the world of virtue. May streams of fat flow to them; may the wishes of the sacrificer be fulfilled. Svâhâ!'
3	13	4	(Then follow) the four Mahâvyâhritis (and) the four (verses), 'They who have thirsted' : (thus is offered) an eightfold oblation of cooked food, together with the cut-off portions.
3	13	5	. Or, 'Interposed are the mountains; interposed is the wide earth to me. With the sky and all the points of the horizon I interpose another one instead of the father. To N.N. svâhâ!'Interposed to me are the seasons, and days and nights, the twilight's children. With the months and half-months I interpose another one instead of the father. To N.N. svâhâ!'With the standing ones, with the streaming ones. with the small ones that flow about: with the waters, the supporters of all I interpose another one instead of the father. To N.N. svâhâ!'Wherein my mother has done amiss, going astray, faithless to her husband, that sperm may my father take as his own; may another one fall off from the mother. To N.N. svâhâ!'—these four (verses) instead of the Mahâvyâhritis, if (the sacrificer) is an illegitimate child.
3	13	6	Or milk-rice (should be offered).
3	13	7	. On the next day the Anvashtakya ceremony (i.e. ceremony following the Ashtakâ) in accordance with the rite of the Pindapitriyagña.
3	14	1	On the last (Ashtakâ) he sacrifices cakes,
3	14	2	With the words, 'The Ukthya and the Atirâtra. the Sadyahkrî together with the metre—Ashtakâ![paragraph continues] Preparer of cakes! Adoration to thee, O glad-faced one. Svâhâ!
3	14	3	. A cow or a goat is the animal (to be sacrificed), or a mess of cooked food (should be offered).
3	14	4	Or he may optionally offer food to a cow.
3	14	5	. Or he may optionally burn down brushwood in the forest and say, 'This is my Ashtakâ.'
3	14	6	But let him not neglect to do (one of these things). But let him not neglect to do (one of these things).Here ends the Third Adhyâya.
4	1	1	. Let him offer (Srâddha oblations) every month to the fathers.
4	1	2	. Having invited an uneven number of Brâhmanas, versed in the Veda, at least three, to sit down as (representing) the fathers,
4	1	3	And having strewn sesamum into an uneven number of water-pots,
4	1	4	He shall pour them out over the hands of the Brâhmanas, assigning (this gift) to them with the words, 'N.N.! This to thee!'
4	1	5	. After this they should be adorned;
4	1	6	And after he has (respectfully) spoken to them, and has put food into the fire,
4	1	7	Assigning (the food) to them with the words, 'N.N.! This to thee!' he shall cause them to eat.
4	1	8	While they are eating, he shall murmur the Mahâvyâhritis, the Sâvitrî, the Madhuvâtîya-verses , and verses addressed to the Manes and to (Soma) Pavamâna.
4	1	9	. When they have finished with eating, he shall offer the lumps (of flour).
4	1	10	. Before (their dinner he shall offer) the lumps, according to some (teachers).
4	1	11	Behind (these he places the lumps) for their wives, putting something between (these and the preceding ones).
4	1	12	To the Brâhmanas he shall announce the remnants.
4	1	13	. The rites of the putting (of food) into the fire , &c. have been declared (in the Srauta-sûtra) by the Pindapitriyagña.
4	2	1	Now (follows) the Ekoddishta (i.e. the Srâddha ceremony directed to a single dead person),
4	2	2	With one strainer,
4	2	3	. One (pot of) Argha-water,
4	2	4	One lump (of flour).
4	2	5	. No inviting (takes place here), nor the putting(of food) into the fire, nor (do) the Visve devâs (take part in this ceremony). 'Relished?'—thus are they to be asked whether they are satiated. 'May it approach (the fathers),' instead of 'imperishable.'
4	2	6	'Be satisfied,' when sending them away.
4	2	7	Thus through one year, when one has died.
4	2	8	. And (then) omission of the fourth one.
4	3	1	. Now (follows) the Sapindîkarana (i.e. reception of a dead person into the community of Pinda-offerings with the other Manes).
4	3	2	. When one year has elapsed, or three half-months,
4	3	3	Or on a day when something good happens,
4	3	4	He fills four water-pots with sesamum, scents, and water,
4	3	5	Three for the fathers, one for the (newly) dead person,
4	3	6	And pours the pot that belongs to the (newly) dead person out into the pots of the fathers with the two verses, 'They who commonly' .
4	3	7	Thus also the lump (of flour).
4	3	8	This is the Sapindîkarana.
4	4	1	. Now (follows) the Âbhyudayika (i.e. the Srâddha ceremony referring to good luck).
4	4	2	In the fortnight of the increasing moon, on an auspicious day,
4	4	3	. After the sacrifice to the mothers has been performed,
4	4	4	And an even number of (Brâhmanas) versed in the Veda have been invited to sit down;
4	4	5	In the forenoon;
4	4	6	. The rite is performed from left to right.
4	4	7	. The murmuring with the omission of the verses belonging to the Manes.
4	4	8	The Darbha blades are straight.
4	4	9	. Barley is to be used instead of sesamum.
4	4	10	The lumps are mixed with curds, jujube fruits, fried grain.
4	4	11	. On inviting (the Manes, he should say), 'The Nândîmukha (glad-faced?) Manes will I invite.'
4	4	12	. 'May the Nândîmukha Manes be rejoiced,' instead of 'imperishable.'
4	4	13	. 'The Nândîmukha Manes will I make speak,' when he makes (the Brâhmanas) speak.
4	4	14	. '(Was it) well done?'—thus are they to be asked whether they are satiated.
4	4	15	The rest is the same (as in the other kinds of Srâddha rites), as far as it is not  (by contrary rules).
4	5	1	. Now (follows) the Upâkarana (i.e. the ceremony by which the annual course of study is opened).
4	5	2	. When the herbs appear, under the Nakshatra Hasta or Sravana,
4	5	3	Let him make oblations of the flour of fried barley and of grains, mixed with curds and ghee, with the (whole) Veda, verse by verse: thus say some (teachers).
4	5	4	. Or with the first verses of the Sûktas and Anuvâkas.
4	5	5	With the first verses of the Adhyâyas and of the sections belonging to the (different) Rishis, according to Mândûkeya.
4	5	6	But Kaushîtaki has said:
4	5	7	'I praise Agni the Purohita' , this one verse,
4	5	8	'The Kushumbhaka (mungoose?) has said it;' 'If thou criest, O bird, announce luck to us;' 'Sung by Gamadagni;' 'In thy abode the whole world rests;'[paragraph continues] 'Come to our sacrifice, O you that are worthy of sacrifice, with care;' 'Whosoever, be he ours, be he alien;' 'Look on, look about;' 'Come here, Agni, the Maruts’ friend;' 'The oblation, O king, cooked for thee:' each time two verses,
4	5	9	. 'That blessing and bliss we choose'—this one verse (the first and last verse of each Mandala).
4	5	10	(Taking something) of the remnants of the sacrificed (food) they partake of that sacrificial food with this (verse), 'I praised Dadhikrâvan' .
4	5	11	They sip water, sit down,
4	5	12	Murmur the Mahâvyâhritis, the Sâvitrî, and the auspicious hymns commencing from the beginning of the Veda,
4	5	13	And cause the teacher to pronounce auspicious wishes.
4	5	14	Of this (ceremony) it is also said,
4	5	15	'Desirous (of acquiring) for the hymns inexhaustible vigour, reverence, and also soundness, the Rishis, by the power of their austerities, have discovered the Upâkarman.
4	5	16	. 'Therefore a constant performer of the six kinds of works should, in order that his Mantras might be successful, perform the Upâkarman—so they say—if he wishes for success of his (holy) works.
4	5	17	. 'At the time of the Upâkarman and of the Utsarga an interruption (of the Veda-study) shall take place for (three days and) three nights, likewise at the Ashtakâs for one day and one night, and so on the last night of each season.'
4	6	1	. On the first day of the bright fortnight of Mâgha,
4	6	2	To the north-east,
4	6	3	In a place covered with herbs,
4	6	4	Having murmured the hymns sacred to the Sun, 'Upwards that Gâtavedas' , 'The bright face of the gods' , Adoration to Mitra's (eye)' , 'From the sky (where he dwells) may Sûrya protect us' ,
4	6	5	And having thrown clods of earth (on the ground) to the different quarters (of the horizon), from the left to the right, with the hymn, 'A ruler indeed' , verse by verse,
4	6	6	. And having satiated (with water) the Rishis, the metres, the deities, faith and insight, and the fathers man by man,
4	6	7	They interrupt (the study of) the hymns for six months and a half,
4	6	8	Or for five and a half.
4	6	9	But if they (wish to) recite them (nevertheless), let the recitation go on after a pause of one day and one night.
4	7	1	Now the interruption (of the Veda recitation):—
4	7	2	. In the case of prodigies until the same time (next day),
4	7	3	And in the case of other miracles;
4	7	4	In the case of lightning, thunder, and rains (the recitation shall be interrupted) till the twilight has thrice passed;

4	7	11	. And (on the death) of those whose family-head he is.
4	7	12	On receiving (gifts) as at the Srâddha.
4	7	13	On (the death of) a fellow-student;
4	7	14	When he has followed (the funeral of) a dead person,
4	7	15	And when he has laid down the lumps of flour to the fathers.
4	7	16	At night;
4	7	17	During twilight;
4	7	18	On the full and change of the moon;
4	7	19	After sunset;
4	7	20	In the neighbourhood of a Sûdra;
4	7	21	. When the sound of a Sâman is heard;
4	7	22	On a burial ground;
4	7	23	. In a wilderness which belongs to the village;
4	7	24	In a village where a corpse is;
4	7	25	On seeing forbidden sights;
4	7	26	On hearing what is forbidden;
4	7	27	On smelling a foul smell;
4	7	28	If a high wind blows;
4	7	29	. If a cloud emits (heavy) rain;
4	7	30	On a carriage road;
4	7	31	And while the sound of a lute is heard;
4	7	32	While being on a chariot;
4	7	33	(In the neighbourhood) of a dog as (in that) of a Sûdra;

4	7	48	With veiled hands;
4	7	49	In an army;
4	7	50	In presence of a Brâhmana who has not had his meal, and of cows (that have eaten nothing);
4	7	51	When (these impediments) have passed, let them (continue to) recite (the Veda).
4	7	52	Should any of these cases arise against his will, let him (continue to) recite after having held his breath and looked at the sun.
4	7	53	. (The same rules hold good,) except (those regarding) lightning, thunder, and rain, for (the study of) the Kalpa. During the five months and a half (they have to behave) as while it rains.
4	7	54	Thereof it is also said,
4	7	55	. 'Food, water, roots and fruits, and whatsoever else Srâddha-food there may be: even when he has (only) accepted thereof, the study should be interrupted; the Brâhmana's hand is his mouth; so it is taught.'
4	8	1	. And to (students) who have been duly initiated he shall set forth (the Veda);
4	8	2	The teacher sitting to the east or to the north, the other one to the south, with his face turned to the north.
4	8	3	Or two (students shall be so seated).
4	8	4	But more (than two) as there is room (for them).
4	8	5	He should not sit on a high seat in presence of a Guru,

4	8	13	'OM,' replies the other.
4	8	14	Thereafter let him recite uninterruptedly.
4	8	15	When he has recited, he embraces (his teacher's feet),
4	8	16	Says, 'We have finished, sir!' and (goes away) according to his business.
4	8	17	(He shall say,) 'Leave! Pause meanwhile!' according to some (teachers).
4	8	18	Let no one step between (a teacher and students) who study.
4	8	19	. Let no one change his place during the recitation.
4	8	20	Should any fault be committed, let him fast three days, or one day and one night, repeat the Sâvitrî as long as he can, and give something to the Brâhmanas; then after an interruption of one day and one night the study should go on.
4	9	1	. Having bathed,
4	9	2	And having submerged himself at the time prescribed for the bath, he satiates the deities:
4	9	3	. 'Agni may satiate himself; Vâyu may satiate himself; Sûrya may satiate himself; Vishnu may satiate himself; Pragâpati may satiate himself; Virûpâksha may satiate himself; Sahasrâksha may satiate himself; Soma, Brahman, the Vedas, the gods, the Rishis, and all the metres, the word Om, the word VASHAT, the Mahâvyâhritis, the Sâvitrî, the sacrifices, heaven and earth, the Nakshatras, the air, days and nights, the numbers, the twilights, the oceans, the rivers, the mountains, fields, herbs, trees, Gandharvas and Apsaras, the serpents, the birds, the Siddhas, the Sâdhyas, the Vipras, the Yakshas, the Rakshas, the beings that have these (Rakshas, &c.) at their end, may satiate themselves.'I satiate the Sruti; I satiate the Smriti; I satiate the firmness; I satiate the delight; I satiatethe success; I satiate the thought; I satiate belief and insight, and the memory, cows and Brâhmanas, movable and immovable things. All beings may satiate themselves!'—so far with the sacrificial cord suspended over the left shoulder.
4	10	1	Now with the sacrificial cord suspended over the right shoulder,
4	10	2	Looking in the direction that belongs to the Manes (i.e. the south):
4	10	3	'The (Rishis) of the hundred (Rikas), the (Rishis) of the middle (Mandalas), Gritsamada, Visvâmitra, Gamadagni, Vâmadeva, Atri, Bharadvâga, Vasishtha, the Pragâthas, the (Rishis) of the Pavamâna hymns, the (Rishis) of the short hymns and of the long hymns, Sumantu, Gaimini, Vaisampâyana, Paila, the Sûtras, the Bhâshyas, Gârgya, Babhru, Bâbhravya, Mandu, Mândavya, Gârgî Vâkaknavî,[paragraph continues] Vadavâ Prâtitheyî, Sulabhâ Maitreyî (may satiate themselves).'(I satiate) Kahola Kaushîtaki, Mahâkaushîtaki, Suyagña Sâṅkhâyana, Âsvalâyana, Aitareya, Mahaitareya, Bhâradvâga, Gâtûkarnya, Paiṅgya, Mahâpaṅgya, Bâshkala, Gârgya, Sâkalya, Mândûkeya, Mahâdamatra, Audavâhi, Mahaudavâhi, Sauyâmi, Saunaki, Sâkapûni, Gautami; and whatsoever other teachers there are, may they all satiate themselves.

4	11	13	Gleaning ears of corn, receiving alms unasked for, or for which he has asked the good, performing sacrifices for others, are the means of livelihood;
4	11	14	(Of these) each preceding one is the more respectable.
4	11	15	. Or if (his livelihood) cannot be gained (in one of the ways mentioned), let him follow the occupation of a Vaisya.
4	11	16	(He shall be) careful about his duties towards Manes and gods.

4	13	4	When the plough is being put into motion first, let a Brâhmana touch the plough reciting this (verse), 'For luck may us the plough-shares' .
4	13	5	'Through the lord of the field'—with (this hymn) , verse by verse, to the different directions (of the sky), from left to right, worship is done.

5	11	2	. Then, after having fasted three nights (and days), he should perform the great expiation.Here ends the Fifth Adhyâya.
6	1	1	. Now, after having paid reverence to Brahman, to the Brahmarishi, to (those who descend from) Brahman's womb, to Indra, Pragâpati, Vasishtha, Vâmadeva, Kahola Kaushîtaki, Mahâkaushîtaki, Suyagña Sâṅkhâyana, Âsvalâyana, Aitareya, Mahaitareya, Kâtyâyana, Sâtyâyana, Sâkalya, Babhru, Bâbhravya, Mandu, Mândavya, and to all the teachers of the past, we will henceforth explain the rules for the Âranyaka as forming the subject of Svâdhyâya (private recitation of a text).
6	1	2	. The teacher abstains through one day and one night from sexual intercourse and from eating flesh.
6	1	3	. Raw flesh, a Kandâla, a woman that has lately been confined, or that has her courses, seeing blood or persons whose hands have been cut off: (these persons and things he shall know form) impediments for the study.
6	1	4	And of the corpse-like (animals?).
6	1	5	Those which enter (their dens?) with the mouth first (?).
6	1	6	. When he has vomited, or when his beard has been shaved,
6	1	7	. When he has eaten flesh or partaken of a Srâddha or birth dinner,
6	1	8	During the days that immediately follow on (days of) study in the village,
6	1	9	Three nights (and days), if (he has been) put out of order,
6	1	10	(Or has been violently) seized by others,
6	1	11	And during the second half of the days that precede (?) the Parvan days,
6	1	12	And if fire-flames, lightning, thunder, (heavy) rains, and great clouds appear,
6	1	13	And if a storm (blows) that carries away pebbles, as long as that lasts.
6	1	2	,
6	1	1	During four months after the full moon of Âshâdha let him not study.
6	1	2	. Especially the Sakvarî verses (are concerned by what has been declared). Such are the rules.
6	2	3	. Let them go to a clean spot in the north-eastern direction, that receives its light from the east.
6	2	4	The drawing of water (should be done) before sunrise,
6	2	5	. And the entering into the circle with this verse, 'She who smells of salve' .
6	2	6	. The circle should have its entrance to the east or to the north; it should be (praised as) excellent among the people, not too spacious, not too narrow.
6	2	7	. The final expiation (should extend) to the Vâmadevya.
6	2	8	And the invitation to resume the recitation (is done in the following way)
6	2	9	After they have sipped water that stands outside the circle,
6	2	10	Let them resume the recitation, having performed the expiation.
6	2	11	If the vessel used in the expiation is damaged, sprinkling (with water forms) the expiatory act (to be performed for it).
6	2	12	(That) sprinkling, however, (one should perform) holding gold or a bunch of Darbha grass in his hand.
6	2	13	So far what pertains to the general rules.
6	3	1	Now after they have entered the circle—
6	3	2	. The teacher sits down with his face to the east, the others, according to their rank, (sit down) towards the south, with their faces to the north.
6	3	3	If that is impossible, with their faces to all directions.
6	3	4	Let them expect the rising of the sun,
6	3	5	And when they behold it in its splendour,
6	3	6	. Let them with (the words), 'Recite, sir!' seize with their hands, holding the right hand uppermost, the feet of the teacher, which have been washed, with the right (hand) the right (foot), with the left the left,
6	3	7	. And having then put (the hands) into the vessel used for the expiation, into water in which pieces of Dûrvâ stalks are, let them begin their study, when their hands have ceased to drip.
6	3	8	This is the rite. But when they are tired, let one of them bring it about that the vessel used for the expiation be not empty.
6	3	9	And all (should do so) at the beginning and the end of (each) Adhyâya.
6	3	10	. (All) that is done continuously, without interruption.
6	3	11	Now the expiation.
6	3	12	. The syllable OM, the Mahâvyâhritis, the Sâvitrî, the Rathantara, the Brihat, the Vâmadevya; Brihat and Rathantara with repetition and Kakubh-forming.
6	3	13	. These (holy words and verses) are (thus) made to attain (the number of) ten.
6	3	14	. 'Of decades consists the Virâg'—thus says the Brâhmana.
6	4	1	. 'Unerring mind, vigorous eye (is) the sun, the noblest of the stars. Inauguration, do no harm to me!'—with (these words) they look at Savitri (I.e. the sun).
6	4	2	One (verse), 'You both the gladdening one' , and the three (verses), 'Blessing to us on the paths'  (are to be repeated before the recitation) of the Mahâvrata (chapter).
6	4	3	But (at that) of the Sakvarî (verses) before (the formula mentioned in the first Sara):
6	4	4	. The three Trikas, 'To him, the thirsty one' , 'The wealthiest (Soma), O wealthy one' , 'Him who does no harm to you' , (the verse), 'To him, to him the sap of the herb' , (and the verse), "Verily thou art a hero' —thus for the Sakvarî (verses) before and afterwards.
6	4	5	Now for the Upanishad (texts)—
6	4	6	The same (recitation) as for the Mahâvrata.
6	4	7	. For the Samhitâs, however, before (the text given in the first Sûtra the formula has to be recited), 'I shall speak right, I shall speak truth (&c.)'—this is the difference (in the case of the Samhitâs).
6	4	8	. Now for the Mantha the two verses (have to be recited) before (the formula given in the first Sûtra), 'This we entreat of Savitar,' 'That glorious (splendour) of Savitar' .
6	4	9	With (the formula), 'Unerring mind' , then follow the expiatory formulas that belong to the (different) sections.
6	4	10	(All) this on one day.
6	6	1	Having worshipped the Sun with (the verses), 'Savitri from the west,' 'This eye' ,
6	6	2	. They turn away, come back, sit down.
6	6	3	With (the words), 'As the water is appeased'—they draw water out of the vessel used for the expiation,
6	6	4	Pour it out on the ground,
6	6	5	. Spread (some) of that (water over the ground) with (the words), 'As the earth (is appeased),'—
6	6	6	. He (then) smears it on his right shoulder with (the words), 'Thus may peace dwell in me.'
6	6	7	In the same way a second time.
6	6	8	In the same way a third time.
6	6	9	'Piece by piece thou art produced; piece by piece thou risest up; bring welfare to us, O house!'—with (this text they) take pieces of Dûrvâ stalks (out of the vessel of water), put them on their heads,
6	6	10	. (And make water-offerings with the formulas), 'May Agni satiate himself; may Vâyu satiate himself; may Sûrya satiate himself; may Vishnu satiate himself; may Pragâpati satiate himself; may Virûpâksha satiate himself; may Sahasrâksha satiate himself; may all beings satiate themselves.'
6	6	11	. (Then) Sumantu, Gaimini, Vaisampâyana, Paila, and the other teachers (receive their offerings).
6	6	12	. (Then) every one (worships in the same way) his fathers.
6	6	13	With (the text), 'To the sea you'  they pour out the water,
6	6	14	Murmur the Vâmadevya,
6	6	15	And separate according to their pleasure.
6	6	16	(The final benedictory formula runs thus), 'Through the power of wisdom, of Sruti and Smriti, as handed down by tradition, through (that power) which has its measure in (the Vedic texts) that have been gone through(?), and which is possessed ofundisputed firmness, may peace be with us in welfare. Adoration be to gods, Rishis, Manes, and men! May they whom we have adored, make happy life, beauty, health, peace, incolumity, imperishableness, vigour, splendour, glory, power, holy lustre, renown, age, offspring, cattle, adoration, increase. From wrongly spoken, wrongly used (prayer), from everything that is deficient or excessive, for the good of gods and Rishis, may the Brahman and Truth protect me; may the Brahman and Truth protect me!'End of the Sixth Adhyâya.End of the Sâṅkhâyana-Grihya.
