1	1	1	Now henceforth we shall explain the domestic sacrifices.
1	1	2	He should perform (the ceremonies) wearing the sacrificial cord on his left shoulder and having sipped water.
1	1	3	During the northern course of the sun, at the time of the increasing moon, on an auspicious day, before noon: this he should know as the (proper) time (for performing the ceremonies).
1	1	4	And as the prescription (is stated with regard to the time of the single ceremonies).
1	1	5	All (ceremonies) are accompanied by the Anvâhârya (Srâddha).
1	1	6	At the end (of each ceremony) he should feed worthy (Brâhmanas) according to his ability.
1	1	7	A student, after he has studied the Veda, when going to put the last piece of wood (on the fire),—
1	1	8	Or to seize a wife's hand (i.e. to marry her),—
1	1	9	Should fetch water from a hidden place, should sweep a place which is inclined towards north-east, or which is level, and should besmear it (with cow-dung). Beginning from the centre of it he should draw a line from west to east, (another line) from south to north which touches that line at its western end, and three lines from west to east (touching the northwards-turned line at three different points) in its midst (i.e. at neither of its ends). He then should besprinkle (those lines with water).
1	1	10	In this way the Lakshana (i.e. the preparation of the place for the sacred fire) is performed everywhere.
1	1	11	With the words 'Bhûr, bhuvah, svah,' they carry the fire forward (to that place) so that they have it in front of them.
1	1	12	Or after the householder has died, the chief[paragraph continues] (of the family) should do it (i.e. he should set up the sacred fire).
1	1	13	In this way, on the coincidence of an (auspicious) Tithi and an (auspicious) Nakshatra, (or of such a Nakshatra) and a Parvan—
1	1	14	On the full-moon day or on the new-moon day: then he should celebrate the setting up of his (sacred domestic) fire.
1	1	15	He should get fire from a Vaisya's house or from a frying-pan, and should set it up (as his sacred fire);
1	1	16	Or (he should fetch it) from the house of one who offers many sacrifices, be it a Brâhmana, or a Râganya, or a Vaisya.
1	1	17	Or he may kindle another fire by attrition and may set it up.
1	1	18	That is pure, but it does not bring prosperity.
1	1	19	He may do what he likes  the last piece of wood (on the fire), or when he sacrifices when going to seize the hand of a wife, that fire he should keep.
1	1	21	That becomes his (sacred) domestic fire.
1	1	22	Thereby his morning oblation has been offered.
1	1	23	Beginning from that time the sacrificing (of regular morning and evening oblations) in the domestic fire is prescribed, so that he begins with an evening oblation.
1	1	24	Before the time has come for setting the fire in a blaze, he should fetch in the evening and in the morning from a hidden place the water with which the different acts (such as sipping water) are performed.
1	1	25	Or (he should fetch water only) in the evening.
1	1	26	Or he should draw it out of a water-pot or of a barrel.
1	1	27	Before sunset he should set the fire in a blaze, and sacrifice the evening oblation after sunset.
1	1	28	In the morning he should set the fire in a blaze before sunrise, and should sacrifice the morning oblation before sunrise or after it.
1	2	1	He takes as his yagñopavîta (i.e. sacrificial cord) a string, or a garment, or simply a rope of Kusa grass.
1	2	2	Raising his right arm, putting the head into (the upavîta), he suspends (the cord) over his left shoulder, so that it hangs down on his right side: thus he becomes yagñopavîtin.
1	2	3	Raising his left arm, putting the head into (the upavîta), he suspends it over his right shoulder, so that it hangs down on his left side: thus he becomes prâkînâvîtin.
1	2	4	Prâkînâvîtin, however, he is only at sacrifices offered to the Manes.
1	2	5	Having gone in a northern direction from the fire, having washed his hands and feet, and having seated himself, he should sip water three times and wipe off (the water) twice.
1	2	6	Having besprinkled his feet (with water) let him besprinkle his head.
1	2	7	Let him touch the organs of his senses with water:
1	2	8	The two eyes, the nose, the two ears.
1	2	9	Whatever (limb of his body) requires his consideration (whether it is pure or not), that he should touch with water (i.e. with a wet hand).
1	2	10	Here they say:
1	2	11	Let him not touch (himself with water, or sip water) while walking,
1	2	12	Nor standing,
1	2	13	Nor laughing,
1	2	14	Nor looking about,
1	2	15	Nor without bending down,
1	2	16	Nor (throwing up the water) with his fingers,
1	2	17	Nor except with the (proper) Tîrtha,
1	2	18	Nor uttering a sound,
1	2	19	Nor without looking (at the water),
1	2	20	Nor with his shoulders put back,
1	2	21	Nor wearing a part of his under garment as if it were an upper garment,
1	2	22	Nor with warm water,
1	2	23	Nor with foamy water,
1	2	24	And in no case wearing sandals,
1	2	25	(Not) with a turban on his head (?),
1	2	26	(Not with his garment) tied round his neck,
1	2	27	And not stretching out his feet.
1	2	28	When he has finally touched (water) again, he becomes pure.
1	2	29	Let him, however, sip only water that reaches his heart.
1	2	30	For if he does otherwise, he remains impure.
1	2	31	Now the cases in which he has to touch (water) a second time.
1	2	32	Having slept, or eaten, or sneezed, or taken a bath, or drunk something, or changed (his garments), or walked on the high road, or gone to a cemetery, he should sip water and then sip water again.
1	3	1	Having put wood on the (sacred) fire, having swept"(the ground) round it, he should, bending his right knee, pour out to the south of the fire his joined hands full of water with (the words), 'Aditi! Give thy consent!'
1	3	2	To the west with (the words), 'Anumati! Give thy consent!'
1	3	3	To the north with (the words), 'Sarasvatî! Give thy consent!'
1	3	4	With (the words), 'God Savitri! Give thy impulse!'  he should sprinkle (water) round the fire once or thrice so as to keep his right side turned towards it—
1	3	5	Interchanging the points at which he begins and ends the (sprinkling of water), and sprinkling so as to encompass what he is going to offer (with the streams of water).
1	3	6	Let him then make oblations of the sacrificial food, be it prepared or raw, over the fire.
1	3	7	If it is raw, he should sacrifice after having washed it and having let the water drop off.
1	3	8	If it consists in curds or milk or rice gruel, (he should sacrifice it) with a brazen bowl, or with the pot in which the oblations of boiled rice are prepared, or also with the (sacrificial spoon called) Sruva;
1	3	9	In the evening the first (oblation) with (the formula), 'To Agni Svâhâ!' the second silently, in the middle and in the north-eastern part (of the fire);
1	3	10	In the morning the first (oblation) with (the formula), 'To Sûrya Svâhâ!' the second again silently, again in the middle and in the north-eastern part (of the fire).
1	3	11	Having put a piece of wood (on the fire), and having again sprinkled (water) round it, he should pour out again his joined hands full of water in the same way ; in the Mantras he says, 'Thou hast given thy consent' (instead of 'Give thy consent').
1	3	12	Having circumambulated the fire so as to turn his right side towards it, having poured out the remains of water, and filled the vessel again, and put it (in its proper place), (he may do) whatever his business is.
1	3	13	In that way, from that time (in which he has begun to offer the two daily sacrifices) he should sacrifice, or should have sacrificed, over the (sacred) domestic fire, till the end of his life.
1	3	14	Here now they say:
1	3	15	'If they like, his wife may offer the morning and evening oblations over the domestic fire. For his wife is (as it were) his house, and that fire is the domestic fire.'
1	3	16	When the morning meal or the evening meal is ready, he should make (his wife) say, 'It is ready!'—
1	3	17	In an unbroken voice (?), having made himself pure,
1	3	18	He replies in a loud voice, 'Om!' Then ina low voice: 'To that (food) I bring adoration. May it not fail!'
1	4	1	He then should silently offer the Balis.
1	4	2	Let him speak only what refers to the due preparation of the food. With guests he may converse, if he likes.
1	4	3	He then should take some portion of food which is fit for sacrifice, should pour over it some liquid fit for sacrifice (such as ghee, milk, or curds), and should sacrifice it silently in the fire with his hand.
1	4	4	The first oblation is sacred to Pragâpati, the second to (Agni) Svishtakrit.
1	4	5	He then should offer the Balis, inside or outside (the Agnyagâra), having well cleansed the ground.
1	4	6	Let him pour out water once, and put down Balis in four places, and finally sprinkle once (water on the four Balis).
1	4	7	Or let him for each Bali which he puts down, sprinkle (water) before and afterwards.
1	4	8	What he puts down first, that is the Bali belonging to the Earth. What in the second place, to Vâyu. What in the third place, to the Visve devâs. What in the fourth place, to Pragâpati.
1	4	9	Then he should offer other Balis (near) the water-pot, the middle (post, and) the door: the first Bali is sacred to the Waters, the second to the Herbs and Trees, the third to the Ether.
1	4	10	Then he should offer another Bali in the bed or in the privy. That Bali belongs either to Kâma or to Manyu.
1	4	11	Then (another Bali) on the heap of sweepings; that (belongs) to the hosts of Rakshas.
1	4	12	The remnants of the Balis he should besprinkle with water, and should pour them out towards the south from right to left; they belong to the Fathers.
1	4	13	Let him sacrifice in the fire sitting.
1	4	14	Let him make the oblation to the Fathers sitting; the other (Balis he may offer) as it happens.
1	4	15	He should, however, offer those Balis himself as long as he stays at home.
1	4	16	Or another person who must be a Brâhmana (should offer them for him).
1	4	17	Both the husband and his wife (should offer them):
1	4	18	This is the rule for householders.
1	4	19	The wife in the evening, the man in the morning: thus (it is stated).
1	4	20	He should offer such Balis of all food whatever, be it prepared for the Fathers, or for auspiciouspurposes (for instance, for being offered to Brâhmanas), or for (ordinary) purposes.
1	4	21	Only in the case of a sacrifice (this rule) ceases.
1	4	22	If rice and barley are prepared for one and the same meal, he should, having offered (Balis) of the one or the other (kind of food), consider his duty as fulfilled.
1	4	23	If the food is cooked at different times for one meal, he should perform this Bali ceremony only once.
1	4	24	If food is prepared at different places for one family, he should perform this Bali ceremony only from (the food which is prepared in) the kitchen belonging to the householder.
1	4	25	However (of the persons belonging to the family) he whose food becomes ready before (that of the householder), (that person) should offer the prescribed portion in the fire, and give to a Brâhmana his share (of the food), and then should eat himself.
1	4	26	He whose (food becomes ready) after (that of the householder), should only eat.
1	4	27	Here they say also:
1	4	28	'At the end of that offering of Balis let him pronounce a wish. Then it will be fulfilled to him.'
1	4	29	He himself, however, should offer the Âsasya Bali, from the barley(-harvest) till the rice(-harvest), and from the rice(-harvest) till the barley(-harvest). This is called the Âsasya Bali.
  This Bali is called â-sasya, because it is offered until (â) the next crop (sasya) is ripe. As to the regulation that the sacrificer has to offer it himself, compare above,
1	4	30	Thus he obtains long life.
1	4	31	When a donation has been made, he should offer a Bali of chaff, of the scum of boiled rice, and of water. This is sacred to Rudra. This is sacred to Rudra.
1	5	1	Now at the times of the new moon and of the full moon (the following ceremonies are performed).
1	5	2	Let him fast on that full-moon day (when the full moon rises) at the meeting (of day and night).
1	5	3	The following day, according to some (teachers).
1	5	4	And on that day on which the moon is not seen, (he should fast, considering it) as the new-moon day.
1	5	5	The ends of the half-months are the time for fasting, the beginnings for sacrifice.
1	5	6	With the sacrificial food of the new-moonsacrifice he celebrates the first half (of the month), with that of the full-moon sacrifice the second.
1	5	7	Full-moon is the greatest distance of sun and moon; new-moon is their nearest approach.
1	5	8	That day on which the moon is not seen, that he should take as the day of new-moon.
1	5	9	Sometimes he may also while (the moon) is (still) visible (accept it as the day of new-moon); for (already then the moon) has made its way.
1	5	10	The time of full-moon is reckoned in three ways: (when the full moon rises at) the meeting (of day and night), or when it rises after sunset, or when it stands high (in the sky at sunset).
1	5	11	Now on what day it becomes full—
1	5	12	The doctrine on this point has to be studiedseparately. One should study it, or should ascertain separately (the exact time of) the Parvan from those who know it.
1	5	13	Now on the day which is the fast-day, on that day, in the forenoon, having offered his morning oblation, he besmears that surface on which the fire is placed, on all sides with cow-dung.
1	5	14	He then gets the pieces of wood ready (which are to be put on the fire)—of Khadira or of Palâsa wood.
1	5	15	If Khadira or Palâsa wood cannot be obtained, it may be wood—as far as it serves the purpose—of any tree, with the exception of Vibhîdaka, Tilvaka, Bâdhaka, Nîva, Nimba, Râgavriksha, Salmali, Aralu, Dadhittha, Kovidâra, Sleshmâtaka wood.
1	5	16	The Barhis consists of Kusa grass cut off at the points at which the blades diverge from the main stalk.
1	5	17	(The blades should be) cut off near the roots at (the ceremonies directed to) the Fathers.
1	5	18	If that (i.e. Kusa grass) cannot be obtained, (he may take) any kind of grass, with the exception of Sûka grass, of Saccharum reed, of such grass as is apt to break, of Balbaga grass, of Mutava, of Amphidonax reed, of Suntha.
1	5	19	(He should get ready the following things, viz.) Âgya, rice or barley to be cooked for the sacrifice, the pot in which the oblation of cooked rice (or barley) is prepared, the pot-ladle, the Sruva, the water fetched from a hidden place—
1	5	20	And the other things which we shall mention in the course of (our exposition of) the ritual.
1	5	21	On that day he should not go away (from his house on a journey, &c.);
1	5	22	Even from a distant place he should return to his house.
1	5	23	(On that day) he may buy goods from others, but not sell (such goods).
1	5	24	Let him not speak much.
1	5	25	Let him strive to speak the truth.
1	5	26	In the afternoon husband and wife, after having bathed, should eat fast-day food which is pleasant to them. It should contain butter (and should be prepared) in the due way.
1	6	1	Thus has spoken Mânatantavya: 'Unoffered indeed becomes the offering of a man who does not eat fast-day food.
1	6	2	'He becomes powerless. Hunger will attack him. He does not gain favour among people. His offspring will be perverse.
1	6	3	'But he who eats fast-day food, becomes powerful. Hunger will not attack him. He gainsfavour among people. His offspring will be still more blessed.
1	6	4	'Therefore (husband and wife) should eat fast-day food which is pleasant to them.'
1	6	5	Let them sleep that night on the ground.
1	6	6	They should spend that night so as to alternate their sleep with waking, entertaining themselves with tales or with other discourse.
1	6	7	But they should avoid doing anything unholy (such as cohabiting together).
1	6	8	It is said, that when on a journey, he should not fast.
1	6	9	For (say they, in that case) the observance has to be kept by his wife.
1	6	10	Let him do (herein) what he likes.
1	6	11	In the same way also one who has set up the (Srauta) fires should fast—
1	6	12	And (he should observe) what is enjoined by the sacred tradition.
1	6	13	Now in the forenoon, after (the sacrificer) has offered his morning oblation, and has walked round the fire on its front side, and strewn to the south of the fire eastward-pointed Darbha grass—
1	6	14	(The Brahman) stations himself to the east of that (grass), facing the west, and with the thumb and the fourth finger of his left hand he takes one grass blade from the Brahman's seat and throws it away to the south-west, in the intermediate direction (between south and west), with (the words), 'Away has been thrown the dispeller of wealth.'
1	6	15	Having touched water, he then sits down on the Brahman's seat, with (the words), 'I sit down on the seat of wealth.'
1	6	16	Facing the fire he sits silently, raising his joined hands, till the end of the ceremony.
1	6	17	Let him speak (only) what refers to the due performance of the sacrifice.
1	6	18	Let him not speak what is unworthy of the sacrifice.
1	6	19	If he has spoken what is unworthy of the sacrifice, let him murmur a verse, or a Yagus, sacred to Vishnu.
1	6	20	Or let him only say, 'Adoration to Vishnu!'
1	6	21	If one wishes, however, to do himself the work both of the Hotri and of the Brahman, he should in the same way place on the Brahman's seat a parasol, or an outer garment, or a water-pot, or abolster of Darbha grass, and should return in the same way (in which he has gone to the Brahman's seat), and then should perform the other (duties).
1	7	1	He then washes the mortar, the pestle, and the winnowing basket, strews to the west of the fire eastward-pointed Darbha grass, and puts (the mortar, &c.) on (that grass).
1	7	2	He then pours out, with a brazen vessel or with the pot in which the oblations of cooked rice are prepared, the grain destined for sacrifice, rice or barley—
1	7	3	Once pronouncing the name of the deity (to whom the offering will be made): 'Agreeable to such and such (a deity) I pour thee out;' twice (it is done) silently.
1	7	4	Then to the west, with his face turned eastward, he begins to husk the grain, with his right hand lying over the left.
1	7	5	After the grain has three times been winnowed, he should wash it thrice (if it is destined) for the gods, they say, twice, if for men, once, if for the Fathers.
1	7	6	Having put a (Darbha) purifier (into the potin which the oblation is to be prepared), he should pour the grain (into it).
1	7	7	He should cook the mess of sacrificial food so that it is well cooked, stirring it up (with the pot-ladle) from left to right.
1	7	8	When it has been cooked, he should sprinkle (Âgya) on it, should take it from the fire towards the north, and should again sprinkle (Âgya) on it.
1	7	9	Having put wood on the fire, he should strew Kusa grass round it on all sides, to the east, to the south, to the north, to the west—
1	7	10	On all sides in three layers or in five layers—
1	7	11	Thick, so that always an uneven number (of blades) are put together.
1	7	12	(He should strew) eastward-pointed grass, covering the roots with the points.
1	7	13	Or he should strew it to the west (of the fire), and should draw (some of the grass which he has strewn) from the south end and (some) from the north end, in an easterly direction.
1	7	14	He should (arrange the grass so as to) lay the points of the southern blades uppermost.
1	7	15	This rule for strewing (grass) round (the fire is valid) for all (ceremonies) at which oblations are made.
1	7	16	Some lay also branches of Samî wood or of Parna wood round (the fire).
1	7	17	To the north (of the fire) a Sruva full of water (is placed): this is the Pranîta water;
1	7	18	If there is (such water). Or it may be dispensed with, say some (teachers).
1	7	19	Having put the mess of cooked food on the Barhis, and put wood (on the fire), he prepares the Âgya.
1	7	20	(He may take) ghee, or oil made from Tila seeds, or curds, or milk, or rice gruel.
1	7	21	From that same Barhis (he takes two Darbha blades and) makes purifiers (of them), of the length of one span.
1	7	22	Putting an herb between (them and the instrument with which he cuts them), he cuts them off, not with his nail, with (the words), 'Purifiers are ye, sacred to Vishnu.'
1	7	23	He then wipes them with water, with (the words), 'By Vishnu's mind ye are purified.'
1	7	24	Having purified (the Âgya by pouring it into the Âgya pot, over which he has laid a Darbha purifier), he purifies it (in the pot) with the two northward-pointed purifiers (in the following way):
1	7	25	Holding them with his two thumbs and fourth fingers, he purifies (the Âgya) three times, from west to east, once with the Yagus: 'May the god Savitri purify thee with this uninjured purifier, with the rays of the good sun;' twice silently.
1	7	26	He then should sprinkle them with water and should throw them into the fire.
1	7	27	Then, having put that Âgya on the fire, he should take it from (the fire) towards the north.
1	7	28	This is the way to prepare the Âgya.
1	8	1	To the east (is placed) the Âgya, to the west the mess of cooked food.
1	8	2	Having sprinkled (water) round (the fire) and poured Âgya on the mess of cooked food, he begins to sacrifice simply with the pot-ladle, picking out portions of the sacrificial food (without 'underspreading' and pouring Âgya over the Havis).
1	8	3	If he intends, however, to sacrifice so as to 'underspread' (the Havis with Âgya) and to pour (Âgya) over it, let him sacrifice first the two Âgya portions (in the following way):
1	8	4	He should take four portions of Âgya—five portions (are taken) by the Bhrigus—and should sacrifice from west to east, on the northern side with (the formula), 'To Agni Svâhâ!' on the southern side with (the words), 'To Soma Svâhâ!'
1	8	5	He then cuts off (two or three Avadânas) from the Havis, having 'spread under' (Âgya).
1	8	6	(Two Avadânas) from the middle and from the east side, if he (belongs to the families who) makefour Avadânas. (Three Avadânas) from the middle, from the east and from the west side, if (he belongs to those who) make five Avadânas.
1	8	7	He sprinkles (Âgya) on the cut-off portions.
1	8	8	He anoints the places from which he has cut them off (with Âgya) in order that the strength (of the Havis) may not be lost.
1	8	9	He should sacrifice over the middle of the fire with (the words), 'To Agni Svâhâ!'—
1	8	10	Once or thrice, in that same way.
1	8	11	Now for the Svishtakrit (oblation), after having 'spread under' (Âgya), he cuts off once a very big (Avadâna) from the eastern part of the northern part (of the Havis), Twice he should sprinkle (Âgya) on it.
1	8	12	But if he (belongs to the families who) make five Avadânas, he should 'spread under' twice, and cut off (the Avadâna), and sprinkle (Âgya) on it twice.
1	8	13	He does not anoint the place from which he has cut off, in order that the strength (of the Havis) may be lost.
1	8	14	With the words, 'To Agni Svishtakrit[paragraph continues] Svâhâ!' he should sacrifice it over the eastern part of the northern part (of the fire).
1	8	15	He should sacrifice oblations of Âgya on (the chief oblations of cooked sacrificial food), with the Mahâvyâhritis.
1	8	16	The insertion (stands) before the Svishtakrit (oblation).
1	8	17	If different sacrifices are performed together, there is only one sweeping (of the ground) round (the fire) , one (putting of) fuel (on the fire) , one Barhis, one sprinkling (of water) round (the fire) , one Âgya, and one offering of the two Âgyabhâgas .
1	8	18	Having cut off (the Avadânas) for all (the single sacrifices), he sacrifices the Svishtakrit oblation only once.
1	8	19	After he has sacrificed, he should throw that pot-ladle (which he has used in the preceding ceremonies) into the fire.
1	8	20	Or having washed it, he should take with it (the rest of the sacrificial food), and should eat that.
1	8	21	The Sruva he should not throw into the fire, say some (teachers).
1	8	22	By one who has not set up the sacred fires, the mess of cooked food should be offered to Agni at the festivals both of the full and of the new moon.
1	8	23	To Agni, or to Agni and Soma, by one who has set them up, at the full-moon (sacrifice);
1	8	24	To Indra, or to Indra and Agni, or to Mahendra, at the new-moon (sacrifice).
1	8	25	Or also one who has set up the sacred fires, should offer it to Agni at the festivals both of the full and of the new moon.
1	8	26	Having put a piece of wood (on the fire), and having afterwards sprinkled (water) round (the fire), he performs the Yagñavâstu ceremony (in the following way):
1	8	27	From that same Barhis he should take a handful of Kura grass, and should dip it thrice into the Âgya or into the Havis, the points, the middle, and the roots, with (the words), 'May the birds come, licking what has been anointed.'
1	8	28	He then should besprinkle that (handful of grass) with water, and should throw it into the fire with (the verse), 'Thou who art the lord of cattle, Rudra, who walkest with the lines (of cattle), the manly one: do no harm to our cattle; let this be offered to thee! Svâhâ!
1	8	29	This (ceremony) they call Yagñavâstu.
1	9	1	He then should take away the remnants of the Havis in a northern direction, should take them out (of the vessel in which they are), and should give them to the Brahman.
1	9	2	He should try to satiate him.
1	9	3	They say indeed with regard to sacrifice: 'Through the Brâhmana's being satiated (with sacrificial food) I become satiated myself.'
1	9	4	Then (he should give to the Brahman) what other food has just become ready.
1	9	5	Then he should try to gain the favour of Brâhmanas by (gifts of) food.
1	9	6	A full vessel constitutes the fee for the sacrifice; that he should give to the Brahman.
1	9	7	A brazen vessel or a wooden cup which has been filled with food, with prepared food or with raw food, or even only with fruits: this they call a full vessel.
1	9	8	The Brahman is the only officiating priest at the Pâkayagñas.
1	9	9	(The sacrificer) himself is Hotri.
1	9	10	A full vessel  is the lowest sacrificial fee at a Pâkayagña.
1	9	11	The highest is unlimited.
1	9	12	Thus Sudâs Paigavana, after having offered the sacrifice of a mess of cooked food to Indra and[paragraph continues] Agni, gave one hundred thousand (cows as the sacrificial fee).
1	9	13	Now if he should not be able to get for the morning or for the evening oblation, or for the sacrifices of the full or of the new moon at his (sacred) domestic fire, any substance fit for sacrifice or a person who could sacrifice (instead of himself, if he is prevented): what ought he to do?
1	9	14	Until the evening oblation the (time for the) morning oblation is not elapsed, nor the (time for the) evening oblation until the morning oblation. Until the new moon the (time for the) sacrifice of the full moon is not elapsed, nor the (time for the) sacrifice of the new moon until the full moon.
1	9	15	During that interval he should try to obtain sacrificial food or to find a sacrificer.
1	9	16	Or (if he does not succeed in this) he should cook fruits or leaves of trees or herbs which are sacrificially pure, and should sacrifice them.
1	9	17	Or he should at least sacrifice water; thus has said Pâkayagña, the son of Idâ. For (even if he offers only water) the sacrifice has been performed.
1	9	18	And there is an expiation for one who has not sacrificed.
1	9	19	And, (says Pâkayagña,) a Brâhmana should not omit to keep his vow.
1	9	20	Here they say also:
1	9	21	He should keep (his vow) during that time in which he does not sacrifice, by abstaining from food.
1	9	22	When he then has obtained (the necessary substances for sacrificing), he should make up for the (omitted) oblations.
1	9	23	For thus also his vow has been duly kept.
1	9	24	These rules (which have been given with regard to the sacrifices of the full and new moon) are valid for the Havis oblations which will be stated hereafter.
1	9	25	After the end of the Mantra follows the word Svâhâ.
1	9	26	At Âgya oblations he should only prepare that Âgya  and should sacrifice it, picking out portions of it. (He should) not (sacrifice) the two Âgya portions nor the Svishtakrit.
1	9	27	At Âgya oblations he should, if no special rule is given, sacrifice with the Mahâvyâhritis before and after (the chief ceremonies).
1	9	28	As at the wedding, thus at the tonsure (of the child's head), the initiation (of the Brahmakârin), and at the cutting of the beard.
1	9	29	At the end of the ceremony the Vâmadevya is sung for the sake of averting evil. The Vâmadevya is sung for the sake of averting evil.End of the First Prapâthaka.
2	1	1	Under a propitious Nakshatra let him take a wife—
2	1	2	Who should possess the auspicious characteristics in due way.
2	1	3	If he can find no such (woman, he should take) earth-clods—
2	1	4	From an altar, a furrow, a pool, a cow-stable, a place where four roads meet, a gambling-place, a place where corpses are burnt, and from sterile soil;
2	1	5	A ninth (earth-clod) mixed of all.
2	1	6	(These he should make) equal (and should) make marks at them.
2	1	7	Taking them in his hand he should offer them to the girl, and (reciting the formula): 'Right alone is the first; right nobody oversteps; on right this earth is founded. May N.N. become this universe!'—he should pronounce her name and should say: 'Take one of these.'
2	1	8	If she takes one of the first four (clods), he should marry her,
2	1	9	And according to some (teachers) also, if (she takes) the mixed one.
2	1	10	After she has been washed with Klîtaka, barley and beans, a friend should besprinkle her three times at her head, so that her whole body becomes wet, with Surâ of first quality, with (the formula), 'Kâma! I know thy name. Intoxication thou art by name,' &c. . (In the passage of the formula), 'Bring hither N.N.,' he should pronounce the husband's name. (The Mantras should have) the word Svâhâ at their end. With the two following verses he should wash her private parts.
2	1	11	That has to be done by (female) relatives (of the bride).
2	1	12	At the wedding wood has been put on the fire to the east of the house, on a surface besmeared (with cow-dung).
2	1	13	Then one of the people who assist at the wedding, fills a cup with 'firm' water, and having walked with the water-pot round the fire on its front side, silent, wrapped in his robe, he stations himself to the south (of the fire), facing the north
2	1	14	Another person with a goad (walks in the same way and stations himself in the same place).
2	1	15	They place roasted grain mixed with Samî leaves, to the amount of four handfuls, in a winnowing basket behind the fire,
2	1	16	And an upper mill-stone.
2	1	17	Now (the girl) whose hand he is going to seize, has been washed, (her whole body) including her head.
2	1	18	The husband should put on her a (new) garment which has not yet been washed, with the verse, 'They who spun' , and with (the verse), 'Put on her, dress her' .
2	1	19	Leading forward (from the house to the sacred fire, the bride) who is wrapped in her robe and wears the sacrificial cord over her left shoulder, he should murmur (the verse), 'Soma gave her to the Gandharva' .
2	1	20	While she, to the west of the fire, pushes forward with her foot a rush-mat or something else of that kind, veiled (with clothes), he should make her say: 'May the way which my husband goes, be open to me.'
2	1	21	If she does not murmur (these words out of shame, &c.), he should murmur (them, saying), 'To her' (instead of 'To me').
2	1	22	She should make the end of the rush-mat  reach the end of the Barhis.
2	1	23	On the east end of the rush-mat she sits down to the right of the bridegroom.
2	1	24	While she touches his right shoulder with her right hand, he sacrifices six oblations of Âgya with (the verse), 'May Agni go as the first,' and the following (verses) —
2	1	25	And (three oblations) with the Mahâvyâhritis, one by one;
2	1	26	A fourth with (the four Mahâvyâhritis) together.
2	2	1	After the sacrifice they both arise.
2	2	2	The husband passes behind her back, stations himself to the south, with his face turned to the north, and seizes the woman's joined hands.
2	2	3	(Standing) to the east (of the girl) her mother or her brother, having taken the roasted grain, should make the bride tread on the stone with the tip of her right foot.
2	2	4	The bridegroom murmurs: 'Tread on this stone' .
2	2	5	Her brother filling once his joined hands with roasted grain, pours it into the bride's joined hands.
2	2	6	After (Âgya) has been spread under and poured over (the fried grain), she sacrifices that in the fire without opening her joined hands, with (the verse which the bridegroom [?] recites), 'This woman says' .
2	2	7	(The verses), 'The god Aryaman,' and, 'Pûshan'[paragraph continues]  (are repeated) at the two following (oblations of fried grain).
2	2	8	After that sacrifice the husband, passing (behind her back), returns in the same way, and leads her round the fire so that their right sides are turned towards it, or a Brâhmana versed in the Mantras (does the same), with (the verse), 'The maid from the fathers' .
2	2	9	After she has thus been lead round, she stands as before , and treads (on the stone) as before , and he murmurs the (Mantra) as before , and (her brother) pours (the fried grain into her hands) as before , and she sacrifices as before .
2	2	10	In the same way three times.
2	2	11	After (she) has poured the remnants (of the fried grain) into the fire, they make (her) step forward in a north-easterly direction with (the formula), 'For sap with one step' .
2	2	12	She should put forward her right foot (first) and should follow with the left.
2	2	13	(The bridegroom) should say (to her), 'Do not put the left (foot) before the right.'
2	2	14	The lookers-on he should address with (the verse), 'Auspicious ornaments wears this woman' .
2	2	15	To the west of the fire the water-carrier follows (their way) and besprinkles the bridegroom on his forehead, and also the other one (i.e. the bride),with this verse (which the bridegroom murmurs), 'May (the Visve devâs) anoint (or, unite)' .
2	2	16	After she has been (thus) besprinkled, he puts up her joined hands with his left hand, seizes with his right hand her right hand with the thumb, her hand being turned with the palm upwards, and murmurs these six verses referring to the seizing of (a girl's) hand, 'I seize thy hand' .
2	2	17	When (these verses) are finished, they carry her away—
2	3	1	To a convenient house of a Brâhmana, which is situated in a north-easterly direction.
2	3	2	There wood has been put on the (nuptial) fire.
2	3	3	To the west of the fire a red bull's hide has been spread out, with the neck to the east and with the hair outside.
2	3	4	On that they make the woman, who has to keep silence, sit down.
2	3	5	And (there) she remains sitting until the stars appear.
2	3	6	When (somebody) has said that a star has appeared, (the husband) sacrifices six oblations of Âgya with the (six verses) commencing with (the verse), 'In the junctions of the lines' .
2	3	7	The remnants of each oblation he should pour out over the bride's head.
2	3	8	After the sacrifice they arise, go out (of the house), and he shows her the 'firm star' (i.e. the polar-star).
2	3	9	(Repeating the formula): 'Firm art thou. May I, N.N., become firm in the house of N.N., my husband'—she should pronounce her husband's and her own name.
2	3	10	And (he shows her besides the star) Arundhatî.
2	3	11	(She says): 'I (N.N.) am held fast,' &c., as above .
2	3	12	He then addresses her with the verse, 'Firm is the sky' .
2	3	13	After she has been addressed (thus), she respectfully calls her Guru by his Gotra name.
2	3	14	Thus she breaks her silence.
2	3	15	From that time through a period of three nights they should both avoid eating saline or pungent food, and should sleep together on the ground without having conjugal intercourse.
2	3	16	Here, they say, an Argha reception (should be offered to the young husband).
2	3	17	Some say (that this reception should be offered) when (the bridegroom and his companions) have arrived (at the house of the bride's father).
2	3	18	The first food which he eats, should be foodfit for sacrifice, over which he has murmured .
2	3	19	Or he should prepare on the following day a mess of cooked food, of which they eat together.
2	3	20	The deities to whom it belongs, are, Agni, Pragâpati, the Visve devâs, and Anumati.
2	3	21	Having taken that food out (of the vessel in which it is), and having spread it out, he should touch one part of it with his hand, with (the verses), 'With the tie of food, with the jewel' .
2	3	22	After he has eaten, and has given the rest to the wife, (they may do) what they like.
2	3	23	A cow is the sacrificial fee.
2	4	1	When she mounts the chariot, let him murmur the verse, 'Adorned with Kimsuka flowers, of Salmali wood' .
2	4	2	On the way he should address crossways, rivers and unevennesses (of the soil), big trees, and burial grounds, with (the verse), 'May no waylayers meet us' .
2	4	3	If the axle breaks, or something that is bound gets loose, or if the chariot is overturned, or if some other accident happens, they should put wood on the fire which they carry with themselves, shouldmake oblations (of Âgya) with the Vyâhritis, should procure a new piece (instead of that which has been damaged), and should besmear it with the remnants of the Âgya (that has been offered), with (the verse), 'He who without binding' .
2	4	4	Having sung the Vâmadevya, he should mount (again).
2	4	5	When they have arrived, the Vâmadevya (is sung).
2	4	6	When (the bride) has reached the house, Brâhmana women of good character, whose husbands and sons are living, make her descend (from the chariot), and make her sit down on a bull's hide with (the verse which the husband recites), 'Here, ye cows, bring forth calves' .
2	4	7	They should place a boy in her lap.
2	4	8	Into the joined hands of that (boy) they should throw lotus-roots (?),
2	4	9	Or fruits.
2	4	10	After she has made that boy rise, she sacrifices the eight 'firm' Âgya oblations with (the formula), 'Here is steadiness' .
2	4	11	When she has finished, she puts a piece of wood (on the fire) and respectfully salutes the Gurus, according to seniority, with their Gotra names. Then they may do what they like.
2	5	1	Now (follow) the ceremonies of the fourth day.
2	5	2	Having put wood on the fire, he four times sacrifices expiatory Âgya oblations with (the formula), 'Agni! Thou art expiation' —
2	5	3	(And with the same formula), putting instead of Agni, Vâyu, Kandra, and Sûrya;
2	5	4	A fifth oblation (with the names of the four gods) together, changing (in the Mantra the singular) into the plural.
2	5	5	The remnants of each oblation he should pour into a water-pot.
2	5	6	With that (Âgya) they besmear her body, including her hair and nails, remove (that water and Âgya by rubbing her), and wash her.
2	5	7	After three nights have passed, they should cohabit, according to some (teachers).
2	5	8	When she has had her monthly illness and the blood has ceased to flow, that is the time for cohabiting.
2	5	9	With his right hand he should touch her secret parts with the verse, 'May Vishnu make thy wombready' , and with that, 'Give conception, Sinîvâlî' .
2	5	10	When those two verses are finished, they cohabit.
2	6	1	The beginning of the third month of pregnancy is the time for the Pumsavana (i.e. the ceremony to secure the birth of a son).
2	6	2	In the morning, after she has been washed, sitting on northward-pointed Darbha grass, (all over her body) including her head, she sits down to the west of the fire on northward-pointed Darbha grass, facing the east.
2	6	3	Her husband, standing behind her, should grasp down with his right hand over her right shoulder, and should touch the uncovered place of her navel with the verse, 'The two men, Mitra and Varuna' .
2	6	4	Then they may do what they like.
2	6	5	Then afterwards (the following ceremony should be performed).
2	6	6	In a north-easterly direction, having bought for three times seven barley corns or beans a Nyagrodha shoot which. has fruits on both sides, which is not dry and not touched by worms, he should set that up.
2	6	7	(He buys it with the Mantras):'If thou belongest to Soma, I buy thee for the king Soma.'If thou belongest to Varuna, I buy thee for the king Varuna.'If thou belongest to the Vasus, I buy thee for the Vasus.'If thou belongest to the Rudras, I buy thee for the Rudras.'If thou belongest to the Âdityas, I buy thee for the Âdityas.'If thou belongest to the Maruts, I buy thee for the Maruts.'If thou belongest to the Visve devâs, I buy thee for the Visve devâs.'
2	6	8	He should set it up with (the Mantra), 'Ye herbs, being well-minded, bestow strength on this (shoot); for it will do its work.' Then he should put grass around it, should take it, and place it in the open air.
2	6	9	Having washed a nether mill-stone, a student or a (wife) addicted (to her husband), a person who is a Brâhmana by birth (only and not by learning), or a girl, pounds (that Nyagrodha shoot) without moving backward (the stone with which she pounds it).
2	6	10	In the morning, after she has been washed, sitting on northward-pointed Darbha grass, (all over her body), including her head, she lies down to the west of the fire on northward-pointed Darbha grass, with her head to the east.
2	6	11	Her husband, standing behind her, should seize (the pounded Nyagrodha shoot) with thethumb and the fourth finger of his right hand, and should insert it into her right nostril with the verse, 'A man is Agni, a man is Indra' .
2	6	12	Then they should do what they like.
2	7	1	Now (follows) the Sîmantakarana (or parting of the hair), in her first pregnancy,—
2	7	2	In the fourth, or sixth, or eighth month (of her pregnancy).
2	7	3	In the morning, after she has been washed, sitting on northward-pointed Darbha grass, (all over her body), including her head, she sits down to the west of the fire on northward-pointed Darbha grass, facing the east.
2	7	4	Her husband, standing behind her, ties (to her neck) an Udumbara branch with an even number of unripe fruits on it, with (the verse), 'Rich in sap is this tree' .
2	7	5	He then parts her hair upwards (i.e. beginning from the front), the first time with Darbha blades, with (the word), 'Bhûh!' the second time with (the word), 'Bhuvah!' the third time with (the word), 'Svah!'—
2	7	6	Then with (a splint of) Vîratara (wood) with this verse, 'With which Aditi's' ;
2	7	7	Then with a full spindle, with this verse, 'I invoke Râkâ'
2	7	8	And with a porcupine's quill that has three white spots, with (the verse), 'Which are thy blessings, O Râkâ' .
2	7	9	(There should be prepared) a mess of boiled rice with sesamum seeds, covered with ghee; at that he should make her look.
2	7	10	Let him say to her, 'What dost thou see?' and make her answer, 'Offspring!'
2	7	11	That (food) she should eat herself.
2	7	12	Brâhmana women should sit by her side, pronouncing auspicious words (such as), 'A mother of valiant sons! A mother of living sons! A living husband's wife!'
2	7	13	Now (follows) the sacrifice for the woman in labour.
2	7	14	When the child is appearing, he strews (Darbha grass) round the fire and sacrifices two Âgya oblations with this verse, 'She who athwart' , and with (the verse), 'Vipaskit has taken away' .
2	7	15	'A male he will be born, N.N. by name'—(in this passage of the last verse) he pronounces a name.
2	7	16	What that (name is), is kept secret.
2	7	17	When they announce to him that a son has been born, he should say, 'Delay still cutting off the navel-string and giving him the breast.'
2	7	18	Let him have rice and barley-grains pounded in the same way as the (Nyagrodha) shoot.
2	7	19	Seizing (that pounded substance) with the thumb and the fourth finger of his right hand, he smears it on the tongue of the boy, with the formula, 'This order' .
2	7	20	In the same way the production of intelligence (is performed). He should give to eat (to the child) clarified butter.
2	7	21	Or he takes it with gold (i.e. with a golden spoon) and sacrifices it on the face of the boy with this verse, 'May Mitra and Varuna bestow intelligence on thee' , and with (the verse), 'The lord of the seat, the wonderful' .
2	7	22	Let him say, 'Cut off the navel-string,' and, 'Give the breast (to the child).'
2	7	23	From that time let him not touch (his wife) until ten nights have passed.
2	8	1	On the third (Tithi) of the third bright fortnight after his birth, in the morning the father has the child washed, including his head, and after sunset, when the evening-red has disappeared, he worships (the moon), holding up his joined hands.
2	8	2	Then the mother, having dressed the son in a clean garment, hands him, from south to north, with his face turned to the north, to the father.
2	8	3	She then passes behind his back and stations herself to the north (of her husband).
2	8	4	He then murmurs (the three verses), 'Thy heart, O thou whose hair is well parted' , and after he has, with the words , 'That this son may not come to harm (and thus be torn) from his mother'—
2	8	5	Handed him, from south to north, to his mother, they may do what they like.
2	8	6	Then in the following bright fortnights (at the time) stated above (Sûtra I), the father, filling his joined hands with water and turning his face towards the moon, worships it—
2	8	7	Letting (the water) flow (out of his joined hands) once with the Yagus, 'What in the moon' , and twice silently. Then they may do what they like.
2	8	8	When ten nights have elapsed after (the child's) birth, or a hundred nights, or one year, the Nâmadheyakarana (or giving a name to the child, is performed).
2	8	9	He who is going to perform (that ceremony—the father or a representative of the father), sits down to the west of the fire on northward-pointed Darbha grass, facing the east.
2	8	10	Then the mother, having dressed the son in a clean garment, hands him, from south to north,with his face turned to the north, to the performer (of the ceremony).
2	8	11	She then passes behind his back and sits down to the north (of him), on northward-pointed Darbha grass.
2	8	12	He then sacrifices to Pragâpati, to the Tithi (of the child's birth), to the Nakshatra (of the child's birth), and to the (presiding) deity (of that Tithi and of that Nakshatra).
2	8	13	He then murmurs the Mantra, 'Who art thou? What person art thou?' , touching the sense-organs at (the boy's) head.
2	8	14	In (the passage of the Mantra), 'Enter upon the month, that belongs to Ahaspati (i.e. the lord of days), N.N.!' and at the end of the Mantra he should give him a name beginning with a sonant, with a semivowel in it, with a long vowel or the Visarga at the end, (and formed with) a Krit (suffix).
2	8	15	It should not contain a Taddhita (suffix).
2	8	16	(He should give a name with) an odd (number of syllables), ending in -dâ, to girls.
2	8	17	And after he has told the name to the mother first, they may do what they like.
2	8	18	A cow constitutes the sacrificial fee.
2	8	19	Every month (after the birth) of the boy, (or)after one year, or on the Parvan days of the year (i.e. on the last Tithi of each of the three seasons) he should sacrifice to Agni and Indra, to Heaven and Earth, and to the Visve devâs.
2	8	20	Having sacrificed to the deity (of the Tithi and of the Nakshatra respectively), he should sacrifice to the Tithi and to the Nakshatra.
2	8	21	When (the father) returns from a journey, or when (the son) begins to know, 'This is my father,' or when (the son) has been initiated, (the father) should grasp with his two hands his son round the head, and should murmur, 'From limb by limb thou art produced' .
2	8	22	With (the formula), 'With the cattle's himkâra I kiss thee'  he should kiss him. Then he may do what he likes.
2	8	23	In the same way (he should do) to his younger sons—
2	8	24	According to their age or in the order in which he meets them.
2	8	25	Girls he should silently kiss on their head; he should silently kiss them on their head.
2	9	1	Now follows the tonsure of the child's head, in the third year.
2	9	2	To the east of the house on a surface besmeared (with cow-dung) wood has been put on the fire.
2	9	3	There the following things have been placed:
2	9	4	To the south (of the fire) twenty-one Darbha blades, a brass vessel with hot water, a razor of Udumbara wood or a mirror, and a barber with a razor in his hand;
2	9	5	To the north, bull's dung and a mess of boiled rice with sesamum seeds which may be more or less cooked.
2	9	6	Let them fill vessels separately with rice and barley, with sesamum seeds and beans, and let them place (those vessels) to the east (of the fire).
2	9	7	The boiled rice with sesamum seeds  and all seeds  are given to the barber.
2	9	8	Then the mother, having dressed the son in a clean garment, sits down to the west of the fire on northward-pointed Darbha grass, facing the east.
2	9	9	To the west (of her), facing the east, the person stations himself who is going to perform that (ceremony).
2	9	10	He then murmurs, fixing his thoughts on Savitri, looking at the barber, (the Mantra), 'Hither has come Savitri with his razor' .
2	9	11	And fixing his thoughts on Vâyu, looking at the brass vessel with warm water, (he murmurs the Mantra), 'With warm water, O Vâyu, come hither' .
2	9	12	Drawing water (out of that vessel) with his right hand he moistens the patch of hair on the right side (of the boy's head) with (the Mantra), 'May the waters moisten thee for life' .
2	9	13	With (the Mantra), 'Vishnu's tusk art thou'  he looks at the razor of Udumbara wood or at the mirror.
2	9	14	With (tile Mantra), 'Herb! Protect him!'  he puts seven Darbha blades, with their points turned towards (the boy's) head, into the patch of hair on the right side of his head.
2	9	15	Pressing them down with his left hand, and seizing with his right hand the razor of Udumbara wood or the mirror, he touches with it (the Darbha blades), with the (Mantra), 'Axe! Do no harm to him!' .
2	9	16	With (the Mantra), 'With which Pûshan has shaven Brihaspati's head' , he moves forward (that razor or the mirror) three times towards the east without cutting (the hair); once with the Yagus, twice silently.
2	9	17	Then (the barber) with the razor of metal cuts the hair and throws (the cut off hair ends) on the bull's dung.
2	9	18	In the same way (after the same rites have been performed), he cuts the patch of hair on the back-side;
2	9	19	And that on the left side.
2	9	20	He should repeat (when going to cut the hair on the back-side, and then again on the left side, the rites stated above), beginning from the moistening of the hair .
2	9	21	Grasping with his two hands (the boy) round his head he should murmur (the verse), 'The threefold age of Gamadagni' .
2	9	22	In the same way (the rites are performed) for a girl,
2	9	23	(But) silently.
2	9	24	The sacrifice, however, (is performed) with the Mantra.
2	9	25	Walking away from the fire in a northerly direction they have the arrangement of (the boy's) hair made according to the custom of his Gotra and of his family.
2	9	26	They throw the hair on the bull's dung (mentioned above), take it to the forest, and bury it.
2	9	27	Some throw them on a bunch (of grass or the like).
2	9	28	Then they may do what they like.
2	9	29	A cow constitutes the sacrificial fee.
2	10	1	In the eighth year after the conception let him initiate a Brâhmana,
2	10	2	In the eleventh year after the conception a Kshatriya,
2	10	3	In the twelfth year after the conception a Vaisya.
2	10	4	Until the sixteenth year the time has not passed for a Brâhmana, until the twenty-second for a Kshatriya, until the twenty-fourth for a Vaisya.
2	10	5	After that (time has passed), they become patitasâvitrîka (i.e. they have lost their right of being taught the Sâvitrî).
2	10	6	Let them not initiate such men, nor teach them, nor perform sacrifices for them, nor form matrimonial alliances with them.
2	10	7	On the day on which the youth is going to receive the initiation, on that day, early in the morning, they give him to eat, and have his hair arranged, and wash him, and deck him with ornaments, and put on him a (new) garment which has not yet been washed.
2	10	8	Their garments are made of linen, of hempen cloth, of cotton, or of wool (according to the caste to which the student belongs).
2	10	9	The skins (which they wear), are an antelope-skin, or the skin of a spotted deer, or a goat's skin.
2	10	10	Their girdles are made of Muñga grass, of Kâsa grass, of Tâmbala.
2	10	11	Their staffs are of Parna wood, of Bilva wood, of Asvattha wood.
2	10	12	The garment of a Brâhmana is made of linen, or of hempen cloth, that of a Kshatriya, of cotton, that of a Vaisya, of wool.
2	10	13	Thereby also the other articles have been explained.
2	10	14	Or if (the proper articles prescribed) cannot be got, all (of them may be used) by (persons of) all castes.
2	10	15	To the east of the house on a surface besmeared (with cow-dung) wood has been put on the fire.
2	10	16	Having sacrificed with (the Mantras which the student recites) 'Agni! Lord of the vow' , the teacher stations himself to the westof the fire, on northward-pointed Darbha grass, facing the east.
2	10	17	Between the fire and the teacher the student (stands), raising his joined hands, turning his face towards the teacher, on northward-pointed Darbha grass.
2	10	18	Standing on his south side a Brâhmana versed in the Mantras fills (the student's) joined hands with water,
2	10	19	And afterwards (those) of the teacher.
2	10	20	Looking (at the student the teacher) murmurs (the verse), 'With him who comes to us, we have come together' .
2	10	21	He causes (the student) to say, 'I have come hither to studentship' .
2	10	22	In (the words), 'What is thy name' , he asks after his name.
2	10	23	The teacher chooses for him a name which he is to use at respectful salutations,
2	10	24	(A name) derived from (the name of) a deity or a Nakshatra,
2	10	25	Or also of his Gotra, according to some (teachers).
2	10	26	Having let the water run out of his joinedhands (over the student's hands), the teacher with his right hand seizes (the student's) right hand together with the thumb, with (the formula), 'By the impulse of the god Savitri, with the arms of the two Asvins, with Pûshan's hands I seize thy hand, N.N.!' .
2	10	27	He then makes him turn round from left to right with (the formula), 'Move in the sun's course after him, N.N.!' .
2	10	28	Grasping down with his right hand over his right shoulder he should touch his uncovered navel with (the formula), 'Thou art the knot of all breath' .
2	10	29	Raising himself  the place near the navel with (the formula), 'Ahura' .
2	10	30	Raising himself (still more, he should touch) the place of the heart with (the formula), 'Krisana' .
2	10	31	Having touched from behind with his right hand (the student's) right shoulder with (the formula), 'I give thee in charge to Pragâpati, N.N.!' —
2	10	32	And with his left (hand) the left (shoulder) with (the formula), 'I give thee in charge to the god Savitri, N.N.!' —
2	10	33	He then directs him (to observe the duties of Brahmakarya, by the formula), 'A student art thou, N.N.!' .
2	10	34	'Put on fuel. Eat water. Do the service. Do not sleep in the day-time' .
2	10	35	Having gone in a northerly direction fromthe fire, the teacher sits down to the east, on northward-pointed Darbha grass,
2	10	36	The student to the west, bending his right knee, turning his face towards the teacher, also on northward-pointed Darbha grass.
2	10	37	(The teacher) then ties round (the student) thrice from left to right the girdle made of Muñga grass and causes him to repeat (the verse), 'Protecting us from evil word' , and (the verse), 'The protectress of right' .
2	10	38	Then (the student) respectfully sits down near (the teacher) with (the words), 'Recite, sir! May the reverend one recite the Sâvitrî to me.'
2	10	39	He then recites  to him, Pâda by Pâda, hemistich by hemistich, and the whole verse,
2	10	40	And the Mahâvyâhritis one by one, with the word Om at the end .
2	10	41	And handing over to him the staff, which should be made of (the wood of) a tree, he causes him to repeat (the formula), 'O glorious one, make me glorious' .
2	10	42	Then (the student) goes to beg food,
2	10	43	First of his mother, and of two other women friends, or of as many as there are in the neighbourhood.
2	10	44	He announces the alms (received) to his teacher.
2	10	45	The rest of the day he stands silently.
2	10	46	After sunset he puts a piece of wood on the fire with (the Mantra), 'To Agni I have brought a piece of wood' .
2	10	47	Through a period of three nights he avoids eating pungent or saline food.
2	10	48	At the end of that (period) a mess of boiled rice-grains (is offered) to Savitri.
2	10	49	Then he may do what he likes.
2	10	50	A cow constitutes the sacrificial fee.End of the Second Prapâthaka.
3	1	1	Now (follows) the Godâna ceremony (or cutting of the beard), in the sixteenth year.
3	1	2	The cutting of the hair (and the beard) has been explained by the (description of the) Kûdâkarana .
3	1	3	The student has his hair (and beard) cut himself.
3	1	4	He has all the hair of his body shaven.
3	1	5	The sacrificial fee given by a Brâhmana consists of an ox and a cow,
3	1	6	That given by a Kshatriya, of a pair of horses,
3	1	7	That given by a Vaisya, of a pair of sheep.
3	1	8	Or a cow (is given by persons) of all (castes).
3	1	9	A goat (is given) to the person who catches up the hair.
3	1	10	The Upanayana .(connected with the Godânavrata and the other Vratas) has been declared by the Upanayana .
3	1	11	(The use of) a garment, however, which has not yet been washed, is not required (here),
3	1	12	Nor the adornment.
3	1	13	(One should) not initiate one who does not intend to keep the vow through one year.
3	1	14	Handing over to him (i.e. to the student) a staff, which should be made of (the wood of) a tree, he directs him (to observe the duties connected with his vow, in the following words):
3	1	15	'Obey thy teacher, except in sinful conduct.

3	1	29	Touching water in the evening and in the morning (is prescribed) for these (Vratas).
3	1	30	The Âditya-vrata, however, some do not undergo.
3	1	31	They who undergo it, wear one garment.
3	1	32	They allow nothing to be between (themselves and) the sun, except trees and (the roofs of) houses.
3	1	33	They do not descend into water deeper than knee-deep, except on the injunction of their teacher.
3	2	1	For the Mahânâmnî verses (the Vrata is to be kept) twelve years,
3	2	2	(Or) nine, six, three (years).
3	2	3	These are the various possibilities.
3	2	4	Or also one year, according to some (teachers).
3	2	5	(In this case), however, the observances are enhanced.
3	2	6	(Keeping the Vrata through one year is allowed only) if (the student's) ancestors have learnt the Mahânâmnî verses.
3	2	7	There is also a Brâhmana of the Rauruki (Sâkhâ, in which it is said):
3	2	8	'The mothers forsooth say to their sons, when they suckle them:
3	2	9	'"Become men, my little sons, who endeavour to accomplish the Sakvarî-vrata!"'

3	2	25	Let him not ascend a ship.
3	2	26	If his life is in danger, however, he may ascend (a ship), after having touched water.
3	2	27	In the same way (he should touch water) having disembarked.
3	2	28	For in water the virtue of the Mahânâmnîs is contained.
3	2	29	If he practises these duties, (the god) Parganya will send rain according to his wish.
3	2	30	The rules about dark (clothes), standing, sitting, (making) way, and (dark) food may be considered as optional.

3	2	32	In the same way the two other Stotriya verses (after two-thirds of the time and at the end of the whole time).

3	2	40	Fire, Âgya, the sun, a Brahman, a bull, food, water, curds,
3	2	41	With (the words), 'The sky have I beheld! Light have I beheld!'
3	2	42	In that way all  three times.
3	2	43	After the ceremony for averting evil has been performed, the student respectfully salutes the teacher.
3	2	44	Thus he has to break the silence (enjoined upon him).
3	2	45	A bull, a brass vessel, a garment, an optional gift (of a cow): this is the sacrificial fee.
3	2	46	The first time he may choose (either a bull or a brass vessel).

3	2	52	After (the student) has returned (from the forest), he should entertain his teacher and his retinue with food,
3	2	53	And his fellow-students who have come together.
3	2	54	The way to sing the Gyeshthasâmans has been explained by (the statements given with regard to) the Mahânâmnî-(vrata).

3	3	2	After (the teacher) has sacrificed with the Vyâhritis, he recites the Sâvitrî to the students as at the Upanayana;
3	3	3	And (he chants) the Sâvitrî with its Sâman melody,
3	3	4	And (the Bârhaspatya Sâman, with the text), 'Soma, the king, Varuna' .

3	3	26	Three days, if his teacher (has died);
3	3	27	One day and one night, if somebody (has died) who has reverentially approached.
3	3	28	If singing, or the sound of a musical instrument, or weeping is heard, or if it is storming, (thestudy of the Veda is discontinued) as long as that (reason of the interruption) lasts.

3	6	3	If he is desirous of thriving (in his cattle), he should lick with his tongue the forehead of the firstborn calf, before it is licked by its mother, and should gulp with (the formula), 'Thou art the phlegm of the cows' .

3	6	9	(The rites at) the driving out (of the cows), at the coming back (of the cows), and at the setting into motion of the rope (with the calves).
3	6	10	At the cow-sacrifice (i.e. the sacrifice by which a thriving condition for the cows is obtained), boiled rice-grains with milk (are offered).
3	6	11	Let him sacrifice to Agni, Pûshan, Indra, and Îsvara.
3	6	12	To the bull honour is done (by adorning it, by lavish food, &c.).
3	6	13	By the cow-sacrifice also the horse-sacrifice (i.e. the sacrifice by which thriving horses are obtained) has been explained.
3	6	14	Of deities Yama and Varuna are added here (to the deities stated above) (Sûtra II).
3	6	15	(After the cow-sacrifice) the cows are besprinkled with scented water; the cows are besprinkled with scented water.

3	7	2	It has to be performed on the full-moon day (of the month Srâvana).
3	7	3	Having besmeared (a surface) to the east of the house (with cow-dung), they carry forward (to that place) fire taken from the (sacred) domestic fire.
3	7	4	He besmears four spots to the four sides (of the fire),

3	7	7	He puts a dish on the fire and fries (in thatdish) one handful of barley-grains, without burning them.
3	7	8	To the west of the fire he places a mortar so that it stands firmly, and husks (the grains), separating (the husked and the unhusked grains?).
3	7	9	After he has carefully ground them to flour, and has thrown (that) into a wooden cup (kamasa), and covered it with a winnowing-basket, he puts it up (in the house).
3	7	10	Between (the besmeared surface) towards the south, and that towards the east (there should be) a passage.
3	7	11	After sunset he takes the wooden cup, (the spoon called) Darvi, and the winnowing-basket, and goes to (the fire) which has been carried forward .
3	7	12	He throws the flour into the winnowing-basket and fills the wooden cup with water.
3	7	13	He takes once a quantity of flour with the Darvi spoon, pours out water on the besmeared place to the east (of the fire), and offers (there) a Bali with (the words), 'O king of Serpents, dwelling towards the east, this is thy Bali!' .
3	7	14	He pours the rest of the water over (that Bali, taking care) that it does not carry away the Bali.
3	7	15	Turning round from right to left, he besprinkles the wooden cup and the Darvi spoon, warms them, and (repeats the offering of a Bali) in the same way towards the south, towards the west, and towards the north, as the Mantra  runs, without turning away (between the single Bali-offerings).
3	7	16	After he has thrown the remnants (of flour) out of the basket into the fire, he goes to that fire which has not been carried forward.
3	7	17	To the west of that fire he touches the earth with his two hands turned downwards, and murmurs the Mantra, 'Adoration to the Earth’s'—.
3	7	18	In the evening boiled rice-grains with milk (are prepared).
3	7	19	Of that (milk-rice) he should make oblations with (the formulas), 'To Sravana, to Vishnu, to Agni, to Pragâpati, to the Visve devâs Svâhâ!'

4	5	9	When undertaking ceremonies for the obtainment of special wishes, let him fast during three (days and) nights,
4	5	10	Or (let him omit) three meals.
4	5	11	At such ceremonies, however, as are repeated regularly, (let him do so only) before their first performance.
4	5	12	He should (simply) fast, however, before such ceremonies as are performed on sacrificial days (i.e. on the first day of the fortnight).
4	5	13	(At a ceremony) which ought to be performed immediately (after the occurrence by which it has been caused), the consecration follows after (the ceremony itself).
4	5	14	Let him recite the Prapada formula , sitting in the forest on Darbha grass,

4	5	25	Or, if he is not able (to do so, he may drink) once a day rice-water,
4	5	26	In which he can see his image.
4	5	27	This observance (forms part) of (all) fortnightly observances.
4	5	28	He then should in the full-moon night plunge up to his navel into a pool which does not dry up, and should sacrifice at the end of (each of those five) verses fried grains with his mouth into the water, with the word Svâhâ.
4	5	29	Now (follows) another (ceremony with the same five verses).
4	5	30	With the first (verse) one who is desirous of the enjoyment (of riches), should worship the sun, within sight of (that) person rich in wealth (fromwhom he hopes to obtain wealth); then he will obtain wealth.

4	6	4	It is performed on the sacrificial day (i.e. on the first day of the fortnight).
4	6	5	(Oblations are made with the six verses), 'From the head' , verse by verse.
4	6	6	The seventh (verse is), 'She who athwart' .
4	6	7	(Then follow) the verses of the Vâmadevya,
4	6	8	(And) the Mahâvyâhritis.
4	6	9	The last (verse) is, 'Pragâpati' .
4	6	10	With the formula, 'I am glory'  one who is desirous of glory should worship the sun in the forenoon, at noon, and in the afternoon,
4	6	11	Changing (the words), 'of the forenoon' (into 'of the noon,' and 'of the afternoon,' accordingly).

4	7	23	'One should say that an Asvattha brings (to the house) danger from fire; one should say that a Plaksha tree brings early death (to the inhabitants of the house), that a Nyagrodha brings oppression through (hostile) arms, that an Udumbara brings diseases of the eye.

4	8	5	Returning (to the fire) without looking back, he should, together with the persons belonging to hisfamily, as far as they have been initiated (by the Upanayana), eat the fried grains.
4	8	6	(This ceremony) procures happiness.
