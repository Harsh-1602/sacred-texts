1	1	Preface	The normal performance of the Agnyâdhâna, as that of the full and new-moon offerings, requires two days; the first of which is taken up with preliminary rites, while the second--that is, the first day of the respective half-moon--is devoted to the chief ceremonies, beginning with the production of the sacred fire by friction. After the sacrificer has chosen his four officiating priests--viz. the Brahman, Hotri, Adhvaryu, and Âgnîdhra (or Agnîdh)--he proceeds, together with them, to erect the two sheds or 'firehouses.' In order to determine their exact sites, the Adhvaryu first draws from west to east the so-called 'easterly' line , and on it marks,prakramas or steps from each other, the centres of the Gârhapatya and Âhavanîya fire-places, the outlines of which he then traces, making each a square aratni or cubit in area, the former circular, the latter square. The DakshinâgniThe Adhvaryu then procures a temporary fire,--either producing it by friction, or obtaining it from certain specified sources in the village,--and after the usual fivefold lustration of the Gârhapatya fire-place (cf. ), he lays down the fire thereon. Towards sunset the sacrificer [while seated east of the Âhavanîya house] invokes the gods and manes with 'Gods, fathers! fathers, gods! I sacrifice, being who I am; neither will I exclude him whose I am: mine own shall be the offering, mine own the toiling, mine own the sacrifice!' He then enters the Âhavanîya house from the east, passes through it to the Gârhapatya, and sits down behind (west of) the fire; his wife at the same time entering the Gârhapatya house from the south and seating herself south of him,--both facing the east. Thereupon the Adhvaryu hands to the sacrificer two pieces of wood (arani),--if possible, of asvattha, grown out of a samî tree,--to be used next morning for the production (or 'churning') of the sacred fire by one of them (the upper arani) being rapidly drilled in a hole in the other (or lower arani). [The sacrificer and his wife then lay the upper and lower sticks respectively on their laps; whereupon certain propitiatory ceremonies are performed by them, and honours are paid to the priests and the sticks; and the latter are finally deposited on a seat.] In the house of the Gârhapatya a he-goat may then be tied up for the night, which, if it belong to the sacrificer, is to be presented by him to the Âgnîdhra on the completion of the sacrifice.After sunset the Adhvaryu measures out four vessels of husked rice grains--each containing three handfuls, which quantity is considered sufficient to furnish a meal for one man--on an ox-hide died red [and spread out with the hairy side upwards and the neck-part to the east]. With this rice the (odana) kâtushprâsya, or '(pap) to be eaten by the four (priests),' is prepared on the provisional Gârhapatya fire. When it is ready, the Adhvaryu makes a hollow in the pap and pours clarified butter into it. He then takesDuring the night the sacrificer and his wife have to remain awake and keep up the fire. When the night clears up, the Adhvaryu extinguishes the fire, or, if there is to be a Dakshinâgni, he takes it southwards and keeps it in a safe place till that fire is made up. He then draws with the wooden sword three lines across the fire-place and proceeds with the preparation of the hearth-mounds in the way set forth in the first Brâhmana of this Book.
1	1	1	Now when he equips (Agni, the fire) from this and that quarter, that is the equipping (of the fire) with its equipments . In whatever (objects) some of (the nature of) Agni is inherent, therewith he equips (the fire); and in thus equipping it he supplies it partly with splendour, partly with cattle, partly with a mate.
1	1	2	In the first place he (the Adhvaryu) draws (three) lines (with the wooden sword on the Gârhapatya fire-place ). Whatever part of this earthis either trodden or spit upon, that he thereby removes from it; and he thus establishes his fire on earth that is entirely proper for the sacrifice: this is why he draws lines (across the fire-place).
1	1	3	He then sprinkles (the lines) with water. When he thus sprinkles (the fire-place) with water, that is the equipment (of the fire) with water. The reason why he brings water is that water is food; for water is indeed food: hence when water comes to this world, food is produced here. Thus he thereby supplies it (the fire) with food.
1	1	4	Water (ap, fem.), moreover, is female, and fire (agni, masc.) is male; so that he thereby supplies the latter with a productive mate. And since all this (universe) is pervaded (or obtained, âpta) by water, he sets up the fire, after he has obtained it by means of water . This is why he brings water.
1	1	5	He then brings (a piece of) gold. Now Agni at one time cast his eyes on the waters : 'May I pair with them,' he thought. He came together with them; and his seed became gold . For this reason the latter shines like fire, it being Agni'sseed. Hence it (gold) is found in water, for he (Agni) poured it into the water. Hence also one does not cleanse oneself with it , nor does one do anything else with it. Now there is splendour (for the fire): for he thereby makes it to be possessed of divine seed, bestows splendour on it; and sets up a fire completely endowed with seed. That is why he brings gold.
1	1	6	He then brings salt. Yonder sky assuredly bestowed that (salt as) cattle on this earth: hence they say that salt soil is suitable for cattle. That (salt), therefore, means cattle; and thus he thereby visibly supplies it (the fire) with cattle; and the latter having come from yonder (sky) is securely established on this earth. Moreover, that (salt) is believed to be the savour (rasa) of those two, the sky and the earth : so that he thereby supplies it (the fire) with the savour of those two, the sky and the earth. That is why he brings salt.
1	1	7	He then brings (the earth of) a mole-hill (âkhu-karîsha) . The moles certainly know thesavour of this earth: hence, by entering deeper and deeper into this earth, they (grow) very fat, knowing, as they do, its savour; and wherever they know the savour of this earth to be, there they cast it up. Hence he thereby supplies it (the fire) with the savour of this earth: that is why he brings a molehill. Moreover, they say of one who has attained prosperity (or splendour, sri) that he is purîshya; and purîsha and karîsha  doubtless mean one and the same thing: it is, therefore, for his (Agni's or the sacrificer's) attainment of splendour (sri) that he brings a mole-hill.
1	1	8	He then brings pebbles. Now the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pragâpati, once contended for superiority. This earth was then trembling like a lotus-leaf; for the wind was tossing it hither and thither: now it came near the gods, now it came near the Asuras. When it came near the gods,--
1	1	9	They said, 'Come, let us steady this resting-place; and when firm and steady, let us set upthe two fires on it; whereupon we will exclude our enemies from any share in it.'
1	1	10	Accordingly, in like manner as one would stretch a skin by means of wooden pins, they fastened down this resting-place; and it formed a firm and steady resting-place. And when it was firm and steady, they set up the two fires on it; and thereupon they excluded their enemies from any share in it .
1	1	11	And in like manner that one (the Adhvaryu) now fastens down that resting-place by means of pebbles; and on it, when firm and steady, he sets up the two fires; whereupon he excludes the (sacrificer's) enemies from any share in it. This is the reason why he brings pebbles.
1	1	12	These then are the five equipments : for fivefold is the sacrifice, fivefold the animal victim; and five seasons there are in the year.
1	1	13	Now, as to this, they say, 'Six seasons there are in the year.' And in that case the very deficiency (nyûna) itself is rendered a productive union , since it is from the lower part (nyûna, i.e. of the body) that offspring is here brought forth. Thus also a progressive improvement  (is assured to the sacrificer): for this reason there are five equipments. And when (it is nevertheless insisted on that) there are six seasons in the year, then Agni is the sixth of them, and thus there is no deficiency.
1	1	14	Here also they say, 'He should not equip it even with a single equipment!' For (they argue) all those (objects) are on this earth, and hence, when he establishes the fire on this earth, the latter of itself obtains all those equipments: he need not, therefore, equip it with a single equipment. But let him nevertheless bring (those objects) together; for when he establishes the fire on this (earth), then it obtains all the equipments: and what (benefit) accrues from the equipments being brought together, that also accrues to it . Let him for that reason bring (the objects) together.
1	2	1	He may set up the two fires  under the Krittikâs; for they, the Krittikâs, are doubtless Agni's asterism, so that if he sets up his fires under Agni's asterism, (he will bring about) a correspondence (between his fires and the asterism): for this reason he may set up his fires under the Krittikâs.
1	2	2	Moreover, the other lunar asterisms (consist of) one, two, three or four (stars), so that the Krittikâs are the most numerous (of asterisms) : hence he thereby obtains an abundance. For this reason he may set up his fires under the Krittikâs.
1	2	3	And again, they do not move away from the eastern quarter, whilst the other asterisms do move from the eastern quarter. Thus his (two fires) are established in the eastern quarter: for this reason he may set up his fires under the Krittikâs.
1	2	4	On the other hand (it is argued) why he should not set up the fires under the Krittikâs. Originally, namely, the latter were the wives of the Bears (riksha); for the seven Rishis  were in former timescalled the Rikshas (bears). They were, however, precluded from intercourse (with their husbands), for the latter, the seven Rishis, rise in the north, and they (the Krittikâs) in the east. Now it is a misfortune for one to be precluded from intercourse (with his wife): he should therefore not set up his fires under the Krittikâs, lest he should thereby be precluded from intercourse.
1	2	5	But he may nevertheless set up (his fire under the Krittikâs); for Agni doubtless is their mate, and it is with Agni that they have intercourse: for this reason he may set up (the fire under the Krittikâs).
1	2	6	He may also set up his fires under (the asterism of Rohinî. For under Rohinî it was that Pragâpati, when desirous of progeny (or creatures), set up his fires. He created beings, and the creatures produced by him remained invariable and constant , like (red) cows (rohinî): hence the cow-like nature of Rohinî. Rich in cattle and offspring therefore he becomes whosoever, knowing this, sets up his fires under Rohinî.
1	2	7	Under Rohinî, indeed, the cattle set up their fires, thinking that they might attain to (ruh) the desire (or love) of men. They did attain to thedesire of men; and whatever desire the cattle then obtained in regard to men, that same desire he obtains, in regard to cattle, whosoever, knowing this, sets up his fire under Rohinî.
1	2	8	He may also set up his fires under (the asterism of) Mrigasîrsha. For Mrigasîrsha, indeed, is the head of Pragâpati ; and the head (siras) means excellence (srî), for the head does indeed mean excellence: hence they say of him who is the most excellent (sreshtha) of a community, that he is the head of that community. Excellence therefore he attains whosoever, knowing this, sets up his fire under Mrigasîrsha.
1	2	9	On the other hand (it is argued) why one should not set up his fire under Mrigasîrsha . The latter, indeed, is Pragâpati's body. Now, when they (the gods) on that occasion pierced him  with what is called 'the three-knotted arrow,' he abandoned thatbody, for the body is a mere relic (or dwelling, vâstu), unholy and sapless. He should therefore not set up his fires under Mrigasîrsha.
1	2	10	But he may, nevertheless, set them up (under Mrigasîrsha). For, assuredly, the body of that god, Pragâpati, is neither a relic nor unholy, : he may therefore set up (his fires under Mrigasîrsha). 'Under the Punarvasû he should perform the Punarâdheya ,' thus (it is prescribed).
1	2	11	He may also set up his fires under the Phalgunîs. They, the Phalgunîs, are Indra's asterism , and even correspond to him in name; for indeed Indra is also called Arguna, this being his mystic name; and they (the Phalgunîs) are also called Argunîs. Hence he overtly calls them Phalgunîs, for who dares to use his (the god's) mystic name? Moreover, the sacrificer himself is Indra, so that he in that case sets up his fires under his own asterism. Indra is the deity of the sacrifice; and accordingly his Agnyâdheya is thereby broughtinto relation with Indra. He may set up the fires under the first (Pûrva-phalgunîs)--whereby an advancing (successful) sacrifice accrues to him; or he may set them up under the second (Uttara-phalgunîs)--whereby a progressive (uttarâvat) improvement accrues to him.
1	2	12	Let him set up his fires under the asterism Hasta , whosoever should wish that (presents) should be offered him: then indeed (that will take place) forthwith; for whatever is offered with the hand (hasta), that indeed is given to him.
1	2	13	He may also set up his fires under Kitrâ. Now the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pragâpati, were contending for superiority. Both parties were desirous of rising to yonder world, the sky. The Asuras then constructed the fire (altar) called rauhina (fit to ascend by), thinking, 'Thereby we shall ascend (â-ruh) to the sky .'
1	2	14	Indra then considered , 'If they construct that (fire-altar), they will certainly prevail over us.' He secured a brick and proceeded thither, passing himself off for a Brâhman.
1	2	15	'Hark ye!' he said, 'I, too, will put on this (brick) for myself!' 'Very well,' they replied. He put it on. That fire (altar) of theirs wanted but very little to be completely built up,--
1	2	16	When he said, 'I shall take back this (brick) which belongs to me.' He took hold of it and pulled it out; and on its being pulled out, the fire-altar fell down; and along with the falling fire-altar the Asuras fell down. He then converted those bricks into thunderbolts and clove the (Asuras') necks.
1	2	17	Thereupon the gods assembled and said, 'Wonderfully (kitram) indeed it has fared with us who have slain so many enemies!' Hence the wonderful nature (kitrâtva)  of the asterism[paragraph continues] Kitrâ; and verily wonderfully it fares with him, and he slays his rivals, his spiteful enemy, whosoever, knowing this, sets up his fires under Kitrâ. A Kshatriya, therefore, should especially desire to take advantage of this asterism; since such a one is anxious to strike, to vanquish his enemies.
1	2	18	Originally these (nakshatras) were so many different powers (kshatra), just as that sun yonder. But as soon as he rose, he took from them (â-dâ) their energy, their power; therefore he (the sun) is called Âditya, because he took from them their energy, their power .
1	2	19	The gods then said, 'They who have been powers, shall no longer (na) be powers (kshatra) !' Hence the powerlessness (na-kshatratvam) of the nakshatras. For this reason also one need only take the sun for one's nakshatra (star), since he took away from them their energy, their power. But if he (the sacrificer) should nevertheless be desirous of having a nakshatra (under which to set up his fires), then assuredly that sun is a faultless nakshatra for him; and through that auspicious day (marked by the rising and setting of the sun) he should endeavour to obtain the benefits of whichever of those asterisms he might desire. Let him therefore take the sun alone for his nakshatra .
1	3	1	The spring, the summer, and the rains, these seasons (represent) the gods; and the autumn, the winter, and the dewy season represent the fathers. That half-moon which increases represents the gods, and that which decreases represents the fathers. The day represents the gods, and the night represents the fathers. And, further, the forenoon represents the gods, and the afternoon the fathers.
1	3	2	Those seasons, then, are the gods and the fathers; and whosoever, knowing this, invokes them as the gods and fathers, with his invocation of the gods the gods comply, and with his invocation of the fathers the fathers comply. Him the gods favour at his invocation of the gods, and him the fathers favour at his invocation of the fathers, whosoever, knowing this, invokes (the seasons) as the gods and fathers.
1	3	3	Now when he (the sun) moves northwards, then he is among the gods, then he guards the gods; and when he moves southwards, then he is among the fathers, then he guards the fathers .
1	3	4	When he (the sun) moves northwards, then one may set up his fires;--the gods have the evil dispelledfrom them (by the sun): he (the sacrificer) therefore dispels the evil from himself;--the gods are immortal: he therefore, though there is for him no prospect of immortality, attains the (full measure of) life, whosoever sets up his fires during that time. Whosoever, on the other hand, sets up his fires when (the sun) moves southwards, he does not dispel the evil from him,--since the fathers have not the evil dispelled from them (by the sun). The fathers are mortal: hence he dies before (he has attained the full measure of) life, whosoever sets up his fires during that time.
1	3	5	The spring is the priesthood, the summer the nobility, and the rainy season the common people (vis): a Brâhman therefore should set up his fires in spring, since the spring is the priesthood; and a Kshatriya should set them up in summer, since the summer is the nobility; and a Vaisya should set them up in the rainy season, since the rainy season is the common people.
1	3	6	And whosoever  desires to become endowed with holy lustre (brahmavarkasin), let him set up his fires in spring,--for the spring is the priesthood,--and he will certainly become endowed with holy lustre.
1	3	7	And whosoever desires to become a power (kshatra)  in prosperity and renown, let him set up his fires in summer,--for the summer is the nobility (kshatra),--and he will certainly become a power in prosperity and renown.
1	3	8	And whosoever may desire to be rich in progenyand cattle, let him set up his fires in the rainy season ,--for the rainy season is the common people, and the people means food,--and he certainly becomes rich in progeny and cattle, whosoever, knowing this, sets up his fires in the rainy season.
1	3	9	[In the opinion of others] both these (classes of) seasons have the evil dispelled from them, for the sun is the dispeller of their evil, and as soon as he rises he dispels the evil from both these (classes of seasons). He should therefore set up his fires at any time, when he feels called upon to sacrifice; and should not put it off from one day to the morrow: for who knows the morrow of man ?
1	4	1	On the day preceding his Agnyâdheya, he (the sacrificer with his wife) should take his food in the day-time. For the gods know the minds of man: they are, therefore, aware that his Agnyâdheya is to take place on the morrow; and all the gods betake themselves to his house and stay (upa-vas) in his house; whence this day is called upavasatha (fast-day) .
1	4	2	Now, as it would be unbecoming for him to take food before men (who are staying with him as his guests) have eaten; how much more would it be so, if he were to take food before the gods have eaten: let him therefore take his food in the day-time. However, he may also, if he choose, take food at night,since the observance of the vow is not necessary for him who has not performed Agnyâdheya. For so long as he has not set up a (sacrificial) fire of his own, he is merely a man, and may therefore, if he choose, take food at night.
1	4	3	Here now some tie up a he-goat , arguing that the goat is sacred to Agni and that (this is done) for the completeness of the fire. But he need not do this. Should he possess a he-goat, let him present it to the Âgnîdhra on the next morning; for it is thereby that he obtains the object he desires. He need, therefore, take no notice of that (practice).
1	4	4	They  then cook a rice-pap sufficient for (the) four (priests) to eat, 'Hereby we gratify the metres,' so they say, arguing that this is done in the same way as if one were to order a team, which he is going to use for driving, to be well fed. He need not, however, do this: for indeed that same wish (which he entertains in so doing) he obtains by the very fact that Brahmans, be they sacrificial priests or not, are residing in his family (kula) : he need, therefore, take no notice of that (practice).
1	4	5	Having then made a hollow in it (the pap) forclarified butter to be poured in, and having poured clarified butter into it, they anoint three sticks of asvattha wood with this butter and put them on the fire with the (three) Rik-verses containing the words 'kindling-stick (samidh)' and 'butter (ghrita) ;' arguing that thereby they obtain what has grown out of a samî . It is, however, only by (daily) putting (three kindling-sticks) on the fire for a whole year previous (to the Âdhâna) that one obtains that object: let him therefore take no notice of that (practice).
1	4	6	And on this point Bhâllabeya remarked, 'If he were to cook that rice-pap, this would assuredlybe a mistake, just as if one were to do one thing, while intending to do another; or if one were to say one thing, while intending to say another; or if one were to go one way, while intending to go another.' And, indeed, it is not proper that they should either carry to the south, or extinguish, that fire on which a kindling-stick is put, or an oblation made, with a rik or a sâman or a yagus. Now they do indeed either take it to the south with the view of its becoming the Anvâhâryapakana (or Dakshinâgni), or (if there is to be no Dakshinâgni) they extinguish it .
1	4	7	Thereupon they  remain awake (during that night). The gods are awake: so that he thereby draws nigh to the gods, and sets up his fires as one more godly, more subdued, more endowed with holy fervour (tapas). He may, however, sleep, if he choose, since the observance of the vow is not necessary for him who has not performed Agnyâdheya. For so long as he has not set up a (sacrificial) fire of his own, he is a mere man; and he may, therefore, sleep, if he choose.
1	4	8	Now some churn (the fire)  before sunrise andtake it eastwards (from the Gârhapatya to the Âhavanîya) after sunrise, arguing that thereby they secure both the day and the night for the obtainment of out-breathing and in-breathing, of mind and speech. But let him not do so; for when they thus churn (the fire) before sunrise, and take it eastwards after sunrise, both his (fires) are in reality set up before sunrise. By churning the Âhavanîya after sunrise he will obtain that (combination of blessings).
1	4	9	The gods, assuredly, are the day. The fathers have not the evil dispelled from them (by the sun); (and accordingly) he (the sacrificer) does not dispel the evil (if he churns the fire before sunrise). The fathers are mortal; and verily he who churns the fire before the rising of the sun, dies before (he has attained his full measure of) life. The gods have the evil dispelled from them (by the sun): hence he (the sacrificer) dispels the evil (from himself, if he churn after sunrise). The gods are immortal; and--though there is for him no prospect of immortality--he attains (the full measure of life). The gods are bliss, and bliss he obtains; the gods are glorious, and glorious he will be, whosoever, knowing this, churns (the fire) after the rising of the sun.
1	4	10	Here now they say, 'If the fire is not setup with either a rik-verse, or a sâman, or a yagus, wherewith then is it set up?' Verily, that (fire) is of the brahman: with the brahman it is set up. The brahman is speech: of that speech it is. The brahman is the truth, and the truth consists in those same (three) mystic utterances: hence his (fire) is established by means of the truth.
1	4	11	Verily, with 'bhûh (earth)!' Pragâpati generated this (earth) ; with 'bhuvah (ether)!' the ether; with 'svah (heaven)!' the sky. As far as these (three) worlds extend, so far extends this universe: with the universe it (the fire) is accordingly established.
1	4	12	With 'bhûh!' Pragâpati generated the Brahman (priesthood); with 'bhuvah!' the Kshatra (nobility); with 'svah!' the Vis (the common people). As much as are the Brahman, the Kshatra, and the Vis, so much is this universe: with the universe it (the fire) is accordingly established.
1	4	13	With 'bhûh!' Pragâpati generated the Self; with 'bhuvah!' the (human) race; with 'svah!' the animals (pasu). As much as are the Self, the (human) race, and the animals, so much is this universe: with the universe it (the fire) is accordingly established.
1	4	14	'Bhûr bhuvah!' this much he utters while laying down the Gârhapatya fire; for if he were to lay it down with all (three words), wherewith should he lay down the Âhavanîya? Two syllables he leaves over, and thereby those (five syllables) become of renewed efficacy; and with all the five syllables--'Bhûr bhuvah svah'--he lays down the Âhavanîya. Thus result eight syllables; for of eight syllables consists the gâyatrî, and the gâyatrî is Agni's metre: he thus establishes that (fire) by means of its own metre.
1	4	15	Now when the gods were about to set up their fires, the Asuras and Rakshas forbade them, saying, 'The fire shall not be produced; ye shall not set up your fires!' and because they thus forbade (raksh) them, they are called Rakshas.
1	4	16	The gods then perceived this thunderbolt, to wit, the horse. They made it stand before them, and in its safe and foeless shelter the fire was produced. For this reason let him (the Adhvaryu) direct (the Âgnîdhra) to lead the horse to where he is about to churn the fire. It stands in front of him : he thus raises the thunderbolt, and in its safe and foeless shelter the fire is produced.
1	4	17	Let it be one used as a leader ; for such a one possesses unlimited strength. Should he be unable to obtain a leader, it may be any kind of horse. Should he be unable to obtain a horse, it may also be an ox, since that (fire) is related (bandhu) to the ox .
1	4	18	And when they carry that (fire) eastward ,they lead the horse in front of it; so that, in proceeding in front of it, it wards off from it the evil spirits, the Rakshas; and they carry it (to the Âhavanîya) safely and unmolested by evil spirits.
1	4	19	Let them carry it (the fire) in such wise that it turns back towards him (the sacrificer); for, assuredly, that fire is the (means of) sacrifice, and it is in the direction of him (the sacrificer) that the sacrifice enters him, that the sacrifice readily inclines to him. And, verily, from whomsoever it (the fire) turns away, from him the sacrifice also turns away; and if any one were to curse him, saying, 'May the sacrifice turn away from him!' then he would indeed be liable to fare thus.
1	4	20	Moreover, that (fire) is the (sacrificer's) breath: let them therefore carry it in such wise that it turnsback towards him; for it is in the direction of him that the breath enters into him. And, verily, from whomsoever it (the fire) turns away, from him the breath also turns away; and if in that case any one were to curse him, saying, 'May the breath turn away from him!' then he would indeed be liable to fare thus.
1	4	21	And, verily, the sacrifice is yonder blowing (wind). Let them, therefore, carry it in such wise that it  turns towards him; for it is in the direction of him that the sacrifice enters him, that the sacrifice readily inclines to him. And from whomsoever it turns away, from him the sacrifice also turns away; and if any one were to curse him, saying, 'May the sacrifice turn away from him!' then he would indeed be liable to fare thus.
1	4	22	And, verily, that (fire) is the (sacrificer's) breath. Let them, therefore, carry it in such wise that it turns towards him; for it is in the direction of him that the breath enters into him. And from whomsoever it (the fire) turns away; from him the breath also turns away; and if any one were to curse him, saying, 'May the breath turn away from him!' he would indeed be liable to fare thus.
1	4	23	He (the Adhvaryu) then makes the horse step on (the Âhavanîya fire-place) . When he has made it step on it, he leads it out towards the east, makes it turn round again (from left to right) and lets itstand there facing the west. The horse doubtless represents strength: hence he makes it turn round again in order that this strength shall not turn away from him (the sacrificer).
1	4	24	He lays that (fire) down on the horse's footprint ; for the horse represents strength, so that he thereby lays it down on strength: for this reason he lays it down on the horse's foot-print.
1	4	25	In the first place he silently touches (the footprint with the burning fire-wood). He then lifts it up and touches once more with it; and at the third time he lays it down with , 'Earth! ether! heaven!' For there are three worlds indeed; so that he thereby obtains these (three) worlds. This now is one (mode of laying down the fire).
1	4	26	Then there is this other. Silently he touches (the foot-print with it) in the first place; he then lifts it up, and at the second time lays it down with 'Earth! ether! heaven!' For he who wants to lift a load without having a firm footing on this (earth), cannot lift it; nay, it crushes him.
1	4	27	Now, when he touches it silently he thereby takes a firm footing on this resting-place; and having obtained a firm footing on it, he lays down (the fire): and thus he wavers not. Here now Âsuri, Pâñki, and Mâdhuki held it (the fire) slightly to the back (or west of the fire-place) . 'For,' they argued, 'everything else (that is on the hearth)becomes, as it were, relaxed (on being touched by the fire): he should therefore, after holding it up, lay it down at the first (touching) with "Earth! ether! heaven!" for thus no relaxation takes place.' Let him then do this in whichever way he may deem proper.
1	4	28	He (the sacrificer) then goes round to the east side (of the fire), and taking hold of the top part of the burning sticks he mutters : 'Like unto the sky in plenty, like unto the earth in greatness!' When he says, 'Like unto the sky in plenty,' he means to say, 'Like as yonder sky is plenteous with stars, so may I become plenteous!' and when he says, 'Like unto the earth in greatness,' he means to say, 'As great as this earth is so great may I become!'--'On that back of thine, O Earth, that art meet for the worship of the gods'--for on her back he lays down that (fire)--'I lay down Agni, the eater of food, for the obtainment of food.' Agni is an eater of food: 'May I become an eater of food,' this is what he thereby says. This is a prayer for blessing,--he may mutter it, if he choose; or, if he choose, he may omit it.
1	4	29	He stands worshipping by (the fire) while muttering the (three) Rik-verses of the queen of serpents  ,--'Hither has come that spotted bull and has settled down before the mother; and before the father on going up to heaven.--She moves along through the luminous spheres, breathing forth from his breath: the mighty (bull) has illuminedthe sky.--He rules over the thirty domains; and song is bestowed on the winged one, yea, with the light at the break of day!' Thus he recites; and whatever (benefit) has not been obtained by him either through the equipments, or through the asterisms, or through the seasons, or through the laying down of the fire, all that is thereby obtained by him; and for this reason he stands worshipping by (the fire), while muttering the verses of the queen of serpents.
1	4	30	They say, however, that one need not stand by (the fire) worshipping with the verses of the queen of serpents. For the queen of serpents, they argue, is this earth; and accordingly when he lays down the fire on her, he thereby obtains all his desires: hence he need not stand by (the fire) worshipping with the verses of the queen of serpents.
2	1	1	When he has taken out the Âhavanîya fire , he performs the Full-offering . The reason whyhe performs the full-offering is that he thereby causes that Agni to become an eater of food for his own self; that he thereby offers food to him. Even as (a mother or cow) would offer the breast to a new-born child or calf, so does he thereby offer food to him.
2	1	2	And having been appeased by that food, he (Agni) waits patiently for the other oblations to be cooked. If, on the other hand, that oblation were not to be offered up in him, he would ere long burn either the Adhvaryu or the sacrificer, for these two pass nearest by him. This is the reason why he makes this offering.
2	1	3	He offers it (with a) full (spoon); for the full doubtless means the All (universe), so that he thereby appeases him with the All. He offers it with 'Svâhâ!' for the Svâhâ is undefined, and undefined also is the All, so that he thereby appeases him by means of the All.
2	1	4	The first offering which Pragâpati made, he made with 'Svâhâ!' Now that (offering) indeed is virtually the same as this one; and hence he (the sacrificer) also makes it with 'Svâhâ!' At this (offering) he grants a boon (to the priests) ; buta boon (may mean) everything, so that he thereby appeases him (Agni) with everything.
2	1	5	Here now they say, 'When he has made this offering, he need not attend to the subsequent oblations; for by this offering he obtains that wish for which he takes out the subsequent oblations.'
2	1	6	He takes out (material for an oblation)  to Agni Pavamâna (the Blowing) . Now the blowing one is the breath, so that he thereby puts breath into him (the sacrificer). And this he puts into him by means of this (offering); for breath means food, and this offering also is food.
2	1	7	He then makes offering to Agni Pâvaka (the Purifying). Now the purifying one means food, so that he thereby puts food into him (Agni, or the sacrificer). And this he puts into him by means of this (offering), for this offering is indeed food.
2	1	8	He then makes offering to Agni Suki (the Bright). Now brightness means vigour, so that he thereby puts vigour into him. And this he puts into him by means of this (offering); for when he offers up that oblation in him (Agni), then that vigour, that brightness of his blazes up.
2	1	9	For this reason they say, 'When he has made that (full) offering, he need not attend to any further oblations; for by this offering he obtains that wish for which he takes out the subsequent oblations.' But let him nevertheless take out the subsequent oblations; for what invisible (blessing, or meaning) there was in that (full-offering) that now becomes thus (visible).
2	1	10	Now the reason why he makes offering to Agni Pavamâna, is that the blowing one is the breath. When (the child) is born, then there is breath. And as long as it is not born, it breathes in accord with the mother's breath; but when it is born, then he thereby puts breath into it.
2	1	11	And the reason why he makes offering to Agni Pâvaka, is that the purifying one means food: hence he thereby puts food into (the child) when it is born.
2	1	12	And the reason why he makes offering to Agni Suki, is that brightness means vigour. Now when it (the child) grows by means of food, then there is vigour; and hence, when he has made it grow by means of food, he thereby puts into it that vigour, that brightness. This is why (he offers) to Agni Suki.
2	1	13	That other (practice) then is altogether erroneous . For when Agni passed over from the gods to men, he bethought him, 'I must not pass over to men with my whole body!'
2	1	14	He then laid down in these (three) worlds those three bodies of his. That 'blowing (pavamâna)' form of his he laid down on this earth, that 'purifying (pâvaka)' one in the ether, and that 'bright (suki)' one in the sky. Now the Rishis then existing became aware of this: 'Agni has not come to us with his whole body,' they said. They then prepared those oblations for him.
2	1	15	Now when he makes offering to Agni Pavamâna, he thereby obtains that form of his (Agni's) which he laid down on this earth; and when he makes offering to Agni Pâvaka, he thereby obtains that form of his which he laid down in the ether; and when he makes offering to Agni Suki, he thereby obtains that form of his which he laid down in the sky: and thus he lays down the entire Agni unmutilated. For this reason also he should take out the oblations subsequent (to the full-offering).
2	1	16	The first oblation has a barhis (altar-covering of sacrificial grass) to itself; the two following ones have one barhis in common. Now the first oblation represents this world, the second one that ether, and the third one the sky. But this earth is compact; and the ether and yonder sky are, as it were, trembling: and in order that these two may counterbalance that (earth), the (last) two (oblations) have one barhis in common.
2	1	17	All these sacrificial cakes (for Agni) are on eight potsherds; for of eight syllables consists the (pâda of the) gâyatrî, and the gâyatrî is Agni's metre : with its own metre he accordingly establishes that fire. In all, these potsherds amount to twenty-four; for of twenty-four syllables consists the gâyatrî (stanza), and the gâyatrî is Agni's metre: with its own metre he accordingly establishes that fire.
2	1	18	He then offers a potful of boiled rice to Aditi. For he who performs those (preceding) oblations moves away, as it were, from this world, since he moves in the ascent of these worlds .
2	1	19	Now when he offers a potful of boiled rice to Aditi,--Aditi being this earth, and this earth being a firm resting-place,--he thereby again takes his stand on this firm resting-place. This is why he offers a potful of boiled rice to Aditi.
2	1	20	For her, they say, the two samyâgyâs  should be virâg verses; for the virâg is this (earth); ortrishtubh verses, for the trishtubh is this (earth); or gagatî verses, for the gagatî is this (earth). Still, however, they should be virâg verses.
2	1	21	The priests' fee for (offering to) her consists of a cow; for this (earth) is, as it were, a cow: she milks out for men all their desires. The cow is a mother, and this (earth) also is a mother, for she bears the men: for this reason the priests' fee is a cow. This is one mode (of performing those offerings).
2	1	22	Then there is this other. He simply offers a cake on eight potsherds to Agni, and thereby, implicitly, to Agni Pavamâna, Agni Pâvaka, and Agni Suki; and immediately after he visibly sets him up (as Agni). For this reason he offers (a cake) to Agni , and then a potful of boiled rice to Aditi. The treatment of the potful of rice (in that case) is the same (as before).
2	2	1	Now, in performing that sacrifice, they slay it; and in pressing out the king (Soma), they slay him; and in quieting and immolating the victim, they slay it. The haviryagña they slay with the mortar and pestle, and with the two mill-stones.
2	2	2	When slain, that sacrifice was no longer vigorous. By means of dakshinâs (gifts to the priests) the gods again invigorated it: hence the name dakshinâ, because thereby they invigorated (dakshay) that[paragraph continues] (sacrifice). Whatever, therefore, fails in this sacrifice when slain, that he now again invigorates by means of gifts to the priests; whereupon the sacrifice becomes successful: for this reason he makes gifts to the priests.
2	2	3	He may give six (cows) ; for six seasons, indeed, there are in the year, and the sacrifice, Pragâpati, is the year: thus as great as the sacrifice is, as large as its extent is, by so many (gifts, dakshinâs) does he thereby invigorate it.
2	2	4	He may give twelve; for twelve months there are in the year, and the sacrifice, Pragâpati, is the year: thus as great as the sacrifice is, as large as its extent is, by so many (gifts) does he thereby invigorate it.
2	2	5	He may give twenty-four; for twenty-four half-moons there are in the year, and the sacrifice, Pragâpati, is the year: thus as great as the sacrifice is, as large as its extent is, by so many (gifts) does he thereby invigorate it. Such is the measure of the priests' fees; but he may give more, according to (the depth of) his faith. The reason why he gives fees to the priests is this.
2	2	6	Verily, there are two kinds of gods; for, indeed, the gods are the gods; and the Brâhmans who have studied and teach sacred lore are the human gods. The sacrifice of these is divided into two kinds: oblations constitute the sacrifice to the gods; and gifts to the priests that to the human gods,the Brâhmans who have studied and teach sacred lore. With oblations one gratifies the gods, and with gifts to the priests the human gods, the Brâhmans who have studied and teach sacred lore. Both these kinds of gods, when gratified, place him in a state of bliss (sudhâ) .
2	2	7	Even as seed is poured into the womb, so the officiating priests place the sacrificer in the (heavenly) world , when he now makes gifts to those who, he hopes, will make him go thither. Such, then, (is the manner) of gifts to priests.
2	2	8	Now the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pragâpati, were contending with each other. They were both soulless, for they were mortal, and he who is mortal is soulless. Among these two (classes of beings) who were mortal, Agni alone was immortal; and it was through him, the immortal, that they both lived. Now whichsoever (of the gods) they (the Asuras) slew, he, indeed, was so (slain).
2	2	9	Thereupon the gods were left inferior. They went on praising and practising austerities, hoping that they might be able to overcome their enemies, the mortal Asuras. They beheld this immortal Agnyâdheya (consecrated fire).
2	2	10	They said, 'Come, let us place that immortal element in our innermost soul! When we have placed that immortal element in our innermost soul, and become immortal and unconquerable, we shall overcome our conquerable, mortal enemies.'
2	2	11	They said, 'With both of us is this fire (Agni): let us then treat openly with the Asuras .'
2	2	12	They said, 'We shall set up (or, establish within ourselves, â-dhâ) the two fires,--what will ye do then?'
2	2	13	They replied, 'Then we shall lay it down (ni-dhâ), saying, Eat grass here! eat wood here! cook pap here! cook meat here!' Now that fire, which the Asuras thus laid down, is this same (fire) wherewith men prepare their food.
2	2	14	The gods then established that (fire) in their innermost soul; and having established that immortal element in their innermost soul, and become immortal and unconquerable, they overcame their mortal, conquerable enemies. And so this one now establishes that immortal element in his innermost soul; and--though there is for him no hope of immortality--he obtains the full measure of life; for, indeed, he becomes unconquerable, and his enemy, though striving to conquer, conquers him not. And, accordingly, when one who has established his fires and one who has not established his fires, vie with each other, he who has established his fires overcomes the other, for, verily, he thereby becomes unconquerable, he thereby becomes immortal.
2	2	15	Now, when, on that occasion, they produce that (fire) by churning, then he (the sacrificer) breathes (blows) upon it, when produced; for fire indeed is breath: he thereby produces the one thus produced. He again draws in his breath: thereby he establishes that (fire) in his innermost soul; and that fire thus becomes established in his innermost soul .
2	2	16	Having kindled it, he makes it blaze, thinking, 'Herein I will worship, herein I will perform the sacred work!' Thereby he makes blaze that fire which has been established in his innermost soul.
2	2	17	'It (or some one) might come between,--it might go away!' so (fear some) ; but, surely, as long as he lives no one comes between him and that fire which has been established in his innermost soul: let him, therefore, not heed this. And as to its becoming extinguished:--surely, as long as he lives, that fire which has been established in his innermost soul, does not become extinct in him.
2	2	18	The (sacrificial) fires, assuredly, are those breaths: the Âhavanîya and Gârhapatya are the out-breathing and the in-breathing; and the Anvâhârya-pakana is the through-breathing.
2	2	19	Now, attendance on (or, the worship of) that consecrated fire (agnyâdheya) means (speaking) the truth. Whosoever speaks the truth, acts as if he sprinkled that lighted fire with ghee; for even so does he enkindle it: and ever the more increases his own vital energy, and day by day does he become better. And whosoever speaks the untruth, acts asif he sprinkled that lighted fire with water; for even so does he enfeeble it: and ever the less becomes his own vital energy, and day by day does he become more wicked. Let him, therefore, speak nothing but the truth.
2	2	20	Now the kinsmen spake unto Aruna Aupavesi, 'Thou art advanced in years: establish thou the two fires!' He replied, 'Speak ye not thus! be thou a restrainer of speech ; for he who has established the fires must not speak an untruth: let him rather not speak at all, but let him not speak an untruth. Worship, above all, is truthfulness.'
2	3	1	Now Varuna established this (fire), being desirous of sovereignty. He obtained sovereignty; and, accordingly, whether one (who has established the fires) knows (this) or not, they call him 'king Varuna.' Soma (established the fire), being desirous of glory. He became glorious, and, accordingly, whether one obtains a hold on Soma, or whetherone does not, they both obtain (glory),--for it is glory that people thereby get to see. Glorious therefore he becomes, and sovereignty he obtains, whosoever, knowing this, establishes a sacrificial fire of his own.
2	3	2	Now once upon a time the gods deposited with Agni all forms (rûpa) , both domestic and wild; either because they were about to engage in battle, or from a desire of free scope, or because they thought that he (Agni) would protect them as the best protector.
2	3	3	But Agni coveted them, and seizing them he entered the seasons with them. 'Let us go back thither,' said the gods, and betook themselves to the place where) Agni (was) concealed. They were disheartened and said, 'What is here to be done? what counsel is there?'
2	3	4	Then Tvashtri beheld that re-consecrated fire (Punar-âdheya). He established it and thereby gained an entrance to Agni's beloved abode. He (Agni) gave up to him both kinds of forms, domestic and wild: hence they call them Tvashtri's forms; since it is from Tvashtri that all form proceeds ; but all other creatures of whatever kind undergo it.
2	3	5	It is for him (Tvashtri), then, that one must re-establish the fire: for thus he enters Agni'sbeloved abode, and the latter gives up to him both kinds of forms, domestic and wild. In that (fire) those two kinds of forms are seen: such is the ascendancy (which one obtains by the punarâdhyeya),--people, indeed, envy him; thus he thrives, and a conspicuous position (is obtained by him).
2	3	6	To Agni belongs this sacrifice. Agni is the light, the burner of evil: he burns away the evil of this (sacrificer): and the latter becomes a light of prosperity and glory in this, and a light of bliss  in yonder, world. This, then, is the reason why he should establish the fires (a second time).
2	3	7	Let him establish the fires (the second time) in the rainy season. The rains are all the seasons, for the rains are indeed all the seasons: hence, in counting over years, people say, 'In such and such a year (or rain, varsha) we did it; in such and such a year (or rain) we did it.' The rains, then, are one of the forms of manifestation (rûpa) of all seasons ; and when people say, 'To-day it is as if in summer,' then that is in the rainy season; and when they say, 'To-day it is as if in spring,' then that, too, is in the rainy season. From the year (or rain, varsha), indeed, (is named) the rainy season (varshâh).
2	3	8	There is, moreover, an occult form (through which the rains manifest themselves in the seasons) . When it blows from the east, then that is the characteristic sign of spring:--when it thunders, it is that ofsummer;--when it rains, it is that of the rainy season; when it lightens, it is that of autumn ;--when it ceases to rain, it is that of winter. The rains are all the seasons. The seasons he (Agni) entered: from out of the seasons, therefore, he now produces him.
2	3	9	But the sun also is all the seasons: when he rises, then it is spring;--when the cows are driven together (for milking), then it is summer;--when it is mid-day, then is the rainy season;--when it is afternoon, then it is autumn;--when he sets, then it is winter. At mid-day (madhyandina), therefore, he should establish his fires, for then that (sun) is nearest to this world, and hence he produces that (fire) from the nearest centre (madhya).
2	3	10	Verily, this man is affected with evil, as with a shadow. But then (at mid-day) that (evil) of his (like his shadow) is smallest, and shrinks, as it were, beneath his foot: hence he thereby crushes that evil, when it is smallest. For this reason also he should establish his fires (the second time) at mid-day.
2	3	11	He takes it out (from the Gârhapatya) by means of sacrificial grass. By means of fire-wood, indeed, he takes it out the first time; and (were he to take it out) with fire-wood the first time, and with fire-wood the second time, he would commit a repetition, and raise a conflict. Now sacrificial grass means water, and the rainy season also means water. He (Agni) entered the seasons: with water he accordingly produces him from out of the waters; this is why he takes it (the fire) out by means of sacrificial grass.
2	3	12	Having prepared an (ordinary) rice cake ontwo arka  leaves, he puts it in the place where he is about to establish the Gârhapatya fire, and thereon lays down the Gârhapatya.
2	3	13	Having prepared a (second) barley cake on two arka leaves, he puts it in the place where he is about to establish the Âhavanîya fire, and thereon lays down the Âhavanîya. [Some do so] arguing, 'Thereby we cover them with the first two fires;' but let him not do so, for it is by the nights that they come to be covered.
2	3	14	He then offers to Agni a sacrificial cake (purodâsa) on five potsherds . Its offering prayers and invitatory prayers consist of paṅkti strophes of five pâdas each ; for there are five seasons, and the seasons he (Agni) entered: from the seasons he accordingly produces him.
2	3	15	The whole (sacrifice) belongs to Agni; for it was thereby that Tvashtri entered Agni's beloved abode, and therefore the whole (sacrifice) belongs to Agni .
2	3	16	They perform it (with the formulas pronounced) in a low voice; for if one wishes to prepare anything specially for a relative or friend, one must take care to keep it secret. Now the other sacrifice belongs to all the deities, but this belongs specially to Agni; and what is (kept) secret, that is (spoken of) in a low voice: this is why they perform it in a low voice.
2	3	17	The last after-offering he performs aloud; for then he has completed his work, and every one becomes aware of what has been done.
2	3	18	Having uttered his call (and having been responded to by the Âgnîdhra) , he says (to the Hotri), 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the Samidhs (kindling-sticks)!'--the latter being one of Agni's mystic forms of manifestation (rûpa); but he may also say, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the fires!'--that being Agni's real (exoteric) form .
2	3	19	He (the Hotri) recites , '. . . They (the Samidhs), O Agni, may accept of the butter! Vaughak !' '. . . He (Tanûnapât) may accept the fire of the butter! Vaughak!' '. . . . They (the Ids) may, through Agni, accept of the butter! Vaughak!' '. . . It (the barhis), the fire, may accept of the butter! Vaughak!'
2	3	20	He then says , 'Svâhâ Agnim!' with reference to Agni's butter-portion;--'Svâhâ Agnim Pavamânam!' if they determine upon (offering to) Agni, the blowing ; or 'Svâhâ Agnim Indumantam!' if they determine upon Agni, the drop-abounding ;--'Svâhâ Agnim!'--'Svâhâ, the butter-drinking Agnis! May Agni graciously accept of the butter!'--this is the offering-prayer he (the Hotri) pronounces.
2	3	21	He (the Adhvaryu) then says, with regard to Agni's (first) butter-portion, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni!' He (the Hotri) recites , 'Awake Agni with praise, enkindling the immortal, that he may take our offerings to the gods!' For, indeed, when Agni is removed (from the hearth) , he, as it were, sleeps: he (the priest) now awakens, rouseshim. For the offering-prayer he recites, 'May Agni graciously accept of the butter!'
2	3	22	And, if they determine upon (offering the second butter-portion to (Agni Pavamâna, let him then say, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni Pavamâna; and he (the Hotri) recites , 'O Agni, thou breathest forth life; produce thou food and sap for us! drive far away misfortune!' For thus, indeed, it becomes of the nature of Agni. Pavamâna (the one that becomes purified) means the Soma; but this (Soma-element) they eliminate from the butter-portion of Soma . For the offering-prayer he recites, 'May Agni Pavamâna graciously accept of the butter!'
2	3	23	If, on the other hand, they determine upon (offering to) Agni Indumat, let him say, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni Indumat!' He (the Hotri) recites , 'Come hither, I will gladly sing to thee yet other songs, O Agni! mayest thou grow strong by these draughts (indu, drop).' Thus, indeed, it becomes of the nature of Agni: the draught doubtless means Soma, but this (Soma-element) they eliminate from the butter-portion of Soma. For the offering-prayer he recites, 'May Agni, the drop-abounding, graciously accept of the butter!' And thus he makes it all of the nature of Agni.
2	3	24	He then says, as to the chief offering (havis), 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni!' 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to Agni!' 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni Svishtakrit (the maker of good offerings)!' 'Pronounce the offering-prayerto Agni Svishtakrit !' Then where (otherwise) he would say, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the gods !' he now says, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the Agnis!'
2	3	25	He recites , '[The divine Barhis] may accept (the offering) for Agni's abundant obtainment of abundant gift! Vaughak!'--'[The divine Narâsamsa] may accept (the offering) for abundant obtainment, in Agni, of abundant gift! Vaughak!'--'The divine Agni Svishtakrit . . . .' this third (after-offering) is already in itself of the nature of Agni; and thus he makes the after-offerings relate to Agni.
2	3	26	Those same case-forms (of agni) , which he recites in the offering-prayers, are six; namely, four at the fore-offerings, and two at the after-offerings. Now there are six seasons; and the seasons he (Agni) entered: out of the seasons he accordingly thereby produces him.
2	3	27	There are either twelve or thirteen syllables (in these six case-forms) . Now there are either twelve or thirteen months in a year ; and theyear, the seasons, he (Agni) entered: out of the seasons he accordingly thereby produces him. In order to avoid sameness, no two (of these forms) are alike; but (the fault of) sameness he would undoubtedly commit, were any two of them alike. The characteristic form of the fore-offerings is (alternately), 'May they accept,' 'May it (or he) accept ;' and that of the after-offerings is, 'For the abundant obtainment of abundant gift.'
2	3	28	The priests' fee for this (sacrifice) consists of gold , This sacrifice belongs to Agni, and gold is Agni's seed : this is why the priests' fee consists of gold. Or it may be an ox; for the latter is of the nature of Agni as far as its shoulder is concerned, since its shoulder (by carrying the yoke) is as if burnt by fire. Moreover, Agni is oblation-bearer to the gods, and that (ox) bears (or draws, loads) for men: this is why an ox may be given as the priests' fee.
2	4	1	Pragâpati alone, indeed, existed here in the beginning. He considered, 'How may I be reproduced?'[paragraph continues] He toiled and performed acts of penance. He generated Agni from his mouth; and because he generated him from his mouth, therefore Agni is a consumer of food: and, verily, he who thus knows Agni to be a consumer of food, becomes himself a consumer of food.
2	4	2	He thus generated him first (agre) of the gods; and therefore (he is called) Agni, for agni (they say) is the same as agri. He, being generated, went forth as the first (pûrva); for of him who goes first, they say that he goes at the head (agre). Such, then, is the origin and nature of that Agni.
2	4	3	Pragâpati then considered, 'In that Agni I have generated a food-eater for myself; but, indeed, there is no other food here but myself, whom, surely, he would not eat.' At that time this earth had, indeed, been rendered quite bald; there were neither plants nor trees. This, then, weighed on his mind.
2	4	4	Thereupon Agni turned towards him with open mouth; and he (Pragâpati) being terrified, his own greatness departed from him. Now his own greatness is his speech: that speech of his departed from him. He desired an offering in his own self, and rubbed (his hands); and because he rubbed (his hands), therefore both this and this (palm) are hairless. He then obtained either a butter-offering or a milk-offering;--but, indeed, they are both milk.
2	4	5	This (offering), however, did not satisfy him, because it had hairs mixed with it. He poured it away (into the fire), saying, 'Drink, while burning (osham dhaya)!' From it plants sprang: hence their name 'plants (oshadhayah).' He rubbed (his hands) a second time, and thereby obtained anotheroffering, either a butter-offering or a milk-offering;--but, indeed, they are both milk.
2	4	6	This (offering) then satisfied him. He hesitated: 'Shall I offer it up? shall I not offer it up?' he thought. His own greatness said to him, 'Offer it up!' Pragâpati was aware that it was his own (sva) greatness that had spoken (âha) to him; and offered it up with 'Svâhâ!' This is why offerings are made with 'Svâhâ!' Thereupon that burning one (viz. the sun) rose; and then that blowing one (viz. the wind) sprang up; whereupon, indeed, Agni turned away.
2	4	7	And Pragâpati, having performed offering, reproduced himself, and saved himself from Agni, Death, as he was about to devour him. And, verily, whosoever, knowing this, offers the Agnihotra, reproduces himself by offspring even as Pragâpati reproduced himself; and saves himself from Agni, Death, when he is about to devour him.
2	4	8	And when he dies, and when they place him on the fire, then he is born (again) out of the fire, and the fire only consumes his body. Even as he is born from his father and mother, so is he born from the fire. But he who offers not the Agnihotra, verily, he does not come into life at all: therefore the Agnihotra should by all means be offered.
2	4	9	And as to that same birth from out of doubt,--when Pragâpati doubted, he, while doubting, remained steadfast on the better (side), insomuch that he reproduced himself and saved himself from Agni, Death, when he was about to devour him: so he also who knows that birth from out of doubt, when he doubts about anything, still remains on the better (side).
2	4	10	Having offered, he rubbed (his hands). Thencea Vikaṅkata  tree sprung forth; and therefore that tree is suitable for the sacrifice, and proper for sacrificial vessels. Thereupon those (three) heroes among the gods were born, viz. Agni, that blower (Vâyu), and Sûrya: and, verily, whosoever thus knows those heroes among the gods, to him a hero is born.
2	4	11	They then said, 'We come after our father Pragâpati: let us then create what shall come after us!' Having enclosed (a piece of ground), they sang praises with the gâyatrî stanza without the 'Hiṅ :' and that (with) which they enclosed was the ocean; and this earth was the praising-ground (âstâva).
2	4	12	When they had sung praises, they went out towards the east, saying, 'We (will) go back thither!' The gods came upon a cow which had sprung into existence. Looking up at them, she uttered the sound 'hiṅ.' The gods perceived that this was the 'Hiṅ' of the Sâman (melodious sacrificial chant); for heretofore (their song was) without the but after that it was the (real) Sâman. And as this same sound 'Hiṅ' of the Sâman was in the cow, therefore the latter affords the means of subsistence; and so does he afford the means of subsistence whosoever thus knows that 'Hiṅ' of the Sâman in the cow.
2	4	13	They said, 'Auspicious, indeed, is what we have produced here, who have produced the cow: for, truly, she is the sacrifice, and without her no sacrifice is performed; she is also the food, for the cow, indeed, is all food.'
2	4	14	This (word 'go'), then, is a name of those[paragraph continues] (cows), and so it is of the sacrifice: let him, therefore, repeat  it, (as it were) saying, 'Good, excellent!' and, verily, whosoever, knowing this, repeats it; (as it were) saying, 'Good, excellent!' with him those (cows) multiply, and the sacrifice will incline to him.
2	4	15	Now, Agni coveted her: 'May I pair with her,' he thought. He united with her, and his seed became that milk of hers: hence, while the cow is raw, that milk in her is cooked (warm); for it is Agni's seed; and therefore also, whether it be in a black or in a red (cow), it is ever white, and shining like fire, it being Agni's seed. Hence it is warm when first milked; for it is Agni's seed.
2	4	16	They (the men) said, 'Come, let us offer this up!'--'To whom of us shall they first offer this?' (said those gods).--'To me!' said Agni.--'To me!' said that blower (Vâyu).--'To me!' said Sûrya. They did not come to an agreement; and not being agreed, they said, 'Let us go to our father Pragâpati; and to whichever of us he says it shall be offered first, to him they shall first offer this.' They went to their father Pragâpati, and said, 'To whom of us shall they offer this first?'
2	4	17	He replied, 'To Agni: Agni will forthwith cause his own seed to be reproduced, and so you will be reproduced.' 'Then to thee,' he said to Sûrya; 'and what of the offered (milk) he then is still possessed of, that shall belong to that blower[paragraph continues] (Vâyu)!' And, accordingly, they in the same way offer this (milk) to them till this day: in the evening to Agni, and in the morning to Sûrya; and what of the offered (milk) he then is still possessed of, that, indeed, belongs to that blower.
2	4	18	By offering, those gods were produced in the way in which they were produced, by it they gained that victory which they did gain: Agni conquered this world, Vâyu the air, and Sûrya the sky. And whosoever, knowing this, offers the Agnihotra, he, indeed, is produced in the same way in which they were then produced, he gains that same victory which they then gained;--indeed, he shares the same world with them, whosoever, knowing this, offers the Agnihotra. Therefore the Agnihotra should certainly be performed.
3	1	1	The Agnihotra, doubtless, is the Sun. It is because he rose in front (agre) of that offering , that the Agnihotra is the Sun.
3	1	2	When he offers in the evening after sunset, he does so thinking, 'I will offer, while he is here, who is this (offering);' and when he offers in the morning before sunrise, he does so thinking, 'I will offer, while he is here, who is this (offering):' and for this reason, they say, the Agnihotra is the Sun.
3	1	3	And when he sets, then he, as an embryo, enters that womb, the fire; and along with him thus becoming an embryo, all these creatures become embryos; for, being coaxed, they lie down contented .[paragraph continues] The reason, then, why the night envelops that (sun), is that embryos also are, as it were, enveloped.
3	1	4	Now when he offers in the evening after sunset, he offers for the good of that (sun) in the embryo state, he benefits that embryo; and since he offers for the good of that (sun) in the embryo state, therefore embryos here live without taking food.
3	1	5	And when he offers in the morning before sunrise, then he produces that (sun-child) and, having become a light, it rises shining. But, assuredly, it would not rise, were he not to make that offering: this is why he performs that offering.
3	1	6	Even as a snake frees itself from its skin, so does it (the sun-child) free itself from the night, from evil: and, verily, whosoever, knowing this, offers the Agnihotra, he frees himself from all evil, even as a snake frees itself from its skin; and after his birth all these creatures are born; for they are set free according to their inclination.
3	1	7	Then, as to his taking out the Âhavanîya (from the Gârhapatya) before the setting of the sun;--the rays, doubtless, are all those gods; and what highest light there is, that, indeed, is either Pragâpati or Indra. Now all the gods approach the house of him who performs the Agnihotra: but whosesoever (offering) they approach before the fire has been taken out, from that the gods turn away, and he fails in it; and after the failure of that (offering) from which the gods turn away, people say, that, whether one knows it or not, the sun went down on account of that (fire) not having been taken out.
3	1	8	And another reason why he takes out the Âhavanîya before the setting of the sun, is this. In like manner as, when one's better comes to visitone, he would honour him by trimming his house, so here: for whosesoever (offering) they approach, after the fire has been taken out, his Âhavanîya (house) they enter, in his Âhavanîya they repose.
3	1	9	Now when he offers in the evening after the sun has set, he thereby offers to them after they have entered his fire-house; and when he offers in the morning before sunrise, he offers to them before they go away. Therefore Âsuri said, 'The Agnihotra of those who offer after sunrise we regard as useless : it is as if one were to take food to an empty dwelling.'
3	1	10	That which affords (the means of) subsistence is of two kinds; namely, either rooted or rootless. On both of these, which belong to the gods, men subsist. Now cattle are rootless and plants are rooted. From the rootless cattle eating the rooted plants and drinking water, that juice is produced.
3	1	11	Now when he offers in the evening after sunset, he does so thinking, 'I will offer to the gods of this life-giving juice: we subsist on this which belongs to them.' And when he afterwards takes his evening meal, he eats what remains of the offering, and whereof oblative portions (bali) have been distributed all round ; for he who performs the Agnihotra eats only what remains of the offering.
3	1	12	And when he offers in the morning before sunrise, he does so thinking, 'I will offer to the gods of this life-giving juice: we subsist on this which belongs to them.' And when he afterwards takes his meal in the day-time, he eats what remains of theoffering, and whereof oblative portions have been distributed all round; for he who performs the Agnihotra eats only what remains of the offering.
3	1	13	Here now they say,--All other sacrifices come to an end, but the Agnihotra does not come to an end. Although that which lasts for twelve years is indeed limited, this (Agnihotra) is nevertheless unlimited, since, when one has offered in the evening, he knows that he will offer in the morning; and when one has offered in the morning, he knows that he will again offer in the evening. Hence that Agnihotra is unlimited, and in consequence of this its unlimitedness, creatures are here born unlimited. And, verily, he who thus knows the unlimitedness of the Agnihotra, is himself born unlimited in prosperity and offspring.
3	1	14	Having milked  he puts that (milk) on (the Gârhapatya fire), because it has to be cooked. Here now they say, 'When it rises to the brim, then we shall offer it!' He must not however let it rise to the brim, since he would burn it, if he were to let it rise to the brim; and unproductive indeed is burnt seed: he must not, therefore, let it rise to the brim.
3	1	15	He should not offer it without having put it on the fire; for since this is Agni's seed, therefore it is hot (srita, 'cooked'); and by putting it on thefire, it is indeed heated: let him, therefore, offer (of the milk) only after he has put it on the fire.
3	1	16	He illumines it (with a burning straw)  in order that he may know when it is done. He then pours some water to it (with the sruva), both for the sake of appeasement, and in order to supplement the juice. For when it rains here; then plants spring up; and in consequence of the plants being eaten and the water drunk, this juice is produced: hence it is in order to supplement the juice (that he pours water to it); and therefore, if it should happen to him to have to drink pure milk, let him have one drop of water poured into it, both for the sake of appeasement, and in order to supplement the juice.
3	1	17	Thereupon he ladles four times (milk with the sruva into the Agnihotra ladle ), for in a fourfold way was that milk supplied . He then takes a kindling-stick (samidh), and hastes up (to the Âhavanîya, with the ladle) to make the libation on the burning (stick) . He offers the first libation[paragraph continues] (pûrvâhuti) without putting down (the spoon) beside (the fire, on the grass-bunch). For, were he to put it down beside (the fire), it would be as if, in taking food to somebody, one were to put it down on one's way thither. But when (he makes the libation) without previously putting it down, it is as if, in taking food to somebody, one puts it down only after taking it to him. The second (libation he then makes) after putting it down: he thereby makes these two (libations) of various vigour. Now these two: libations are mind and speech: hence he thereby separates mind and speech from each other; and thus mind and speech, even while one and the same (samâna), are still distinct (nânâ).
3	1	18	Twice he offers in the fire, twice he wipes (the spout of the spoon), twice he eats (of the milk), and four times he ladles ;--these are ten (acts), forof ten syllables consists the virâg stanza, and the sacrifice is virâg (shining): he thereby converts the sacrifice into the virâg.
3	1	19	Now what he offers up in the fire, that he offers to the gods; and thereby the gods are (admitted to the sacrifice) . And what he wipes off (the spoons), that he offers to the fathers and plants; and thereby the fathers and plants are (admitted). And what he eats after offering, that he offers to men; and thereby men are (admitted).
3	1	20	Verily, the creatures that are not allowed to take part in the sacrifice are forlorn; to those creatures that are not forlorn he thus offers a share at the opening of the sacrifice; and thus beasts (cattle) are made to share in it along with (men), since beasts are behind men .
3	1	21	On this point Yâgñavalkya said, 'It (the Agnihotra) must not be looked upon as a (havis-) sacrifice, but as a domestic sacrifice (pâkayagña); for while in any other (havis-)sacrifice he pours into the fire all that he cuts off (from the sacrificial dish and puts) into the offering spoon,--here, after offering and stepping outside , he sips water and licks out (the milk); and this indeed (is a characteristic) of the domestic offering.' This then is the animalcharacteristic  of that (Agnihotra), for the domestic offering pertains to beasts (or cattle).
3	1	22	Now the first of these libations, doubtless, is the same as that which Pragâpati offered in the beginning ; and as those (gods) thereupon continued (to sacrifice) ,--namely, Agni, that blower (Vâyu), and Sûrya,--so this second libation is offered.
3	1	23	What first libation (pûrvâhuti) is made, that is the deity of the Agnihotra , and to that (deity) it is accordingly offered; and what second one (uttarâhuti) is made, that indeed is equivalent to the Svishtakrit (Agni, the maker of good offering); whence he offers it on the north part (of the fire), since that is the region of the Svishtakrit . Moreover, this second libation is made in order to effect a pairing, for a couple forms a productive pair.
3	1	24	These two libations, then, form a duad: the past and the future, the born and the to-be-born, the actual  and the hope, the to-day and the morrow,--(these are) after the manner of that duad.
3	1	25	The past is the self, for certain is that which is past, and certain also is that which is a self. The future, on the other hand, is progeny; for uncertain is that which is to be, and uncertain also is progeny.
3	1	26	The born is the self, for certain is that which is born, and certain also is the self. The to-be-born,on the other hand, is progeny; for uncertain is what is to be born, and uncertain also is progeny.
3	1	27	The actual is the self, for certain is what is actual, and certain also is the self. And hope is progeny, for uncertain is hope, and uncertain also is progeny.
3	1	28	The to-day is the self, for certain is what is to-day, and certain also is the self. The morrow is progeny, for uncertain is the morrow, and uncertain also is progeny.
3	1	29	Now that first libation is offered on account of the self: he offers it with a sacred text, for certain is the sacred text, and certain also is the self. And that second one is offered on account of progeny: he offers it silently, for uncertain is what (is done) silently, and uncertain also is progeny.
3	1	30	[In the evening] he offers (the first libation), with the text , 'Agni is the light, the light is Agni, Svâhâ!' and in the morning with, 'Sûrya (the sun) is the light, the light is Sûrya, Svâhâ!' Thus offering is made with the truth; for, truly, when the sun goes down, then Agni (fire) is the light, and when the sun rises, then Sûrya is the light; and whatever is offered with the truth, that, indeed, goes to the gods.
3	1	31	Here now Takshan recited for Âruni , who wished to obtain holy lustre (brahmavarkasa, inspired nature), 'Agni is lustre, light is lustre;'--'Sûrya is lustre, light is lustre.' Holy lustre, therefore, he obtains whosoever, knowing this, thus offers the Agnihotra.
3	1	32	That (other text), however, has the characteristic form of generation. In saying, 'Agni is the light, the light is Agni, Svâhâ!' he encloses that seed, the light, on both sides with the deity; and the seed, thus enclosed on both sides, is brought forth: thus enclosing it on both sides he causes it to be brought forth.
3	1	33	And when, in the morning, he says, 'Sûrya is the light, the light is Sûrya, Svâhâ!' he encloses that seed, the light, on both sides with the deity, and the seed, thus enclosed on both sides, is brought forth: thus enclosing it on both sides he causes it to be brought forth; and this, indeed, is the characteristic form of generation.
3	1	34	But Gîvala Kailaki said , 'Âruni merely causes conception to take place, not birth: let him therefore offer with that  in the evening.
3	1	35	Then, in the morning, by the text, "The light is Sûrya, Sûrya is the light," he places that seed, the light, outside by means of the deity; and the seed thus brought outside he causes to be born.'
3	1	36	They also say, 'In the evening he offers Sûrya in Agni, and in the morning he offers Agni in Sûrya .' Such, indeed, is the case with those who offer after sunrise; for when the sun sets then Agni is the light, and when the sun rises then Sûrya is the light. Here no offence is committed on his (the sacrificer's) part; but an offence is indeed committed where offering is not made distinctly to that deity (viz. Agni or Sûrya resp.), which is the deity of the Agnihotra.[paragraph continues] He says , 'Agni is the light, the light is Agni, Svâhâ!' and not, 'To Agni Svâhâ!' and in the morning, 'Sûrya is the light, the light is Sûrya, Svâhâ!' and not, 'To Sûrya Svâhâ!'
3	1	37	He may also offer (in the evening) with this text , 'Along with the divine Savitri--,' whereby it (the sacrifice) becomes possessed of Savitri for his impulsion; '--along with the Night, wedded to Indra--,' whereby he effects a union with the night, and makes it (the sacrifice) possessed of Indra, for Indra is the deity of the sacrifice; '--may Agni graciously accept! Svâhâ!' whereby he offers to Agni in a direct manner.
3	1	38	And in the morning with, 'Along with the divine Savitri--,' whereby it becomes possessed of Savitri for his impulsion; '--along with the Dawn, wedded to Indra,' or 'along with the Day . . . .--,' whereby he effects a union either with the day or the dawn , and makes it (the sacrifice) possessed of Indra; for Indra is the deity of sacrifice; '--may Sûrya graciously accept! Svâhâ!' whereby he offers to Sûrya directly: hence he may offer in this way.
3	1	39	They then spake, 'Who shall offer this unto us?'--'The priest (brâhmana)!'--'Priest, offer this  unto us! What is to be my share then? The residue of the Agnihotra!' Now what he leaves inthe ladle, that is the residue of the Agnihotra; and what remains in the pot, is as (the rice for oblations which) one takes out from the enclosed part (of the cart) . And if any one is to drink it, at least none but a Brâhman must drink it : for it is put on the fire (and thereby consecrated), and hence none but a Brâhman must drink it.
3	2	1	Verily, in him that exists , these deities reside, to wit, Indra, king Yama, Nada the Naishadha  (king), Anasnat Sâṅgamana, and Asat Pâmsava.
3	2	2	Now Indra, in truth, is the same as the Âhavanîya; and king Yama is the same as the Gârhapatya; and Nada Naishadha is the same as the Anvâhâryapakana (Dakshina fire); and because day by day they take that (fire) to the south, therefore indeed they say that day by day Nada Naishadha carries king Yama  (further) south.
3	2	3	And again what fire there is in the hall (sabhâ), that is the same as Anasnat Sâṅgamana: Anasvat (not eating) it is for the reason that peopleapproach it before they eat. And that (place) where they throw the ashes they remove (from the fireplaces) is the same as Asat Pâmsava. And whosoever knows this, thus gains all those worlds, traverses all those worlds, thinking, 'In me those gods reside.'
3	2	4	Now as to rendering homage to (upasthâna, lit. standing near) these (fires). When in the evening and morning (after the Agnihotra) he stands by the Âhavanîya, and sits down by it, that is the homage rendered to that (fire). And when, on stepping back to the Gârhapatya, he either sits or lies down, that is the homage rendered to that (fire). And when, in walking (out of the sacrificial ground), he remembers the Anvâhâryapakana, and thus, in his mind, tarries near it, that is the homage rendered to that (fire).
3	2	5	And again, before taking food in the morning, having sat down for a moment in the hall, he may also, if he like, walk round (the Sabhya or hall-fire),--and this is the homage rendered to that (fire). And when he steps near where lie the ashes removed (from the fire-places) that is the homage rendered to that (fire). And thus homage has been rendered to those deities of his.
3	2	6	Now the Gârhapatya (householder's fire) has the sacrificer for its deity; and the Anvâhâryapakana (southern fire) has his foe for its deity: hence they should not take over that (southern fire) every day (from the Gârhapatya); and he indeed has no enemies, for whomsoever, knowing this, they do not take it over every day. Indeed, it is the Anvâhâryapakana .
3	2	7	Let them only take it over on the fast-day (of the new and full-moon sacrifice), when they are about to sacrifice on this (the Âhavanîya fire): thus that (southern) one is taken over in order to prevent failure on his (the sacrificer's) part.
3	2	8	Or they may also take it over to a new dwelling; and let them then cook on it food (other than meat) for the priests to eat. And should he not be able to procure anything to cook, let him order the milk of a cow to be put thereon and let the priests be asked to drink it. And his enemies will indeed fare ill, for whomsoever, knowing this, they do so: let him, therefore, endeavour by all means to do so.
3	2	9	Now when it is first kindled, and there is as yet nothing but smoke, then indeed that(fire) is Rudra. And if anyone (Kshatriya) desires to consume food (belonging to others),--even as Rudra seeks after these creatures, now with distrust, now with violence, now in striking them down,--let him offer then: and, assuredly, he who, knowing this, offers then (when the fire has just been lighted), obtains that food.
3	2	10	And when it burns rather brightly, then indeed that (fire) is Varuna. And if any one desires to consume food,--even as Varuna seeks after these creatures, now, as it were, seizing on them, now with violence, now in striking them down,--let him offer then: and, assuredly, he who, knowing this, offers then, obtains that food.
3	2	11	And when it is in full blaze, and the smoke whirls upwards with the utmost speed, then indeed that (fire) is Indra. And if any one wishes to be like Indra in splendour and glory, let him offer then: and, assuredly, he who, knowing this, offers then, obtains that food (object).
3	2	12	And when the flame of the waning (fire) gets lower and lower, and (burns) as it were sideways, then, indeed, that (fire) is Mitra. And if any one desires to consume food here through the kindness (maitra, of others),--as one of whom they say, 'Truly, this Brahman is everybody's friend, he harms not any one,'--let him offer (the Agnihotra) then: and, assuredly, he who, knowing this, offers then (when the fire gets low), obtains that food.
3	2	13	And when the coals are glowing intensely, then, indeed, that (fire) is the Brahman. And if anybody wishes to become endowed with holy lustre (brahmavarkasin), let him offer then: and, assuredly, he who, knowing this, offers then, obtains that food (object).
3	2	14	Let him endeavour to adhere to some one of these (gods or fires) for a year, whether he (the householder) himself offer (the Agnihotra) or some one else offer for him. If, on the other hand, he offers now in this way, now in another, it is just as if, in digging for water or some other food, one were to leave off in the midst of it. But if he offers uniformly, it is just as if, in digging for water or some other food, one lays it open forthwith.
3	2	15	Indeed, these offerings are, as it were, the spades for (the digging up of) food; and, assuredly, whosoever, knowing this, offers the Agnihotra, procures food.
3	2	16	Now the first libation (pûrvâhuti) represents the gods, and the second (uttarâhuti) represents the men, and what remains in the ladle represents cattle.
3	2	17	Only a little he offers for the first libation, somewhat more for the second, and still more he leaves in the ladle.
3	2	18	The reason why he offers only a little for the first libation, is that the gods are fewer than men; and why he offers somewhat more for the second libation, is that men are more numerous than the gods; and why he leaves still more in the ladle, is that cattle are more numerous than men. And, verily, whosoever, knowing this, offers the Agnihotra, his cattle will be more numerous than those (human beings) that have to be supported by him: for he, indeed, is in a prosperous condition whose cattle are more numerous than those (human beings) dependent on his support.
3	3	1	Now when Pragâpati, in creating living beings, created Agni, the latter, as soon as born, sought to burn everything here: and so everybody tried to get out of his way . The creatures then existing sought to crush him. Being unable to endure this, he went to man.
3	3	2	He said, 'I cannot endure this: come, let me enter into thee! Having reproduced me, maintain me; and as thou wilt reproduce and maintain me in this world, even so will I reproduce and maintain thee in yonder world!' He (man) replied, 'So be it.' And having reproduced him, he maintained him.
3	3	3	Now when he establishes the two fires, he reproduces that (Agni); and having reproduced him, he maintains him; and as he reproduces and maintains him in this world, even so does he (Agni) reproduce and maintain him in yonder world.
3	3	4	One must not, therefore, remove it (the sacrificial fire from the hearth) prematurely, for toosoon it languishes for him; and as it languishes for him too soon in this world, even so does it languish for him too soon in yonder world: one must not, therefore, remove it prematurely.
3	3	5	And when he dies, and they place him on the (funeral) fire, then he is reproduced from out of the fire; and he (Agni) who heretofore was his son , now becomes his father.
3	3	6	Hence it has been said by the Rishis , 'A hundred autumns (may there he) before us, O gods, during which ye complete the life-time of our bodies, during which sons become fathers! do not cut us off, midway, from reaching the full term of life!' for he (Agni) who is the son, now in his turn becomes the father: this, then, is why one must establish the fires.
3	3	7	Now yonder burning (sun) doubtless is no other than Death; and because he is Death, therefore the creatures that are on this side of him die. But those that are on the other side of him are the gods, and they are therefore immortal. It is by the rays (or reins, thongs, rasmi) of that (sun) that all these creatures are attached to the vital airs (breaths or life), and therefore the rays extend down to the vital airs.
3	3	8	And the breath of whomsoever he (the sun) wishes he takes and rises, and that one dies. And whosoever goes to yonder world not having escaped that Death, him he causes to die again and again in yonder world, even as, in this world, one regards not him that is fettered, but puts him to death whenever one wishes.
3	3	9	Now when, in the evening after sunset, he offers two libations, then he firmly plants himself on that Death with those fore-feet of his; and when, in the morning before sunrise, he offers two libations, then he plants himself on that Death with those hind-feet of his. And when he (the sun) rises, then, in rising, he takes him up and thus he (the sacrificer) escapes that Death. This, then, is the release from death in the Agnihotra: and, verily, he who knows that release from death in the Agnihotra, is freed from death again and again.
3	3	10	What the arrow-head is to the arrow, that the Agnihotra is to sacrifices. For whither the head of the arrow flies, thither the whole arrow flies: and so are all his works of sacrifice freed by this (Agnihotra) from that Death.
3	3	11	Now day and night, revolving, destroy (the fruit of) man's righteousness in yonder world. But day and night are on this side (of the sun) from him (after he has gone up to heaven); and so day and night do not destroy (the fruit of) his righteousness.
3	3	12	And as, while standing inside a chariot, one would look down from above on the revolving chariot-wheels, even so does he look down from on high upon day and night: and, verily, day and night destroy not the reward of him who thus knows that release from day and night.
3	3	13	[The sacrificer] having gone round the Âhavanîya, (after entering) from the east , passesbetween (it and) the Gârhapatya (to his seat). For the gods do not know (this) man ; but when he now passes by them between (the fires), they know him, and think, 'This is he that now offers to us.' Moreover, Agni (the fire) is the repeller of evil; and these two, the Âhavanîya and Gârhapatya, repel the evil from him who passes between them; and the evil being repelled from him, he becomes a very light in splendour and glory.
3	3	14	On the north side is the door of the Agnihotra : thus (he approaches it) as he would enter (a house) by a door. If, on the other hand, he were to sit down after approaching from the south, it would be as if he walked outside.
3	3	15	The Agnihotra, truly, is the ship (that sails) heavenwards. The Âhavanîya and Gârhapatya are the two sides  of that same heavenward-bound ship; and that milk-offerer is its steersman.
3	3	16	Now when he walks up towards the east, then he steers that (ship) eastwards towards theheavenly world, and he gains the heavenly world by it. When ascended from the north it makes him reach the heavenly world; but if one were to sit down in it after entering from the south, it would be as if he tried to enter it after it has put off and he were left behind and remained outside.
3	3	17	And again, the stick which he puts on the fire (corresponds to) a brick, and the formula wherewith he offers is the Yagus-text wherewith he puts on that brick ; and when the brick is put on, then a libation is made: hence those same libations of the Agnihotra are offered on his pile of bricks .
3	3	18	The fire, assuredly, is Pragâpati,--and Pragâpati is the year. Year after year, therefore, is his Agnihotra consummated with the piled-up fire-altar; and year after year does he obtain the piled-up fire altar, whosoever, knowing this, offers the Agnihotra.
3	3	19	Seven hundred and twenty eighties of Rik-verses (he should recite at the Agnihotra in the course of a year). When he offers the Agnihotra in the morning and evening, then there are two libations: hence those libations of his, in the course of a year, amount to--
3	3	20	Seven hundred and twenty. Thus, indeed, his Agnihotra is accomplished, year after year, with the great chant ; and year after year does he obtainthe great chant, whosoever, knowing this, offers the Agnihotra.
3	4	1	Once on a time the gods deposited with Agni all their beasts, both domestic and wild; either because they were about to engage in battle or from a desire of free scope, or because they thought that he (Agni) would protect them as the best protector.
3	4	2	Now Agni coveted them, and seizing them he entered the night with them. 'Let us go back thither,' said the gods, and betook themselves to where Agni was concealed. Now they knew that he had entered there, that he had entered the night; and when the night returned in the evening, they approached him and said, 'Give us our beasts! give us back our beasts!' Agni then gave them back their beasts.
3	4	3	For this then let him respectfully approach the two fires: the fires are givers, and thereby he supplicates them. Let him approach them in the evening, for in the evening the gods approached (Agni). And whosoever, knowing this, approaches (the two fires), to him, indeed, they grant cattle.
3	4	4	Then as to why he should not approach them. Now in the beginning both the gods and men were together here. And whatever did not belong to the men, for that they importuned the gods, saying, 'This is not ours: let it be ours!' Being indignantat this importunity, the gods then disappeared. Hence (it may be argued) one should not approach (the fires), fearing lest he should offend them, lest he should become hateful to them.
3	4	5	Then as to why he should nevertheless approach (the fires). The sacrifice, assuredly, belongs to the gods, and the prayer for blessing to the sacrificer. Now the (Agnihotra) libation, doubtless, is the same as the sacrifice; and what he does  in now approaching (the fires), that indeed is the sacrificer's prayer for blessing.
3	4	6	And again, why he should not approach (the fires). Whosoever follows either a Brâhman or Kshatriya, praising him, thinking, 'He will give me gifts, he will build me a house,' to him, if he strives to please him both in speech and deed, that (master of his) will think himself bound to give gifts. Whosoever, on the other hand, says, 'What art thou to me, that givest me nothing?' him that (master) is likely to hate, to become disgusted with. Hence one should not approach (the fire); for by kindling and offering in it, he already supplicates it, and he should not therefore approach (and importune it again).
3	4	7	And again, why he should nevertheless approach (the fires). He alone that asks finds a giver; and the master, moreover, knows nothing of his dependent. But when the latter says, 'I am thy dependent: support me!' then he does know him, and feels himself bound to support him. Let him therefore approach (the fires). This then is thewhole (argument) as to why one should approach (the fires).
3	4	8	Now that (fire) being Pragâpati,--when the Agnihotra is offered, he casts the seed of all that he rules over, of all that is after his manner: and by approaching (the fire) one imitates (him in) all this, one reproduces all this .
3	4	9	He begins to pray  with the verse  containing the word 'upon (upa).' Now the word 'upon' means this (earth), and that in a twofold way: for whatever is produced here, that is produced upon (upa-gan) this (earth); and whatever decays, that is buried (upa-vap ) in this (earth): hence there is here imperishable, ever-increasing abundance, and with that imperishable abundance he begins.
3	4	10	He prays, 'Entering upon the worship--,' worship (adhvara) doubtless means sacrifice: 'entering upon the sacrifice' is what he means to say. '--Let us offer prayer to Agni--,' for he is indeed about to offer prayer to him; '--to him who hears us even from afar!' thereby he means to say, 'Although thou art afar from us, yet do thou hear this our (prayer), do thou so far think well of it!'
3	4	11	[He continues, Vâg. S. III,
3	4	12	], 'Agni, the head,the summit of the sky; he, the lord of the earth, animates the seeds of the waters.' He thereby follows (and praises) him:--even as a supplicant would speak politely, 'Surely thou art the descendant of so and so! surely thou art able to do this!' so (he does) by this (verse).
3	4	12	Thereupon the verse to Indra and Agni , 'You two, O Indra and Agni, I will invoke; you two I will delight together with kindly office; you two, the givers of strength and wealth,--you two I invoke for the obtainment of strength!' Indra, doubtless, is the same as that burning (sun); when he sets, then he enters the Âhavanîya;--hence he now approaches these two that are thus united, thinking, 'May the two, united, grant me favours:' this is why the Indra-Agni (verse is muttered).
3	4	13	[He continues, ib.
3	4	14	seq.], 'This is thy natural womb, whence born thou shonest forth: knowing this, arise, O Agni, and increase our substance!'--substance, doubtless, means affluence: 'grant to us ever-increasing affluence!' is what he thereby says.
3	4	14	'First was he founded by the founders here, the best offering priest, worthy of praise at the sacrifices; he whom Apnavâna and the Bhrigus kindled , shining brightly in the wood, and spreading from house to house:'--even as a supplicant would speak politely, 'Surely thou art the descendant of so and so! surely thou art able to do this!' so in this (verse). And what he (Agni) really is, as such he speaks of him when he says 'spreading from house to house,' for he does indeed spread from house to house.
3	4	15	'In accordance with his old (pratna) splendour, the dauntless have milked the shining juice from the wise one that giveth a hundredfold.' The richest of gifts, indeed, is the hundredfold gift; and in order to obtain that (giver) he says, 'the wise one that giveth a hundredfold.'
3	4	16	This is a hymn of six verses collected (from the Rik); the first of them containing (the word) 'upon,' and the last containing (the word) 'old' (pratna). And this we recited, because she (the earth) is the one that contains the (word) 'upon;' and that which is 'old' doubtless is yonder (sky), for as many gods as there were 'of old,' in the beginning, so many gods there are now, and hence the 'old' means yonder (sky). Now within these two (worlds) all desires are contained; and these two are in accord with each other for his (the sacrificer's) benefit, and concede all his wishes.
3	4	17	Thrice he mutters the first (verse) and thrice the last; for of threefold beginning are sacrifices, and of threefold termination: therefore he mutters thrice the first and the last (verses).
3	4	18	Now, in offering the Agnihotra, whatever mistake one commits, either in word or deed, thereby he injures either his own body, or his life, or his vigour, or his offspring.
3	4	19	Accordingly , 'Thou, O Agni, art the protector of bodies: protect my body! Thou, O Agni, art the giver of life: give me life! Thou, O Agni, art the giver of vigour: give me vigour! O Agni, what defect there is in my body, supply that for me!'
3	4	20	And whatever mistake he commits, in offering the Agnihotra, either in word or deed, thereby heinjures either his own body, or his life, or his vigour, or his offspring: 'make that up for me!' he thereby says; and accordingly that (defect) is again made up for him.
3	4	21	[He continues, Vâg. S. III,
3	4	18	], 'Kindled, we enkindle thee, the brilliant one, a hundred winters--;' he thereby says, 'may we live a hundred years;' and 'so long we enkindle thee, the great one,' he says, when he says 'we enkindle thee, the brilliant one.' '--We, the vigorous--thee, the invigorating; we, the strong--thee, the giver of strength--;' whereby he says, 'may we be vigorous, mayest thou be invigorating! may we be strong, mayest thou be a giver of strength!' '--We, the uninjured--thee, the uninjurable injurer of enemies!' whereby he says, 'by thine aid may we render our enemies utterly miserable!'
3	4	22	'O thou, rich in lights, may I safely reach thine end!' this he mutters thrice. She that is rich in lights (kitrâvasu) doubtless is the night, since the latter, as it were, rests (vas) after gathering together the lights (kitrâ): hence (at night) one does not see clearly (kitram) from afar.
3	4	23	Now it was by means of this same (text) that the Rishis reached safely the end of the night; and because of it the evil spirits, the Rakshas, did not find them: by it, therefore, he also now reaches safely the end of the night; and because of it the evil spirits, the Rakshas, find him not.--This much he mutters while standing.
3	4	24	Thereupon, while seated, , 'Thou, O Agni, hast attained to Sûrya's lustre--;' this he says, because, in setting, the sun enters the Âhavanîya; '--to the praiseof the Rishis--;' this he says, because he himself now approaches (and worships, praises, the fire); '--to the favourite abode (or dainty);' his (Agni's) favourite abode doubtless are the offerings: 'to offerings' he thereby says. '--May I attain to long life, to lustre, to offspring, to increase of wealth!' whereby he says, 'Even as thou didst attain to those (qualities), so may I attain to long life, lustre, offspring, affluence,--that is to say, to prosperity.'
3	4	25	He then approaches the cow , with the text , 'Food ye are: may I enjoy your food! wealth ye are: may I enjoy your wealth!'--whereby he means to say, 'whatever energies are yours, whatever riches are yours, may I enjoy them.'--'Strength ye are: may I enjoy your strength!' whereby he says, 'sap ye are: may I enjoy your sap!'--'Affluence ye are: may I enjoy your affluence!' whereby he says, 'abundance ye are: may I enjoy your abundance!'
3	4	26	'Ye prosperous ones, disport yourselves--;' cattle are prosperous: therefore he says, 'ye prosperous ones, disport yourselves--;' '--in this seat, in this fold, in this place, in this homestead: remain here, go not from hence!' this he says with reference to himself,--'go not away from me!'
3	4	27	He then touches the cow, with the text , 'Motley thou art, of all shapes;'--for cattle are indeed of all shapes: therefore he calls her all-shaped; '--come to me with sap and possession of cattle!' when he says 'with sap,' he meansto say 'with juice;' and when he says with possession of cattle,' he means to say 'with abundance.'
3	4	28	He then steps up to the Gârhapatya, and renders homage to it, with the text , 'Thee, O Agni, illuminer of the night , we approach day by day with prayer, paying homage unto thee.' He thus renders homage to it in order that it may not injure him.
3	4	29	[He continues, ib.
3	4	23	seq.], 'Thee that rulest over the sacrifices, the brilliant guardian of the sacred rite, thriving in thine own house;'--whereby he means to say, 'thine own house is this (house) of mine: make it ever more flourishing for us!'
3	4	30	'O Agni, be thou accessible unto us, even as a father is to his son! lead us unto well-being!'--whereby he says, 'As a father is easy of access to his son, and the latter in no wise injures him, so be thou easy of access to us, and may we in no wise injure thee!'
3	4	31	Then the dvipadâ verses , 'O Agni, be ever nigh unto us, a kindly guardian and protector! as wealthy Agni, famed for wealth, come hither and bestow on us glorious riches! Thee, the most bright and resplendent, we now approach for happiness to our friends: be with us, hear our call, and keep us safe from every evil-doer!'
3	4	32	Now when he approaches the Âhavanîya, he prays for cattle: he therefore approaches it with metres great and small, since cattle are of great and small size. And when he approaches the Gârhapatya,he prays for men: hence the first tristich is in the gâyatrî metre, since the gâyatrî is Agni's metre, and he thus approaches him with his own metre.
3	4	33	Thereupon (he mutters) the dvipadâ (two-footed) verses. The dvipadâ, doubtless, is man's metre, since man is two-footed, and men are therewith prayed for: and as he now prays for men, therefore (he uses) dvipadâ verses. And whosoever, knowing this, approaches (the two fires), becomes possessed both of cattle and men.
3	4	34	He then goes (again) to the cow, with the text , 'O Idâ, come hither! O Aditi, come hither!' for both Idâ and Aditi are cows. He touches her with, 'Come hither, ye much-desired!'--for men's wishes are fixed on them, and hence he says, 'come hither, ye much-desired;'--'Let there be for me the fulfilment of wishes from you!' whereby he says, 'may I be dear to you!'
3	4	35	Thereupon, while standing between the Âhavanîya and Gârhapatya and looking eastward at the (former) fire, he mutters , 'O Lord of prayer, make him sweet-voiced, the offerer of Soma, Kakshîvat, Usig's son!--Be he with us, he the opulent, the killer of woe, the bestower of wealth, the increaser of prosperity, he the nimble!--Let not the curse of the evil-doer reach us, nor the guile of the mortal: preserve us, O Lord of prayer!'
3	4	36	Now when he approaches the Âhavanîya, he approaches the sky; and when (he approaches) the Gârhapatya, (he approaches) the earth. Hereby now (he approaches) the ether, that being Brihaspati's region; and that region he thereby approaches: this is why he mutters the prayer to Brihaspati.
3	4	37	[He continues, Vâg. S. III,
3	4	31-33	], 'May themighty, the heavenly, the unassailable favour of the three, Mitra, Aryaman, and Varuna, be (with us)! For the wicked enemy lords it not over them (that are protected by these gods), neither at home nor on dangerous paths: for those sons of Aditi bestow undying light on the mortal that he may live!'--In this (prayer) he says, 'nor on dangerous paths;' for dangerous indeed are the paths that lie between heaven and earth: those he now walks, and therefore he says, 'nor on dangerous paths.'
3	4	38	Then follows a verse to Indra ; for Indra is the deity of the sacrifice, and with Indra therefore he now connects the fire-worship: 'At no time, O Indra, art thou barren; and never dost thou fail the worshipper--;' the worshipper, doubtless, is the sacrificer: 'never dost thou harm the sacrificer,' this is what he thereby says: '--but more and evermore is thy gift increased, O mighty god!' thereby he says, 'do thou make us ever more prosperous here!'
3	4	39	Then follows a verse to Savitri  ,--for Savitri is the impeller (prasavitri) of the gods; and thus all his (the sacrificer's) wishes are fulfilled, impelled as they are by Savitri.--(He mutters), 'May we obtain the glorious light of the divine Savitri, who, we trust, may inspire our prayers!'
3	4	40	Thereupon a verse to Agni ,--whereby he finally makes himself over to Agni for protection: 'May thine unapproachable chariot, wherewith thou protectest the worshippers, encircle us on every side!' The worshippers, doubtless, arethe sacrificers; and what unassailable chariot he (Agni) possesses, therewith he protects the sacrificers. Hence he thereby means to say, 'what unassailable chariot thou possessest, wherewith thou protectest the sacrificers, therewith do thou guard us on every side.' This (verse) he mutters thrice.
3	4	41	He then pronounces his son's name : 'May this son (N.N.) carry on this manly deed of mine!' Should he have no son, let him insert his own name.
4	1	1	Now after the performance of the Agnihotra he (optionally ) .approaches the fires with , 'Earth! ether! sky!' In saying 'Earth! ether! sky!' he renders his speech auspicious by means of the truth, and with that (speech) thus rendered propitious he invokes a blessing:--'May I be well supplied with offspring!' whereby he prays for offspring; '--well supplied with men!' whereby he prays for men (heroes); '--well supplied with viands!' whereby he prays for prosperity.
4	1	2	That long (form of) fire-worship is a prayer for blessing, and so is this (short) one a prayer for blessing: hence even with this much he obtains all, and he may therefore worship the fires with it. 'Therewith, indeed, we perform,' so spake Âsuri.
4	1	3	Now, when he is about to set out on a journey , he approaches first the Gârhapatya, and thereupon the Âhavanîya.
4	1	4	The Gârhapatya he approaches with the text , 'Thou, that art friendly to man, protect my offspring!' He (Agni Gârhapatya), truly, is the guardian of offspring; and therefore he now makes over to him his offspring for protection.
4	1	5	He then approaches the Âhavanîya, with 'Thou, that art worthy of praise, protect my cattle!' He (Agni), truly, is the guardian of cattle, and therefore he now makes over to him his cattle for protection .
4	1	6	Thereupon he walks or drives off; and having got as far as what he considers to be the boundary , he breaks silence. And when he returns from his journey he maintains silence from the moment he sees what he considers to be the boundary. And even though there be a king inside (one's house), one must not go to him (or any other person before one has rendered homage to the fires).
4	1	7	He first approaches the Âhavanîya fire, and thereupon the Gârhapatya. The Gârhapatya doubtless is a house (grihâh), and a house is a safe resting-place: so that he thereby (finally ) establishes himself in a house, that is, in a safe resting-place.
4	1	8	He approaches the Âhavanîya fire, with the text , 'We have approached (thee), the all-knowing, the most liberal dispenser ofgoods: O Agni, sovereign lord, bestow on us lustre and strength!' Having then sat down he sweeps the blades of grass  (into the fire).
4	1	9	Thereupon he approaches the Gârhapatya, with the text, 'He, Agni Gârhapatya, is the lord of the house, the most liberal dispenser of goods to our offspring: O Agni, lord of the house, bestow on us lustre and strength!' Having then sat down, he sweeps off the blades of grass. In this way (householders) mostly approach the fires with muttered prayer.
4	1	10	However, one may also approach the fires silently,--and that for this reason:--If in the place (where one lives), a Brâhman or noble--in short, a better man--resides, one dares not say to him, 'I am going on a journey, take care of this (property) of mine !' Now in this (sacrificial ground) one's betters indeed reside, viz. the divine Agnis: who, then, would dare to say to them, 'I am going on a journey, take ye care of this (property) of mine!'
4	1	11	The gods assuredly see through the mind of man: that (Agni) Gârhapatya therefore knows that he (the householder) now approaches in order to givehimself up to him. Silently he approaches the Âhavanîya fire: that (Agni) Âhavanîya knows that he now approaches in order to give himself up to him.
4	1	12	Thereupon he walks or drives off; and having got as far as what he considers the boundary line, he releases his speech. And when he returns from the journey, he maintains silence from the moment he sees what he considers to be the boundary. And even though there be a king inside (one's house), one must not go to him.
4	1	13	He first approaches the Âhavanîya, and thereupon the Gârhapatya. Silently he approaches the Âhavanîya; and silently he sits down and sweeps away the grass-blades. Silently he approaches the Gârhapatya; and silently he sits down and sweeps away the grass-blades.
4	1	14	Then as to the observances in regard to (the entering of) his house. Now when a householder comes home from a journey, his house trembles greatly for fear of him, thinking, 'What will he say here? what will he do here?' It is therefore for fear of him that speaks or does anything on this occasion that the house trembles and is liable to crush his family; but him who neither speaks nor does anything, his house receives with confidence, thinking, 'He has not spoken here, he has not done anything here!' And should he be ever so angry at anything on this occasion, let him rather do on the next day whatever he might wish to say or do. This then is the observance in regard to the house .
4	2	1	Now the living beings once approached Pragâpati--beings doubtless mean creatures--and said, 'Ordain unto us in what manner we are to live!' Thereupon the gods, being properly invested with the sacrificial cord  and bending the right knee, approached him. To them he said, 'The sacrifice (shall be) your food; immortality your sap; and the sun your light!'
4	2	2	Then the fathers approached, wearing the cord on the right shoulder, and bending the left knee. To them he said, 'Your eating (shall be) monthly; your cordial (svadhâ) your swiftness of thought; and the moon your light!'
4	2	3	Then the men approached him, clothed and bending their bodies. To them he said, 'Your eating (shall be) in the evening and in the morning; your offspring your death; and the fire (Agni) your light!'
4	2	4	Then the beasts approached him. To them he granted their own choice, saying, 'Whensoever ye shall find anything, whether in season or out of season,ye shall eat it!' Hence whenever they find anything, whether in season or out of season, they eat it.
4	2	5	Thereupon--so they say--the Asuras also straightway  approached him. To them he gave darkness (tamas) and illusion (mâyâ): for there is indeed what is called the illusion of the Asuras. Those creatures, it is true, have perished; but creatures still subsist here in the very manner which Pragâpati ordained unto them.
4	2	6	Neither the gods, nor the fathers, nor beasts transgress (this ordinance); some of the men alone transgress it. Hence whatever man grows fat; he grows fat in unrighteousness, since he totters and is unable to walk because of his having grown fat by doing wrong. One should therefore eat only in the evening and morning; and whosoever, knowing this, eats only in the evening and morning, reaches the full measure of life; and whatever he speaks, that is (true); because he observes that divine truth. For, verily, that is Brâhmanic lustre (tegas), when one knows to keep His (Pragâpati's) law.
4	2	7	Now that (lustre) indeed belongs to him who presents (food) to the fathers once a month. When that (moon) is not seen either in the east or in the west, then he presents (food) to them; for that moon doubtless is king Soma, the food of the gods. Now during that night (of new moon) it fails them, and when it fails, he presents (food to them), and thereby establishes concord (between the gods and fathers). But were he to present (food) to them when it is not failing, he would indeed cause a quarrel between the gods and fathers: hence he presents[paragraph continues] (food) to them when that (moon) is not seen either in the east or in the west.
4	2	8	He presents it in the afternoon. The forenoon, doubtless, belongs to the gods; the mid-day to men; and the afternoon to the fathers: therefore he presents (food to the fathers) in the afternoon.
4	2	9	While seated behind the Gârhapatya, with his face turned toward the south , and the sacrificial cord on his right shoulder, he takes that (material for the offering from the cart) . Thereupon he rises from thence and threshes (the rice) while standing north of the Dakshina fire and facing the south. Only once he cleans (the rice) ; for it is once for all that the fathers have passed away, and therefore he cleans it only once.
4	2	10	He then boils it. While it stands on the (Dakshina) fire, he pours some clarified butter on it;--for the gods they pour the offering into the fire; for men they take (the food) off the fire; and for the fathers they do in this very manner: hence, they pour the ghee on it while it stands on the fire.
4	2	11	After removing it (from the fire) he offers to the gods two libations in the fire. For, in establishing his sacrificial fires, and in performing the new and full-moon sacrifice, that (householder) resorts to the gods. Here, however, he is engaged in asacrifice to the fathers: hence he thereby propitiates the gods, and being permitted by the gods, he presents that (food) to the fathers. This is why, on removing (the rice), he offers to the gods two libations in the fire.
4	2	12	He offers both to Agni and Soma . To Agni he offers, because Agni is allowed a share in every (offering); and to Soma he offers, because Soma is sacred to the fathers. This is why he offers both to Agni and Soma.
4	2	13	He offers  with the formulas , 'To Agni, the bearer of what is meet for the wise, svâhâ!' 'To Soma, accompanied by the fathers, svâhâ !' He then puts the pot-ladle on the fire,--that being in lieu of the Svishtakrit . Thereupon he draws (with the wooden sword) one line (furrow) south of the Dakshina fire ,--thatbeing in lieu of the altar: only one line he draws, because the fathers have passed away once for all.
4	2	14	He then lays down a firebrand at the farther (south) end (of the line). For were he to present that (food) to the fathers, without having laid down a firebrand, the Asuras and Rakshas would certainly tamper with it. And thus the Asuras and Rakshas do not tamper with that (food) of the fathers: this is why he lays down the firebrand at the farther end (of the line).
4	2	15	He lays it down, with the text , 'Whatsoever Asuras roam about at will , assuming various shapes ,--be they large-bodied or small-bodied ,--may Agni expel them from this world!' Agni is the repeller of the Rakshas, and therefore he lays (the firebrand) down in this way.
4	2	16	He then takes the water-pitcher and makes (the fathers) wash (their hands ) , merely  saying, 'N.N., wash thyself!' (naming) the sacrificer's father; 'N.N., wash thyself!' (naming) his grandfather; 'N.N., wash thyself!' (naming) his great-grandfather. As one would pour out water (for a guest) when he is about to take food, so in this case.
4	2	17	Now those (stalks of sacrificial grass) are severed with one stroke, and cut off near the root;--the top belongs to the gods, the middle part to men, and the root-part to the fathers: therefore they are cut off near the root. And with one stroke they are severed, because the fathers have passed away once for all.
4	2	18	He spreads them (along the line) with their tops towards the south. Thereon he presents [to the fathers the three (round) cakes of rice] . He presents them thus ;--for to the gods they offer thus; for men they ladle out (the food in any way they please) ; and in the case of the fathers they do in this very way: therefore he presents (the cakes to them) thus.
4	2	19	With, 'N.N., this for thee!' he presents (one cake) to the sacrificer's father. Some add, 'and for those who come after thee!' but let him not say this, since he himself is one of those to whom (it would be offered) in common : let himtherefore merely say, 'N.N., this for thee!' as to the sacrificer's father; 'N.N., this for thee!' as to his grandfather; and 'N.N., this for thee!' as to his great-grandfather. He presents (the food) in an order (directed) away from the present time, because it is away from hence that the fathers have once for all departed.
4	2	20	He then mutters , 'Here, O fathers, regale yourselves: like bulls come hither, each to his own share!' whereby he says, 'Eat ye each his own share!'
4	2	21	He then turns round (to the left), so as to face the opposite (north) side: for the fathers are far away from men; and thereby he also is far away (from the fathers). 'Let him remain (standing with bated breath) until his breath fail,' say some, 'for thus far extends the vital energy.' However , having remained so for a moment--
4	2	22	He again turns round (to the right) and mutters , 'The fathers have regaled themselves: like bulls they have come each to his own share;' whereby he means to say, 'They have eaten each his own share .'
4	2	23	Thereupon he takes the water-pitcher and makes them wash themselves , merely saying,[paragraph continues] 'N.N., wash thyself !' (naming) the sacrificer's father; 'N.N., wash thyself!' (naming) his grandfather; 'N.N., wash thyself!' (naming) his great-grandfather. Even as one would pour out (water for a guest) when he has taken his meal, so here.
4	2	24	He then pulls down the tuck  (of the sacrificer's garment) and performs obeisance. The tuck is sacred to the fathers (pitridevatyâ): therefore he performs obeisance to them after pulling down the tuck. Now obeisance means worship (or sacrifice): hence he thereby renders them worthy of worship. Six times he performs obeisance; for there are six seasons, and the fathers are the seasons: for this reason he performs obeisance six times. He mutters , 'Give us houses, O fathers!' for the fathers are the guardians (îsate) of houses; and this is the prayer for blessing at this sacrificial performance. After the cakes have been put back (in the dish containing the remains of boiled rice) he (the sacrificer) smells at (the rice); this (smelling) being the sacrificer's share. The[paragraph continues] (stalks of sacrificial grass) cut with one stroke he puts on the fire; and he also again throws away the firebrand .
4	3	1	Now Kahoda Kaushîtaki spake, 'This sap (of the plants) truly belongs to those two, heaven and earth: having offered of this sap to the gods, we will eat it.' 'That is why the offering of first-fruits is performed.'
4	3	2	And Yâgñavalkya also spake:--The gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pragâpati, once contended for superiority. The Asuras then defiled, partly by magic, partly with poison, both kinds of plants--those on which men and beasts subsist--hoping that in this way they might over come the gods. In consequence of this neither did men eat food, nor did beasts graze; and from want of food these creatures well-nigh perished .
4	3	3	Now the gods heard as to how these creatures were perishing from want of food. They spake unto one another, 'Come, let us rid them  of this!'--'By what means?'--'By means of the sacrifice.' By means of the sacrifice the gods then accomplished all that they wanted to accomplish ; and so did the Rishis.
4	3	4	They then said, 'To which of us shall this belong?' They did not agree (each of them exclaiming), 'Mine (it shall be)!' Not having come to an agreement, they said, 'Let us run a race for this (sacrifice): whichever of us beats (the others), his it shall be!' 'So be it!' they said, and they ran a race.
4	3	5	Indra and Agni won, and hence that Indra-Agni cake on twelve potsherds ; Indra and Agni having won a share in it. And where Indra and Agni were standing when they had won, thither all the gods followed them.
4	3	6	Now, Indra and Agni are the Kshatra (nobility), and all the gods (or, the All-gods) are the Vis (common Âryan people); and wherever the Kshatra conquers, there the Vis is allowed to share. Thus they (Indra and Agni) allowed the Visve Devâh (the All-gods) a share (in the offering); and hence that pap of boiled (rice or barley) grain (offered) to the All-gods.
4	3	7	'Let him prepare it from old (grain) ,' say some; 'for Indra and Agni are the Kshatra (and he should therefore use old grain for the Vaisvadeva pap) lest he (the sacrificer) should exalt (the Vis) to the level of the Kshatra.' Nevertheless let both (the cake and karu) consist of new (grain); for (by the very fact that) the one is a cake and the other a pap, the nobility is not equalled (by the people): hence they should both consist of new (grain).
4	3	8	The All-gods spake, 'This sap (of the rice and barley plants) truly belongs to those two, heaven and earth: let us, then, allow those two a share in it!' They accordingly assigned that share to them, to wit, the cake on one potsherd offered to heavenand earth . This is why there is a cake on one potsherd (kapâla) for heaven and earth. Now this (earth) is, doubtless, the cup (depository, kapâla) of that (sap) ; and she indeed is one only: hence (the cake) consists of one potsherd.
4	3	9	An offence (is thereby committed) by him ; since, for whatever deity sacrificial food may be taken out, the Svishtakrit (Agni, the maker of good offering) is invariably allowed a share in it after (the respective deity). But that (cake) he offers entire, and he does not cut off a portion for the Svishtakrit this is an offence, and consequently (that cake), when offered, turns upside down.
4	3	10	Hence they say, 'That (cake) contained on one potsherd has turned upside down: it will throw the kingdom into disorder.' No offence (is, however, committed) by him, for the Âhavanîya is the support of oblations; and if, after reaching the Âhavanîya, (the cake) were to turn upside down ten times, he need not heed it. And if others ask as to who would care to incur (the result of) such a combination (of errors), let him offer nothing but butter; for clarified butter is manifestly the sap ofthose two, heaven and earth, so that he thereby manifestly gladdens those two with their own sap or essence: hence he need offer nothing but butter.
4	3	11	By performing that same sacrifice, the gods removed the magic spell as well as the poison from both kinds of plants,--those on which men and beasts subsist; and henceforward the men ate food and the cattle grazed.
4	3	12	Now when he performs that sacrifice, he does so either for the reason that no one will then defile (the plants) either by magic or poison; or because the gods did so. And whatever share the gods assigned (to themselves), that share he thereby makes over to them. Moreover, he thereby renders wholesome and faultless both kinds of plants,--those on which men and beasts subsist; and these creatures subsist on those wholesome and faultless (plants) of his: this is why he performs that sacrifice.
4	3	13	The priests' fee for this (sacrifice) consists of the first-born calf (of the season); for that is, as it were, the first-fruits (of the cattle). If he has already performed the new and full-moon offerings, let him first perform those offerings , and thereupon the present (offering of first-fruits). If, on the other hand, he has not yet performed (the new and full-moon offerings), let them cook a kâtushprâsya  pap on the southern fire, and let the priests eat it.
4	3	14	Verily, there are two kinds of gods: for the gods themselves, assuredly, are gods; and those priests who have studied, and teach Vedic lore, are the human gods. And in like manner as that is offered whereon the Vashat has been pronounced, so is that (offering of first-fruits consecrated by the feeding of the priests). Let him also, at this (sacrifice), give as much as is in his power, for no offering, they say, should be without a dakshinâ. At the Agnihotra (performed at the time of the Âgrayaneshti) let him not offer (milk obtained from the eating of new corn) ; for were he to offer such at the Agnihotra, he would cause a conflict (between the deities of the two offerings). The Âgrayana is one thing, and the Agnihotra is another: let him, therefore, not offer (new material) at the Agnihotra.
4	4	Preface	Here also two days were, as a rule, required for the performance, both at full and new moon; but while, at the ordinary sacrifice,At full moon some authorities add a special ishti to Indra Vimridh ('the Averter of evil'). The new-moon performance concludes with libations of whey to the divine coursers (the horses of the gods); and, optionally, with an ishti to Âditya.The performance of the Dâkshâyana sacrifice was held to be obligatory only for a period of fifteen years , whereas the ordinary new and full-moon offerings had to be performed for double that period from the setting up of the sacred fires. Nay, even the daily performance of it with certain modifications, for a whole year, was supposed to acquit the householder of any further obligation in this respect; his sacrificial duties being henceforth limited to the performance of the Agnihotra, or morning and evening libations. The daily performance of the Dâkshâyana is so regulated that an afternoon and following forenoon are alternately assigned to the two days' ceremonies of the ordinary fortnightly Dâkshâyana sacrifice.
4	4	1	In the beginning Pragâpati, being desirous of offspring, sacrificed with this sacrifice: 'May I abound in offspring and cattle; may I obtain prosperity; may I become glorious; may I become an eater of food!' so he thought.
4	4	2	Now he was indeed Daksha: and becausehe sacrificed in the beginning with this sacrifice, it is called Dâkshâyana-sacrifice. Some, however, call it the Vasishtha-sacrifice; for he (Pragâpati) is indeed vasishtha (the best) , and after him they call it. He sacrificed with that sacrifice; and what race, what prosperity of Pragâpati was then produced through his performing that sacrifice, that same race he procreates, that same prosperity he obtains, whosoever, knowing this, performs that sacrifice: let him therefore perform that sacrifice.
4	4	3	Now that same sacrifice was afterwards performed by Pratîdarsa Svaikna; and he indeed was an authority  to those who emulated him. An authority, therefore, he will become, whosoever, knowing this, performs that sacrifice: let him, therefore, perform that sacrifice.
4	4	4	Him Suplan Sârñgaya approached for the sake of sanctity; and accordingly he was taught that sacrifice and another ; and having learnt it he went back to the Sriñgayas. Now they knew that he was coming to them after studying the sacrifice for their sake. They said, 'Verily, with the gods (saha devaih) he has come to us who has come after studying the sacrifice:' thus he (was called) Sahadeva Sârñgaya; and even now the saying is, 'Lo, Suplan has taken another name!' He performed that sacrifice; and what race and prosperity of the Sriñgayas was then produced through his performing that sacrifice, that same race he procreates, that same prosperity he obtains, whosoever,knowing this, performs that sacrifice: let him, therefore, perform that sacrifice.
4	4	5	That same sacrifice was afterwards performed by Devabhâga Srautarsha. He was Purohita both to the Kurus and the Sriñgayas. Now a very high position (is held by him) who is the Purohita of one kingdom: how much higher, then, is the position (of one) who (is the Purohita) of two (kingdoms). A very high position accordingly he obtains, whosoever, knowing this, performs that sacrifice: let him, therefore, perform that sacrifice.
4	4	6	That same sacrifice was afterwards performed by Daksha Pârvati; and even to this day these (descendants of his) the Dâkshâyanas are possessed of the royal dignity: royal dignity he, therefore, here obtains, whosoever, knowing this, performs that sacrifice: let him, therefore, perform that sacrifice.--Day by day there is one cake : thereby Fortune (srî) is (wedded) to him without a rival wife and undisturbed. He offers on two days of the full moon and on two of the new moon: for two means a pair, so that a productive pair is thereby obtained.
4	4	7	Now when , at full moon, he offers a (cake) to Agni and Soma on the first day,--these are two deities, and two means a pair: hence a productive pair is thereby obtained.
4	4	8	And on the morrow there are Agni's cake and Indra's Sânnâyya  ,--these are two deities, and two means a pair, so that a productive pair is thereby obtained.
4	4	9	Again when, at new moon, he offers a (cake) to Indra and Agni on the first day,--these are two deities, and two means a pair, so that a productive pair is thereby obtained.
4	4	10	Then on the morrow there are Agni's cake and Mitra and Varuna's curds. Now Agni's cake (is offered), for the sole purpose that it may not forsake the sacrifice . Then those two, Mitra and Varuna, are two deities, and two means a pair: hence a productive pair is thereby obtained; and thus is (produced) that form (of the sacrifice) whereby he becomes many, whereby he is reproduced.
4	4	11	And when, at full moon, he offers the Agni-Soma (cake) on the first day, then this is for him that victim which they slaughter for Agni and Soma on the fast-day (of the Soma-sacrifice) .
4	4	12	And on the morrow there are Agni's cake and Indra's Sânnâyya. Now Agni's cake is for him what the morning libation is (at the Soma-sacrifice), for the morning libation is indeed sacred to Agni; and the Sânnâyya is for him the mid-day libation, for the mid-day libation is indeed sacred to Indra.
4	4	13	And again when, at new moon, he offers the Indra-Agni (cake) on the first day, that is for him the same as the third (or evening) libation; for the third libation is sacred to the All-gods, and Indra and Agni truly are all the gods .
4	4	14	And on the morrow there are Agni's cake and Mitra and Varuna's curds. Now Agni's cake is (offered) for the sole purpose that it should notforsake the sacrifice and that dish of curds (payasyâ) is to him the same as that barren cow, the anûbandhyâ, which has to be slaughtered for Mitra and Varuna (at the Soma-sacrifice) : thus. by performing the full and new-moon offering one gains as much as is gained by performing a Soma-sacrifice; and that (offering) is indeed a great sacrifice.
4	4	15	And again when, at full moon, he offers the Agni-Soma (cake) on the first day,--it was by that (offering) that Indra slew Vritra ; it was thereby he gained that supreme authority which he now wields : and so does he (the sacrificer) thereby slay his wicked spiteful enemy and gain the superiority. And as to his mixing (sweet and sour milk),--the Sânnâyya is (the oblation) of the new moon (amâ-vâsyâ) , and the new moon  means being far away: to him who had slain Vritra this was forthwith (offered), and him they regaled with that draught. He therefore who, knowing this, prepares the Sânnâyya at full moon, forthwithdrives away evil. Now that moon doubtless is king Soma, the food of the gods: they extract it on the first day, intending to consume it on the next day; consequently when that (moon) wanes, it is being consumed by them.
4	4	16	And when, at full moon, he offers the Agni-Soma (cake) on the first day, he thereby (as it were) extracts that (Soma); and, when extracted, he adds that juice to it, and makes it strong by means of that juice . Whosoever, then, knowing this, prepares the Sânnâyya at full moon, renders his offering palatable to the gods, and his offering is palatable to the gods.
4	4	17	And again as to why, at new moon, he offers the Indra-Agni (cake) on the first day. Indra and Agni doubtless are the deities of the new and full moon: it is to these, therefore, that he offers directly and expressly; and directly to the new and full moon is offering made by him who thus knows this.
4	4	18	And on the morrow there is Agni's cake and Mitra and Varuna's curds. Now Agni's cake is (offered) for the sole purpose that it may not forsake the sacrifice. Mitra and Varuna, on the other hand, are the two half-moons: the waxing one is Varuna, and the waning one is Mitra. During that night (of new moon) these two meet, and when they are thus together he pleases them with that (cake-offering): and, verily, all is pleased with him, all is obtained by him who thus knows this.
4	4	19	In that same night Mitra implants seed in Varuna, and when it (the moon) wanes, then it isproduced from that seed. Now as to why that oblation of curds (payasyâ) to Mitra and Varuna is here exactly analogous (to the Sânnâyya offered at new moon) .
4	4	20	The new moon doubtless is entitled to the Sânnâyya: it is prepared both then and at full moon. Now were he also here (at the full-moon offering) to mix together (the sweet and sour milk), he would commit a repetition and cause a quarrel (between the respective gods) . Having collected that (Soma or moon) from the waters and plants, he causes him to be born from out of the oblations; and on being born from the oblations, he is visible in the western (sky).
4	4	21	It is through union that he produces him: the curds (payasyâ, fem.) are female, and the whey is seed. Now what is produced by union is (produced) properly: hence he thereby produces him by a productive union; and therefore there is an offering of curds.
4	4	22	He then offers the whey  to the (divine) Coursers. Now the Coursers are the seasons, and the whey is seed: and thus the seed is cast properly, and the seasons bring forth the seed so cast in the form of these creatures. This is why he offers the whey to the Coursers.
4	4	23	He offers, as it were, behind the sacrifice: for it is from behind that the male approaches and impregnates the female. He first offers in the east. With 'O Agni, accept . . . !' he repeats the Vashat,--this is in lieu of the Svishtakrit; and (the latter)  he offers in the east.
4	4	24	He then sprinkles (the whey) in the several quarters, with the texts , 'The quarters!--The fore-quarters (pra-dis)!--The by-quarters (â-dis)!--The intermediate quarters (vi-dis)! The upper quarters (ud-dis)!--To the quarters,--Svâhâ !' Five are the quarters, and five theseasons: he thus effects a union between the quarters and the seasons .
4	4	25	Five partake of that (whey remaining in the spoon),--viz. the Hotri, the Adhvaryu, the Brahman, the Âgnîdhra, and the Sacrificer; for five are the seasons, so that the characteristic nature of the seasons is thereby obtained; and the seed that is cast is firmly implanted in the seasons. The sacrificer partakes of it first, thinking, 'May I first obtain seed!' But also last (he partakes of it) , thinking, 'May seed remain in me last of all!' By saying, 'Invited,--invite thou !' they make it (the whey to resemble) the Soma.
5	1	1	Verily, in the beginning, Pragâpati alone existed here . He thought within himself, 'How can I be propagated?' He toiled and practised austerities. He created living beings . The living beings created by him passed away: they are those birds. Now man is the nearest to Pragâpati; and man is two-footed: hence birds are two-footed.
5	1	2	Pragâpati thought within himself, 'Even as formerly I was alone, so also am I now alone.' He created a second (race of beings); they also passed away: they are those small crawling reptiles other than snakes. He created a third (race), they say; they also passed away: they are those snakes. Yâgñavalkya, on his part, declared them to be of two kinds only; but of three kinds they are according to the Rik.
5	1	3	While praising and practising austerities, Pragâpatithought within himself, 'How comes it that the living beings created by me pass away?' He then became aware that his creatures passed away from want of food. He made the breasts in the fore-part of (their) body  teem with milk. He then created living beings; and by resorting to the breasts, the beings created by him thenceforward continued to exist: they are these (creatures) which have not passed away.
5	1	4	Hence it has been said by the Rishi ,.--'Three generations have passed beyond,'--this is said  those that passed away;--'Others settled down around the light (arka, the sun)'--the light doubtless is the fire: those creatures which did not pass away, settled down around the fire; it is with regard to them that this is said.
5	1	5	'The great one (neut.)  remained within the worlds'--it is with regard to Pragâpati that this is said.--'The blower (or, purifier) entered the regions'--the regions doubtless are the quarters, and these were indeed entered by that blowing wind: it is with regard to them that this verse was uttered. And in like manner as Pragâpati created these living beings, so they are propagated: for whenever the breasts of woman and the udder of cattle swell, then whatever is born is born; and by resorting to the breasts these (beings) continue to exist.
5	1	6	Now that milk is indeed food; for in the beginning Pragâpati produced it for food. But thatfood also means living beings (progeny), since it is by food that they exist: by resorting to the breasts of those who have milk, they continue to exist. And those who have no milk are nursed by the former as soon as they are born; and thus they exist by means of food, and hence food means progeny.
5	1	7	He who is desirous of offspring, sacrifices with that oblation, and thereby makes himself the sacrifice, which is Pragâpati .
5	1	8	In the first place  there is a cake for Agni on eight potsherds. Agni indeed is the root, the progenitor of the deities; he is Pragâpati ('lord of creatures'): hence there is a cake for Agni.
5	1	9	Then follows a potful of boiled rice (karu) for Soma. Soma doubtless is seed, and that in Agni, the progenitor; he (Agni) casts the seed Soma: thus there is at the outset a productive union.
5	1	10	Then follows a cake on twelve or eight potsherds  for Savitri. Savitri indeed is the impeller (pra-savitri) of the gods; he is Pragâpati, the intermediate  progenitor: hence the cake to Savitri.
5	1	11	Then follows a potful of boiled rice for Sarasvatî; and another for Pûshan. Sarasvatî doubtless is a woman, and Pûshan is a man: thus there is again a productive union. Through that twofold productive union Pragâpati created the living beings,--through the one (he created) the upright, and through the other those looking to the ground. This is why there are these five oblations .
5	1	12	After that (follows), as a foundation for the curds, a cake on seven potsherds for the Maruts. The Maruts indeed are the people (visah), the people of the gods. They roamed about here entirely unimpeded. Having approached Pragâpati, when he was sacrificing, they said, 'We shall destroy those creatures of thine which thou art about to create by means of this offering .'
5	1	13	Pragâpati reflected, 'My former creatures have passed away; and if those (Maruts) destroy these (creatures), then nothing will be left.' He accordingly set aside for them that share, the Maruts' cake on seven potsherds; and that is this same cake on seven potsherds for the Maruts. The reason why it is one of seven potsherds, is that the host of the Maruts is (distributed in troops) of seven each . This is why there is a cake on seven potsherds for the Maruts.
5	1	14	Let him offer it to the 'self-strong' (Maruts); since they gained that share for themselves. [If], however, they (the priests) do not find an invitatory and an offering prayer (addressed) to the 'self-strong' (Maruts) , let it be (offered) simply to the[paragraph continues] Maruts. It is offered for the safety of creatures: hence it is offered to the Maruts.
5	1	15	Thereupon follows the oblation of curds (payasyâ). Now it is on milk that the creatures subsist, it was by means of milk that they were preserved: hence he now offers to them that by which they were preserved, and whereon they subsist; and the beings whom he creates by means of the foregoing offerings, subsist on that milk, on that oblation of curds.
5	1	16	Therein a union takes place: the curdled milk (payasyâ, fem.) is female, and the whey is seed. From that union the infinite All was gradually generated; and since the infinite All was gradually generated from that union, therefore it (the offering of curds) belongs to the All-gods.
5	1	17	Then follows a cake on one potsherd for Heaven and Earth. Now when Pragâpati had created the living beings by those offerings, he enclosed them within heaven and earth; and so they are now enclosed within heaven and earth. And in like manner he, who by means of those oblations creates living beings, thereby encloses them within heaven and earth: this is why there is a cake on one potsherd for Heaven and Earth.
5	1	18	Now as to the course of proceeding. They do not raise an uttara-vedi  in order that it (the sacred work) may be unobstructed, that it may be entire, that it may be (worthy) of the All-gods.--The barhis is tied up in three (bunches), and thenagain in one ; for such is the characteristic form of generation, since father and mother are a productive (pair), and what is born forms a third element: hence that which is threefold is again (made) one. Thereto flowering shoots (of sacrificial grass) are tied: these he uses for the prastara ; for this is a productive union, and productive indeed are flowering shoots: this is why he takes flowering shoots for the prastara.
5	1	19	On putting the, sacrificial dishes in their place, they churn the fire . For it was after Agni was born that Pragâpati's offspring was born;. and so for this (sacrificer) also offspring is born after Agni (the fire) has been produced: this is why they churn the fire, after they have deposited the sacrificial dishes in their place.
5	1	20	[At the Vaisvadeva-offering] there are nine fore-offerings and nine after-offerings . Now the virâg metre consists of ten syllables: hence, he obtains both times an inferior (incomplete) virâg for the sake of production, because it was from that inferior (lower) source of production  that Pragâpati twice produced creatures--both the upright and those looking to the ground. This is why (the Vaisvadeva) has nine fore-offerings and nine after-offerings.
5	1	21	There are three Samishtayagus ; for this (offering) is decidedly greater than an (ordinary) havir-yagña , since it has nine fore-offerings and nine after-offerings. However, there may also be only a single Samishtayagus, since this is a havir-yagña. The priest's fee for it (consists of) the firstborn calf (of the season).
5	1	22	And what race, what prosperity accrued to Pragâpati from his offering this sacrifice, that same race he produces, that same prosperity he attainswhosoever, knowing this, offers this sacrifice: let him therefore perform this sacrifice.
5	2	1	Now it was by means of the Vaisvadeva that Pragâpati produced living beings. The beings produced by him ate (ghas) Varuna's barley corn; for originally the barley belonged to Varuna. And from their eating Varuna's barley corn the name Varunapraghâsâh (is derived).
5	2	2	Varuna seized them; and on being seized by Varuna, they became rent all over ; and they lay and sat them down breathing in and breathing out. The out-breathing and in-breathing forsook them not, but all the other deities  forsook them; and owing to these two, the creatures did not perish.
5	2	3	Pragâpati healed them by means of that oblation: both the creatures that were born and those that were unborn he delivered from Varuna's noose; and his creatures were born without disease and blemish.
5	2	4	Now when this (sacrificer) performs these offerings in the fourth month (after the Vaisvadeva), he does so either because thus Varuna does not seize his offspring, or because the gods performed (the same offering); and both the children that have been born to him and those that are yet unborn he thereby delivers from Varuna's noose, and his children are born without disease and blemish. This is why he performs these offerings in the fourth month.
5	2	5	At this (sacrifice) there are two altars and two fires . The reason why there are two altars and twofires, is that thereby one frees the creatures from Varuna's noose both ways,--on the one side (he frees) the upright, and on the other those looking to the ground: this is why there are two altars and two fires.
5	2	6	On the northern (uttara) altar he raises the uttara-vedi (upper or north altar), not on the southern one. Varuna, doubtless, is the nobility, and the Maruts are the people: he thus makes the nobility superior (uttara) to the people; and hence people here serve the Kshatriya, placed above them. This is why he raises the uttara-vedi on the northern, not on the southern altar.
5	2	7	In the first place there are those five oblations . For by means of those five oblations Pragâpati produced the creatures, with them he freed the creatures both ways from Varuna's noose,--on the one side (he freed) the upright, and on the other those that tend to the ground: this is why there are those five oblations.
5	2	8	Then follows a cake on twelve potsherds for Indra and Agni. Indra and Agni indeed are the out-breathing and in-breathing: thus this is likedoing a good turn to one who has done him a good turn; for it is owing to these two that his creatures  did not perish. Hence he now restores his creatures by means of the out-breathing and in-breathing, bestows out-breathing and in-breathing on them: this is why there is a cake on twelve potsherds for Indra and Agni.
5	2	9	On both (fires) there is an oblation of curds. It is on milk that the creatures subsist and by means of milk that they were preserved: hence it is with that by which they were preserved and whereon they subsist, that he delivers them both ways from Varuna's noose,--on the one side (he delivers) the upright and on the other those looking to the ground. This is why there is an oblation of curds on both (fires).
5	2	10	The northern one is offered to Varuna, since it was Varuna who seized his (Pragâpati's) creatures: hence he thereby directly delivers them from Varuna's noose. The southern one is offered to the Maruts. It is for the sake of diversity that it is offered to the Maruts; for a repetition he would undoubtedly commit, were he to offer both to Varuna. Moreover, it was from the south that the Maruts intended to slay his (Pragâpati's) creatures, and with that share he propitiated them: for this reason the southern (oblation of curds) belongs to the Maruts.
5	2	11	Upon both (dishes of curds) he scatters karîra-fruits ; for with karîra-fruits Pragâpatibestowed happiness (ka) on the creatures, and so does he (the sacrificer) thereby bestow happiness on the creatures.
5	2	12	Upon both of them he also scatters samî-leaves; for with samî-leaves Pragâpati bestowed bliss (sam) on the creatures, and so does he now thereby bestow bliss on the creatures.
5	2	13	Then follows a cake on one potsherd for Ka (Pragâpati); for by that cake on one potsherd to Ka Pragâpati indeed bestowed happiness (ka) on the creatures, and so does he (the sacrificer) now bestow happiness on the creatures by that one-cup cake: this is why there is a cake on one potsherd for Ka.
5	2	14	And on the first day, after husking and slightly roasting barley on the Dakshinâgni, they prepare therewith as many dishes of karambha  as there are members of the (sacrificer's) family, exceeded by one.
5	2	15	At the same time they also prepare a ram and a ewe; and if he be able to procure wool other than from edaka sheep, let him wash it and stick it on both the ram and the ewe; but should he not be able to procure wool other than from edaka sheep, tufts of kusa grass may also be (used).
5	2	16	The reason why there are a ram and a ewe is chat the ram manifestly is Varuna's victim, so that he thereby manifestly delivers the creatures from Varuna's noose. They are made of barley, because it was when they (the creatures) had eaten barley that Varuna seized them. A pair they form, so that hedelivers the creatures from Varuna's noose through conjugal union.
5	2	17	The ewe he places on the southern, and the ram on the northern dish of curds; for in this way alone a proper union is effected, since the woman lies on the left (or north) side of the man.
5	2	18	The Adhvaryu places all the (other) sacrificial dishes upon the northern altar; and the Pratiprasthâtri places on the southern altar that dish of curds (belonging to the Maruts).
5	2	19	Having thus placed the sacrificial dishes, he churns the fire; and having churned it and placed it on (the hearth) , he offers thereon, The Adhvaryu in the first place says (to the Hotri) , 'Recite to the fire that is being kindled!' Both (the Adhvaryu and the Pratiprasthâtri) then put firewood on (the fire) and both reserve one kindling-stick each; and they both pour out the first libation (âghâra). Thereupon the Adhvaryu says, 'Agnîdh, trim the fire!' Although the summons is given, the trimming does not take place (immediately)
5	2	20	Thereupon the Pratiprasthâtri returns (to where the sacrificer's wife is seated). When he is about to lead the wife away, he asks her, 'Withwhom holdest thou intercourse?' Now when a woman who belongs to one (man) carries on intercourse with another, she undoubtedly commits (a sin) against Varuna. He therefore thus asks her, lest she should sacrifice with a secret pang in her mind; for when confessed the sin becomes less, since it becomes truth; this is why he thus asks her. And whatever (connection) she confesses  not, that indeed will turn out injurious to her relatives.
5	2	21	He then makes her say the text , 'We invoke the Maruts, the voracious consumers of enemies, delighting in their porridge.' This (verse) is (of like import) as the invitatory prayer she therewith invites them to these dishes .
5	2	22	Of these (dishes) there is one for each descendant; as many (children) as there are in the (sacrificer's) family, so many (dishes) there are, exceeded by one. There being one for each descendant, he thereby delivers from Varuna's noose one by one the children born to him; and there being an additional one, he thereby delivers from Varuna'snoose those children of his that are as yet unborn: this is why there are (the same number of dishes) exceeded by one.
5	2	23	(In the form of) dishes they are, because it is from dishes that food is eaten; and of barley they are prepared, because it was when they (the creatures) had eaten the barley corn that Varuna seized them. From the winnowing basket she offers, because food is prepared by means of the winnowing basket. The wife offers (together with her husband): thus he delivers his offspring from Varuna's noose through conjugal union.
5	2	24	She offers previously to the sacrifice, previously to the oblations, since the people do not eat offerings, and the Maruts are the people. Now when Pragâpati's creatures, being seized by Varuna, became rent all over, and sat and lay them down, breathing in and breathing out, then the Maruts destroyed their sin; and so do the Maruts now destroy the sin of his (the sacrificer's) offspring. This is why she offers previously to the sacrifice, previously to the oblations.
5	2	25	He  offers in the southern fire, with the text , 'Whatever (sin we have committed) in the village and forest,'--for both in the village and in the forest sin is committed;--'whatever in society and in our own self,'--by 'whatever (we have committed) in society,' he means to say 'against man;' and by 'whatever in our own self' (indriya), he means to say 'against the gods;'--'whatever sinwe have here committed, that we expiate by offering, Svâhâ!'--whereby he says 'whatsoever sin we have committed, from all that we rid ourselves.'
5	2	26	Thereupon he mutters the (verse) addressed to Indra and referring to the Maruts.--Now when the Maruts destroyed the sin of Pragâpati's creatures, he thought within himself, 'I hope they will not destroy my creatures.'
5	2	27	He muttered that (verse) addressed to Indra and referring to the Maruts. Indra indeed is the nobility, and the Maruts are the people; and the nobility are the controllers of the people: 'They shall be controlled,' he thought; and therefore  is addressed to Indra.
5	2	28	'Let there not, O Indra, be (fight) for us here in battles with the gods, since there is a share for thee in the sacrifice, O fiery one!--for thee, the mighty showerer of gifts, whose Maruts the song of the offerer stream-like celebrates.'
5	2	29	He then makes her say the text , 'The men skilled in the work have done the work,'--those skilled in the work have indeed done the work;--'with pleasing song;'--for with song they have done it. 'Having done the work for the gods;'--for the gods indeed they have done the work; 'go home, ye companions!'--they are now together with her while she is led thither from an other place: hence she says, 'ye companions' (sakâbhû, 'being together'). 'Go home,' she says, because that wife doubtless is the hind part of the sacrifice, and he has just now made her take her seat to the east of the sacrifice. 'Home' doubtless means the house, and the house is a resting-place: hence he thereby makes her rest in that resting-place, the house.
5	2	30	Having led her back (to her seat) the Pratiprasthâtri returns (to his place by the side of the southern altar). They now trim the fire . When the fire has been trimmed, both (the Adhvaryu and Pratiprasthâtri) make the second libation (of butter). Thereupon the Adhvaryu, having called (on the Âgnîdhra) for the 'Sraushat,' chooses the Hotri. The chosen Hotri then seats himself on the Hotri's seat beside the northern altar; and having seated himself, he urges (the Adhvaryu and Pratiprasthâtri) to proceed. Being thus urged to proceed, they both take up the spoons and step across (to the south side of the fires). After stepping across and calling for the 'Sraushat,' the Adhvaryu says (to the Hotri), 'Pronounce the offering-prayer on the kindling-sticks!' and 'Pronounce the offering-prayer!' at each (subsequent fore-offering). Pouring (the butter in the spoons) together (into the guhû) at the fourth , they both proceed with the nine fore-offerings .
5	2	31	Thereupon the Adhvaryu says (to the Hotri),[paragraph continues] 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni!' referring to Agni's butter-portion . Both (the Adhvaryu and Pratiprasthâtri) having taken four 'cuttings' of butter, they step across (to the north side of their respective fires). Having stepped across and called for the 'Sraushat,' the Adhvaryu says (to the Hotri), 'Pronounce the offering-formula to Agni!' After the 'Vashat' has been uttered, they both pour out the oblation.
5	2	32	The Adhvaryu then says, 'Pronounce (the invitatory prayer) to Soma!' referring to Soma's butter-portion. Both having taken four cuttings of butter, they step across. Having stepped across and called for the 'Sraushat,' the Adhvaryu says (to the Hotri), 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to Soma!' After the 'Vashat' has been uttered, they both pour out the oblation.
5	2	33	Thus whatever has to be done by speech, that the Adhvaryu does, and not the Pratiprasthâtri. Now as to why the Adhvaryu alone calls for the 'Sraushat.' Here indeed when the 'Vashat' is pronounced,
5	2	34	The Pratiprasthâtri is merely the imitator of what is done (by the Adhvaryu). For Varuna is the nobility, and the Maruts are the people: hence he thereby makes the people the imitators, the followers of the nobility. But were the Pratiprasthâtri also to call for the 'Sraushat,' he would doubtless make the people equal in power to the nobility: for this reason the Pratiprasthâtri does not call for the 'Sraushat.'
5	2	35	The Pratiprasthâtri sits down, after taking the two offering-spoons in his hand. The Adhvaryu thenproceeds with those oblations,--viz. Agni's cake on eight potsherds, Soma's pap, Savitri's cake on twelve or eight potsherds, Sarasvatî's pap, Pûshan's pap, and Indra and Agni's cake on twelve potsherds.
5	2	36	Thereupon, being about to proceed with those two oblations of curds, (the Adhvaryu and Pratiprasthâtri) exchange (the ram and ewe): the ram which was on the Maruts' (dish of curds) he (the Adhvaryu) places on that of Varuna; and the ewe which was on Varuna's (dish of curds) he (the Pratiprasthâtri) places on that of the Maruts. Now the reason why they make this exchange, is this,--Varuna is the nobility, and the male represents energy: hence they thereby bestow energy on the nobility. The female, on the other hand, is without energy; and the Maruts are the people: hence they thereby cause the people to be without energy. This is why they make this exchange.
5	2	37	The Adhvaryu now says (to the Hotri), 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Varuna!' He then pours an 'under-layer' of butter (into the guhû), takes two cuttings from Varuna's curds, and with either of the two cuttings puts the rant (in the spoon). He then pours butter thereon, replenishes (the place whence) the two cuttings (have been made), and steps across (to the south side of the fire). After stepping across and calling for the 'Sraushat,' he says (to the Hotri), 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to Varuna!' and, on the 'Vashat' being uttered, he pours out the oblation.
5	2	38	Thereupon the Adhvaryu takes both spoons in his left hand; and taking hold of the Pratiprasthâtri's garment, says (to the Hotri), 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to the Maruts!' The[paragraph continues] Pratiprasthâtri then makes an 'under-layer' of butter (in his guhû and two cuttings from the curds of the Maruts, and with either of the two cuttings puts the ewe (in the spoon). He then pours butter thereon, replenishes (the place of) the two cuttings, and steps across (to the south of the fire). The Adhvaryu, having called for the 'Sraushat,' says (to the Hotri), 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the Maruts!' and on the 'Vashat' being uttered, (the Pratiprasthâtri) he pours out the oblation.
5	2	39	The Adhvaryu then proceeds with the cake on eleven potsherds for Ka; and having made that offering, he says, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni Svishtakrit (" the maker of good offering")!' The Adhvaryu then takes cuttings from all (his) oblations, one from each; and the Pratiprasthâtri also takes one cutting from that oblation of curds (to the Maruts). They then pour twice butter upon (the portions), and step across (to the south side of the fires). On stepping across and calling for the 'Sraushat,' the Adhvaryu says, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to Agni Svishtakrit; and after the (concluding) 'Vashat,' they both pour out the oblation.
5	2	40	The Adhvaryu now cuts off the fore-portion. Having then cut off the Idâ piece by piece, he hands it to the Pratiprasthâtri; and the Pratiprasthâtri puts thereon two cuttings from the Maruts' curds. He (the Adhvaryu) then pours twice butter thereon. After invoking (the Idâ), they cleanse themselves .
5	2	41	Thereupon the Adhvaryu says, 'O Brahman, shall I step forward?' Having put on the (remaining) kindling-stick  he says, Agnîdh, trim the fire![paragraph continues] He, the Adhvaryu, then pours the clotted butter  (in the prishadâgya-upabhrit) into the two spoons (the guhû and upabhrit); and the Pratiprasthâtri also, if he have any clotted butter, divides it into two parts and pours it (into the two spoons); but if there is no clotted butter, he divides the butter in the upabhrit in two parts and pours them out separately. Then both step across (to the south side of the fires). The Adhvaryu, having stepped across and called for the 'Sraushat,' says (to the Hotri), 'Pronounce the offering-formula to the gods!' and, 'Pronounce the offering-formula!' at each (subsequent after-offering). Thus they both perform the nine after-offerings , pouring together (the butter from the spoons) at the (or at every) fourth after-offering. The reason why there are nine fore-offerings and nine after-offerings, is that he thereby delivers the creatures both times from Varuna's noose,--by the former (he delivers) the upright and by the latter those looking to the ground: for this reason there are nine fore-offerings and nine after-offerings.
5	2	42	They both then separate the spoons , after laying them (on the altars). Having separated the spoons, and anointed the enclosing-sticks; and having thereupon taken hold of the (middle) enclosing-stick,and called for the (Âgnîdhra's) 'Sraushat,' the Adhvaryu thus addresses (the Hotri) , 'The divine Hotris are summoned for the proclamation of success; the human is called upon for the song of praise!' The Hotri then intones the song of praise (sûktavâka). Thereupon both seize their prastara-bunches and throw them (into the fires); both take a single straw each therefrom and remain sitting by (the fires); when the Hotri recites the song of praise,--
5	2	43	The Âgnîdhra says, 'Throw after!' Both (the Adhvaryu and Pratiprasthâtri) throw (the stalk) after (the prastara); and both touch themselves.
5	2	44	He (the Âgnîdhra) then says , 'Discourse (with me)!' [The Adhvaryu asks,] 'Has he gone (to the gods), Agnîdh? He has gone!'--'Bid (the gods) hear!'--'Yea, may (one) hear!'--'Goodspeed to the divine Hotris! Success to the human!'---The Adhvaryu also (afterwards)  says (to the Hotri), 'Pronounce the "All-hail and blessing!"' They both throw the enclosing-sticks (into the fire); and after taking up the spoons together, they both place them on the wooden sword .
5	2	45	Thereupon the Adhvaryu returns (to the Gârhapatya fire) and performs the Patnîsamyâgas . The Pratiprasthâtri, in the meantime,remains waiting. After performing the Patnîsamyâgas, the Adhvaryu steps up (to the northern fire).
5	2	46	He (the Adhvaryu) performs the three Samishtayagus (with the respective texts) ; the Pratiprasthâtri takes up his spoon (and performs those oblations) silently.--The same garments, worn by the sacrificer and his wife at the Vaisvadeva, should be put on also on this occasion. They now take (the havis) mixed with the burnt scrapings of the Varuna curds, and betake themselves to (the place of) the expiatory bath (avabhritha). This (ablution) stands in relation to Varuna, (being performed) with a view to deliverance from Varuna's power. No Sâman-hymn is sung on this occasion, for at this (sacrifice) nothing whatever is performed with a Sâman-hymn. Having silently walked thither and entered (the water), he (the Adhvaryu) immerses (the vessel containing the scrapings).
5	2	47	With the text , 'O laving bath, laving thou glidest along: with the help of the gods may I wipe out the sin committed against the gods, and with the help of mortals the sin committed against mortals! Preserve me, O God, from injury from the fiercely-howling (demon)!' Those (garments worn while bathing)  he may giveto whichever (priest) he chooses, since they are not the garments of an initiated person. Even as a snake casts its skin, so does he cast away all his sin.
5	2	48	Thereupon they shave (the sacrificer's) hair and beard; and take up the two fires ,--for only after changing his place (to the ordinary sacrificial ground) he performs that (other) sacrifice , since it is not proper that he should perform the Agnihotra on the uttaravedi: for this reason he changes his place. Having gone to the house  and 'churned out' the fires, he performs the full-moon offering. These seasonal offerings doubtless are detached sacrifices; whereas the full-moon offering is a regular, established sacrifice: hence he finally establishes himself by means of that regular sacrifice; and therefore he changes his place (to the ordinary sacrificial ground).
5	3	1	Verily, by means of the Varunapraghâsâh Pragâpati delivered the creatures from Varuna's noose; and those creatures of his were born without disease and blemish. Now with these Sâkamedha offerings,--therewith indeed the gods slew Vritra, therewith they gained that supreme authority which they now wield; and so does he now therewith slay his wicked, spiteful enemy and gain the victory: this is why he performs these offerings in the fourth month (after the Varunapraghâsâh). He performs them on two successive days.
5	3	2	On the first day he offers a cake on eight potsherds to Agni Anîkavat . For it was aftershaping Agni into a sharp point , that the gods rushed forward, intent on slaying Vritra; and that sharp point, Agni, swerved not. And so does he (the Sacrificer) now rush forward, after shaping Agni into a sharp point, intent on slaying his wicked, spiteful enemy; and that sharp point, Agni, swerves not: this is why he sacrifices to Agni Anîkavat.
5	3	3	Thereupon, at midday, he offers a potful of boiled grain (karu) to the Maruts, the Scorchers (Sântapanâh), for at midday indeed the scorching winds scorched Vritra; and thus scorched he lay panting and gasping, being rent all over. And so do the scorching winds scorch his (the Sacrificer's) wicked, spiteful enemy: hence (he sacrifices) to the Maruts, the Scorchers.
5	3	4	Thereupon, (in the evening, he offers a potful of boiled grain) to the Maruts, the Householders (Grihamedhinah). That pap he cooks after drivingaway the calves (from the cows) with the (palâsa-) branch, and having (all the cows) milked into the pot containing the strainers. Now, whenever (in preparing the pap) they use (whole) rice-grains, then that is a karu: this nourishment  the gods took when they were about to slay Vritra on the morrow; and so does he (the Sacrificer) now take that nourishment, being about to slay his wicked, spiteful enemy. The reason, then, why it is milk-pap, is that milk is nourishment, and rice-grains are nourishment, and that he thus puts into him (âtman) that twofold nourishment. For this reason it is a rice-pap (prepared) with milk.
5	3	5	The practice, in regard to this (pap, is as follows). The same altar covered (with sacrificial grass) which served for the (oblation to) the Maruts, the Scorchers, is (now used) . Near this covered altar they lay down the enclosing-sticks and pieces of wood. Having had (the cows) milked in the same way (as before), he (the Adhvaryu) cooks the pap; and having cooked it and basted it with butter, he removes it from the fire.
5	3	6	They then rinse either two plates or two dishes, and put that (pap) thereon in two equalparts. Having then made a hollow in each (pap), he (the Adhvaryu) pours clarified butter therein, and wipes both the dipping-spoon and the offering-spoon. Thereupon he takes the two dishes of pap, and walks up (to the altar); and again, he takes the dipping and offering spoons, and walks up; and having touched  the covered altar, and laid the enclosing-sticks round (the fire) , he puts on as many pieces of firewood as he thinks fit. He then deposits those two dishes of pap, and the dipping and offering spoons, in their places (outside the altar). The Hotri sits down on the Hotri's seat. Taking the dipping and offering spoons, he (the Adhvaryu) says,--
5	3	7	'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni!' with reference to Agni's butter-portion. He then takes four 'cuttings' of butter from the hollow of the southern pap, and steps over (to the south side of the fire). Having stepped over, and called for the (Âgnîdhra's) 'Sraushat,' he says (to the Hotri), 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to Agni!' and pours out the oblation, as soon as the Vashat has been uttered.
5	3	8	He then says, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Soma!' with reference to Soma's butter-portion. He then takes four cuttings of butter from the hollow of the northern pap, and steps over. Having stepped over and called for the 'Sraushat,' he says, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to Soma!' and pours out the oblation, as soon as the Vashat has been uttered.
5	3	9	He then says, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayerto the Maruts, the Householders!' He makes an 'under-layer' of butter (in the offering-spoon) from the hollow of the southern pap, takes two cuttings from the latter, pours some butter thereon, and steps across. Having stepped across and called for the 'Sraushat,' he says, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the Maruts, the Householders!' and pours out the oblation as soon as the Vashat has been uttered.
5	3	10	He then says, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni Svishtakrit !' He makes an under-layer of butter from the hollow of the northern pap, takes two cuttings from the latter, pours some butter thereon, and steps across. Having stepped across and called for the 'Sraushat,' he says, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to Agni Svishtakrit!' and pours out the oblation as soon as the Vashat has been uttered. Thereupon he cuts off the Idâ , but no fore-portion . Having invoked (the Idâ), they cleanse themselves. This is one mode of performance.
5	3	11	Then there is this other. The same altar covered (with sacrificial grass) which has served for the Maruts, the Scorchers, is (used now). Near this covered altar they lay down the enclosing-sticks and pieces of firewood; and having had (the cows) milked in the same way (as before) he cooks the rice-pap. The butter he puts on so as to be no mere accessory  Having cooked (the pap) and bastedit, and removed it (from the fire), he anoints it. He then removes the butter in the pot (from the fire), and wipes the dipping and offering spoons. Thereupon, taking the dish with the pap, he walks up (to the altar); and again, taking the butter in the pot, he walks up; and again, taking the dipping and offering spoons, he walks up (to the altar). He then touches that covered altar, lays the enclosing-sticks round (the Âhavanîya fire), and puts on as many pieces of wood as he thinks fit. He then deposits successively  (in their respective places) the dish with the pap, the pot with butter, and the dipping and offering spoons. The Hotri sits down in the Hotri's seat. Taking the dipping and offering spoons, he (the Adhvaryu) says,--
5	3	12	'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni!' with a view to (offering) Agni's butter-portion. He then takes four 'cuttings' of butter from the pot and steps across (to the offering-place on the south side of the fire). Having stepped across and called for the (Âgnîdhra's) Sraushat, he says (to the Hotri), 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to Agni!' and pours out the oblation, as soon as the Vashat has been uttered.
5	3	13	He then says, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Soma!' with a view to Soma's butter-portion. He then takes four cuttings of butter from the pot, and steps across. Having steppedacross, and called for the Sraushat, he says, 'Pronounce the offering-formula to Soma!' and pours out the oblation, as soon as the Vashat has been uttered.
5	3	14	Thereupon he says, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to the Maruts, the Householders!' He then makes an 'under-layer' of butter (in the guhû), takes two cuttings from that pap, pours some butter thereon, re-anoints (replenishes with butter the parts of the sacrificial dish from which he has made)  the two cuttings, and steps across (to the offering-place). Having stepped across and called for the Sraushat, he says, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the Maruts, the Householders!' and pours out the oblation, as soon as the Vashat has been uttered.
5	3	15	Thereupon he says, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni Svishtakrit!' He then makes an under-layer of butter, takes one cutting from the pap, pours twice butter thereon, without, however, re-anointing the (place of the) cutting; and steps across. Having stepped across, and called for the Sraushat, he says, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to Agni Svishtakrit!' and pours out the oblation, as soon as the Vashat has been uttered.
5	3	16	, He then cuts off the Idâ, but no fore-portion. Having invoked (the Idâ), they (the priests) eat it. As many members of (the sacrificer's) household as are entitled to partake of the remains of sacrificialfood  may eat (of the pap); or the officiating priests may eat it; or, if there be abundant pap, other Brâhmans also may eat of it. The pot having then been covered, before it is quite emptied, they put it away in a safe place, for the 'full-spoon ceremony.' Thereupon they let the calves together with their mothers; and thus the cattle take that nourishment. That night he performs the Agnihotra with rice-gruel. In the morning they milk a cow, which suckles an adopted calf , for the purpose of the offering to the fathers.
5	3	17	Thereupon, in the morning, either after or before the performance of the Agnihotra--whichever he pleases--he cuts out (the remaining rice-pap) with the darvi-spoon  from the un-emptied pot, with the text , 'Full, O spoon, fly away, well filled fly back to us![paragraph continues] O thou (Indra), of a hundredfold powers, let us two barter food and drink, like wares!' In like manner as an invitatory prayer (is used at offerings) so does he by this (verse) invite him (Indra) to that share.
5	3	18	Let him then tell (the Sacrificer) to make a bull roar. 'If it roars,' say some, 'then that (sound) is the Vashat; let him offer after that Vashat.' And in this way indeed he calls Indra in his own form to the slaying of Vritra ; for the bull is indeed Indra's form: hence he thereby calls Indra in his own form to the slaying of Vritra. If it roars, then one may know that Indra has come to his sacrifice, that his sacrifice is with Indra. And should it not roar, let the priest, seated on the south side (viz. the Brahman), say, 'Sacrifice!'--this, indeed, is Indra's voice.
5	3	19	He offers with the text , 'Give unto me, (and) I give unto thee. Bestow (gifts) on me, (and) I bestow on thee ! And mayest thou give me guerdon, (and) I will give thee guerdon! Svâhâ!'
5	3	20	He then offers a cake on seven potsherds to the sportive (Krîdinah) Maruts. For when Indra went forward in order to slay Vritra, the sportive Maruts were sporting around him singing his praises; and even so do they sport around this (Sacrificer), singing his praises, now that he is about to slay his wicked, spiteful enemy: thisis why (he sacrifices) to the sportive Maruts . Thereupon (follows the performance) of the Great Oblation (Mahâ-havis): this (performance) is in accordance with that of the great (seasonable) oblation .
5	4	1	Verily, by means of the Great Oblation the gods slew Vritra ; by means of it they gained that supreme authority which they now wield; and so does he (the Sacrificer) thereby now slay his wicked, spiteful enemy, and gain the victory: this is why he performs this sacrifice.
5	4	2	The mode of its performance (is as follows): They raise an uttara-vedi ; they use clotted butter ; and they churn the fire. There are ninefore-offerings and nine after-offerings , and three Samishtayagus. In the first place there are those five oblations .
5	4	3	Now as to why there is a cake on eight potsherds for Agni. With Agni, (shaped into) a sharp point (tegas) , indeed, they (the gods) slew him (Vritra); and Agni, that sharp point, swerved not: hence there is (a cake) for Agni.
5	4	4	Then as to why there is a rice-pap for Soma. With the aid of Soma, the king, indeed they slew him, they who have Soma for their king: hence there is a pap for Soma.
5	4	5	Then as to why there is a cake on twelve, or eight , potsherds for Savitri. Savitri, indeed, is the impeller (prasavitri) of the gods; and impelled by Savitri they slew him: hence there is (a cake) for Savitri.
5	4	6	Then as to why there is a rice-pap for Sarasvatî. Sarasvatî in truth is Speech; and Speech indeed it was that cheered them up, saying, 'Strike! slay !' Hence there is a pap for Sarasvatî.
5	4	7	Then as to why there is a rice-pap for Pûshan. Pûshan doubtless is this earth , and thisearth, indeed, gave him (Vritra) up to slaughter; and they slew him, thus given up by her: hence there is a rice-pap for Pûshan.
5	4	8	Then follows a cake on twelve, potsherds for Indra and Agni; for by means of that they slew him, since Agni means fiery glow (tegas), and Indra means manly power, and by means of these two powers they did indeed slay him. Moreover, Agni is the priesthood, and Indra is the nobility; having allied these two, having closely united the priesthood with the nobility, they (the gods) slew him by means of these two powers: hence there is a cake on twelve potsherds for Indra and Agni.
5	4	9	Then follows a rice-part for Mahendra. For before the slaying of Vritra he was indeed Indra; but after slaying Vritra he became Mahendra (the great Indra), even as (a king becomes) a mahârâga, after obtaining the victory: hence there is a rice-pap for Mahendra. And thereby indeed he renders him great (strong), for the slaying of Vritra: for this reason also there is a rice-pap for Mahendra.
5	4	10	Then follows a cake on one potsherd for Visvakarman. To the gods, indeed, on performing the Sâkamedha-sacrifice and obtaining the victory (over Vritra), that sacred work (karman) was made complete (visva), and all was conquered; and so is that sacred work made complete, and all is conquered, by him who has performed the Sâkamedha-sacrifice and obtained the victory: hence there is a cake on one potsherd for Visvakarman.
5	4	11	And, verily, by performing this sacrifice the gods became what race, what prosperity of the gods there now is; and that same race he propagates,that same prosperity he attains, whosoever, knowing this, performs this sacrifice. Let him therefore perform this sacrifice.
6	1	1	Verily, by means of the Great Oblation the gods slew Vritra, and gained that supreme authority which they now wield. And by means of the sacrifice to the fathers they then recalled to life those of them that had been slain in this battle; and they, indeed, were the fathers: hence the name Pitriyagña  (sacrifice to the Manes).
6	1	2	Now the spring, the summer, and the rainy season,--they are those who vanquished (Vritra); and the autumn, the winter, and the dewy season,--they are those whom they (the gods) recalled to life .
6	1	3	Now when he performs that sacrifice, he does so, hoping that thus they (the Asuras) will not slay any of his, or because the gods did so (perform it). Moreover he thereby offers to those (fathers) the share which the gods assigned to them; and thus he gratifies those whom the gods recalled to life, and leads his own fathers up to a better world; and whatever injury or loss he suffers through his own unrighteous conduct (or wrong sacrificial performance)  that is thereby made good to him: that is why he performs this sacrifice (to the fathers).
6	1	4	He offers a cake on six potsherds to the Pitarah Somavantah, or to Soma Pitrimat . Six doubtless are the seasons, and the fathers are the seasons: hence it is one of six potsherds.
6	1	5	Thereupon they parch barley-grain on the Anvâhâryapakana (or Dakshinâgni) for the Pitaro Barhishadah . They then grind one half of it; and (the other) half remains thus unground,--this is the parched grain for the Barhis-seated fathers.
6	1	6	Then a porridge is (prepared) for the Pitaro ’gnishvâttâh  (by the ground half of the parched grain) being mixed with the milk of a cow suckling an adopted calf, by stirring it once with a single splinter. It is indeed once for all that the fathers have departed, and hence is stirred but once. These are the oblations.
6	1	7	Now those (fathers) who have sacrificed with Soma are the Pitarah Somavantah; and those who gain the world (of the gods) by means of cooked (sacrificial food) offered by them are the Pitaro Barhishadah; and they who (have offered) neither the one nor the other, and whom Agni consumes by burning, they are the Pitaro ’gnishvâttâh. These, then, are the fathers .
6	1	8	He takes out [the rice for] that cake of six potsherds, while seated behind the Gârhapatya, and looking southwards, with the sacrificial cord over his right shoulder. From thence he rises andthreshes (the rice), while standing north of the Dakshina-fire, with his face towards the south. He cleans it but once ; since it is once for all that the fathers have departed.
6	1	9	He places the two mill-stones on (the black antelope skin, so as to be inclined) towards the south ; and puts the six potsherds on the south part of the Gârhapatya hearth. The reason why they keep the southern direction is because that is the region of the fathers: this is why they keep the southern direction.
6	1	10	Thereupon he raises a square altar south of the Dakshinâgni . He makes the corners point towards the intermediate quarters. There are doubtless four intermediate quarters, and the fathers are the intermediate quarters: this is why he makes the corners point towards the intermediate quarters.
6	1	11	In the centre of this (altar) he lays down the fire. From the east, indeed, the gods came westwards to the men: hence one offers to them while standingwith his face towards the east. On all sides are the fathers, for the fathers are the intermediate regions, and the intermediate regions are indeed on all sides: this is why he lays down the fire in the centre.
6	1	12	From thence he throws the grass-bush (stambayagus) eastwards . Having thrown away the grass-bush, he first encloses (the altar) thus (viz. on the west side), then thus (viz. on the north side), then thus (on the east side). Having enclosed it with the first line of enclosure, he (the Adhvaryu) draws (three) lines (across the altar)  and [the Âgnîdhra] removes (from them the dust) which has to be removed. In the same way he encloses it with the second line of enclosure; and having enclosed it with the second line of enclosure, and smoothed it down, he says, 'Place the sprinkling water on (the altar)!' They accordingly place the sprinkling water on (the altar); and the firewood and barhis they lay down beside it . He (the Âgnîdhra) wipes the spoons. He then walks up (to the altar) with the butter (andputs it down thereon , north of the sprinkling water). He (the Adhvaryu) takes butter, while 'sacrificially-invested .'
6	1	13	Here now they say, 'Let him take butter in the upabhrit (by) twice (ladling with the dipping spoon); since there are two after-offerings  at this (sacrifice).' Let him, nevertheless, ladle eight times into the upabhrit: let him do so, lest he should depart from the manner of the sacrifice. After ladling out butter, and shifting his cord back to the right shoulder,--
6	1	14	The Adhvaryu takes the lustral water, and sprinkles first the firewood, and then the altar . Thereupon they hand the sacrificial grass  to him, and he puts it down (on the altar) with the knot to the east. Having thereupon sprinkled it andpoured out (the lustral water on the lower ends of the grass-stalks), and untied the knot, he (at once) seizes the knot, not the prastara ;--it is once for all that the fathers have departed: hence he does not take the prastara.
6	1	15	After undoing the band, he moves thrice  round from right to left, spreading the sacrificial grass all over (the altar); while spreading it all over from right to left in three layers, he reserves as much as may serve for the prastara-bunch. He then moves again thrice round (the altar) from left to right. The reason why he again moves thrice round from left to right, is that, while the first time he went away from here after those three ancestors of his, he now cones back again from them to this, his own world: that is why he again moves thrice round from left to right.
6	1	16	He lays the enclosing-sticks along (the fire, with their tops) towards the south ; and the prastara also he spreads (with the grass-tops) towards the south; nor does he lay down the two vidhritis between (the barhis and the prastara). Once for all the fathers have departed from hence: therefore he lays no vidhritis between.
6	1	17	Thereon he lays the guhû, and east of it (on the barhis) the upabhrit. Having then put down the dhruvâ, the cake, the parched grain, and the porridge (each east of the preceding one), he touches the oblations.
6	1	18	All of them having now become 'sacrificially-invested,' the Sacrificer and Brahman (being) thus (invested) walk round (from the east, along the south) to the west side; and the Âgnîdhra (from the west) to the east side (of the fire) .
6	1	19	They perform this (sacrifice) in a low voice. Secret, indeed, are the fathers, and secret also is (what is spoken) in a low voice: hence they perform (the offering) in a low voice.
6	1	20	They perform it in an enclosed place. Secret, indeed, are the fathers, and secret also is that which is enclosed: hence they perform in an enclosed place.
6	1	21	While putting firewood (on the fire), he then says (to the Hotri), 'Recite to the fire, as it is being kindled!' Only (this) one kindling-verse the Hotri recites , (and that) thrice;--the fathers have departed once for all: hence the Hotri recites thrice only one kindling-verse.
6	1	22	He recites, 'Loving we deposit thee (O Agni), loving we enkindle thee: O loving one, bringhither the loving fathers to eat their oblation!' Thereupon he says, 'Bring Agni hither ! bring Soma hither! bring hither the fathers, accompanied by Soma! bring hither the fathers, seated on the barhis! bring hither the fathers, consumed by Agni! bring hither the butter-drinking gods! bring hither Agni for the Hotriship! bring hither (thine) own greatness !' Having thus called on (Agni) to bring hither (the fathers and gods), he sits down.
6	1	23	Having then called  for the (Âgnîdhra's) 'Sraushat,' he does not elect the Hotri; for this being a sacrifice to the Manes, he does not elect the Hotri , lest he should consign the Hotri to the Manes. He says, 'Hotri, seat thyself!' and takes his seat. The Hotri, having sat down on the Hotri's seat, urges (the Adhvaryu) to proceed; and thus urged, the Adhvaryu takes the two spoons and steps across to the west (of the fire); and having stepped across and called for the 'Sraushat,' he says, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the kindling-sticks!' He performs four fore-offerings ,omitting the one to the Barhis; for the barhis means offspring, and he therefore performs the four fore-offerings without the one to the barhis, lest he should consign his offspring to the fathers. Thereupon they proceed with the two butter-portions; and having offered the two butter-portions,--
6	1	24	They all shift their sacrificial cord over to the right shoulder, being now about to proceed with those (chief) oblations. The Sacrificer and Brahman, (being) thus (invested), step across (from the west) to the east side, and the Âgnîdhra (from the east) to the west side (of the fire). And furthermore, the (Adhvaryu's) call for the 'Sraushat' is 'Õm svadhâ!' and the (Âgnîdhra's) response is 'Astu svadhâ !' and the Vashat-call is 'Svadhâ namah!'
6	1	25	As to this, Âsuri said, 'Let them call for the Sraushat (by "Õ Srâvaya"), and let them respond with the "(Astu) Sraushat," and let them pronounce the "Vashat," lest we should depart from the manner of the sacrifice.'
6	1	26	[The Adhvaryu] then says, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to the fathers, accompanied by Soma!' or '--to Soma, accompanied by the fathers'!--Two invitatory prayers he (the Hotri) pronounces (at the offerings), because it is with one that one moves the gods, and with two the fathers, since the fathers have departed once (for all) : hence he pronounces two invitatory prayers.
6	1	27	[The Adhvaryu] makes an 'under-layer' of butter (in the guhû or offering-spoon). He then cuts a piece from the cake, and together therewith some of the parched grain and the porridge . This he puts down at the same time (in the guhû); makes two sprinklings of butter thereon; and re-anoints (replenishes with butter, the parts of the sacrificial dishes from which he has made) the cuttings. He does not walk over (to the south side of the fire); but having risen and stepped up (to the fire) on the same side (where he was seated), and called (on the Âgnîdhra) for the 'Sraushat,' he says (to the Hotri), 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the fathers, accompanied by Soma!' and pours the oblation (into the fire) as soon as the Vashat  has been uttered.
6	1	28	Thereupon he says, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to the fathers, seated on the barhis!' He then makes an under-layer of butter, takes a 'cutting' from (the north part of) the parched grain, and together therewith some of the porridge and the cake; puts down all this at the same time (in the guhû); makes two sprinklings of butter thereon, and re-anoints (the places of) the cuttings. He does not walk across; but having stepped up (to the fire) on the same side and called for the 'Sraushat,' he says, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the fathers, seated on the barhis!' and pours out the oblation as soon as the Vashat has been uttered.
6	1	29	Thereupon he says, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to the fathers, consumed by the fire!' He then makes an under-layer of butter, takes a cutting from (the south part of) the porridge, and therewith some of the cake and the parched grains; puts down all this at the same time (in the guhû); makes two sprinklings of butter thereon, and re-anoints (the places of) the cuttings. He does not walk across; but having stepped up (to the fire) on the same side, and called for the 'Sraushat,' he says, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the fathers, consumed by the fire!' and pours out the oblation as soon as the Vashat has been uttered.
6	1	30	Thereupon he says, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni Kavyavâhana!' that being for (Agni as) the Svishtakrit ('maker of good offering'). For to the gods indeed he is havyavâhana ('bearer of oblations'), and to the fathers he is kavyavâhana ('the bearer of what is meet for the wise'): hence he says, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni Kavyavâhana!'
6	1	31	He makes an under-layer of butter (in the offering-spoon); then cuts a piece from (the front part of) the cake, and therewith some of the parched grain and the porridge; puts down all this at the same time; and makes two sprinklings of butter thereon. The (places from which he has made the) cuttings he does not replenish with butter, nor does he walk across; but having stepped up (to the fire) on the same side (where he was seated), and called for the 'Sraushat,' he says, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to Agni Kavyavâhana!' and pours out the oblation, as soon as the Vashat has been uttered.
6	1	32	Now the reason why he does not walk across (to the ordinary place of offering), but pours out the oblation after stepping up (to the fire) on the sane side, is that the fathers have departed once for all; and the reason also, why he cuts but once from each of the sacrificial dishes, is that the fathers have departed once for all. And the reason why in making the cuttings, he keeps them together, is that the fathers are the seasons;--he thus keeps the seasons together, joins them to one another: that is why in making the cuttings, he keeps them together.
6	1	33	Here now some hand over that entire (remaining) porridge to the Hotri; and the Hotri, having invoked it , smells it and hands it to the[paragraph continues] Brahman. The Brahman smells it and hands it to the Âgnîdhra; and the Âgnîdhra also smells it. And so indeed they do this. But, as from any other oblation they cut off the Ida and the fore-portion, so let them cut from this also; and having invoked it (the Idâ) they smell it, but do not eat it. 'But,' said Âsuri, 'we think that some should be eaten, of whatever is offered up in the fire.'
6	1	34	Now he who is about to present (the obsequial cakes to the fathers),--either the Adhvaryu or the Sacrificer,--takes the vessel of water and walks thrice round (the altar) from right to left sprinkling all about (the altar). He then, with the text, 'N.N., wash thyself !' pours out water (in the north-west corner of the altar) for the Sacrificer's father  to wash himself; and (in the southwest corner), with 'N.N., wash thyself!' for the grandfather; and (in the south-east corner), with 'N.N., wash thyself!' for the great-grandfather.[paragraph continues] As one would pour out water for (a guest) who is to take food with him, so in this case.
6	1	35	Thereupon he takes one 'cutting' from the cake and puts it in his left hand; from the parched grain also he takes one cutting and puts it in his left hand; and from the porridge also he takes one cutting and puts it in his left hand.
6	1	36	And in the corner (of the altar) opposite this intermediate quarter (viz. the north-west), he then presents (an obsequial cake ) to the Sacrificer's father, with the formula, 'N.N., this for thee!' And in the corner opposite this intermediate quarter (the south-west), he presents one to the Sacrificer's grandfather, with 'N.N., this for thee!' And in the corner opposite this intermediate quarter (the southeast), he presents one to the Sacrificer's great-grandfather, with 'N.N., this for thee!' And in the corner opposite this intermediate quarter (the northeast), he cleanses (his hands), with the text , 'Here, O Fathers, regale yourselves! Like bulls come hither, each to his own share!' whereby he means to say, 'Eat ye each his share!' And the reason why he thus presents (food) to the Fathers is that in this way he does not exclude his own fathers from this sacrifice.
6	1	37	Thereupon they all, being sacrificially invested, walk out (of the shed) on the north side, (pass along the east side of, and) stand by the (north) side of, the Âhavanîya fire. For he who has established his fires, and performs the New and Full-moon sacrifices, approaches the gods; but they have just beenperforming the sacrifice to the Manes, and therefore they now propitiate the gods.
6	1	38	They stand by the Âhavanîya fire (worshipping) with two (verses) addressed to Indra [viz. Rig-veda I,
6	1	82	,
6	1	2-3	; Vâg. S. III,
6	1	51-52	], since the Âhavanîya is Indra. 'The friends have eaten, and regaled themselves, and have shaken off (the enemies) ; the self-shining bards have extolled (thee) with their newest hymn: yoke, then, thy pair of bay steeds, O Indra!--To thee, the splendid, we will sing praises, O bountiful one! Thus praised, do thou now issue forth, with well-filled car, agreeably to our desire! yoke, then, thy pair of bay steeds, O Indra!'
6	1	39	Thereupon they return to the Gârhapatya and stand by it worshipping with the verses , 'We invoke the Mind with man-lauding strain , and with the hymns of the fathers.--May the Mind come back to us for (us to obtain) wisdom, vigour, and life, and that we may long see the sun!--May the divine race restore to us the Mind, O Fathers, that we may abide with the living kind!' They have indeed been performing the sacrifice to the Manes; but now they return to the (land of the) living: hence he says, 'That we may abide with the living kind!'
6	1	40	Thereupon he who has presented (the obsequial cakes) again shifts his sacrificial cord to the right shoulder and betakes. himself (to the fire in the shed), and mutters , 'The[paragraph continues] Fathers have regaled themselves: like bulls they came each to his share:' whereby he means to say, 'they have eaten each his own share.'
6	1	41	He now takes the vessel of water and again, while sprinkling, walks thrice round (the altar) from left to right (sunwise). With 'N.N., wash thyself!' he pours out water (in the respective corner) for the Sacrificer's father to wash himself; with 'N.N., wash thyself!' for the grandfather; with 'N.N., wash thyself!' for the great-grandfather. As one would pour out water for (a guest) who has taken food with him, so in this case. And as to his again walking thrice round from left to right, while sprinkling,--they think, 'This holy work of ours shall be accomplished sunwise ,' and hence he walks thrice round from left to right, while sprinkling.
6	1	42	He then pulls down the tuck (of the nether garment)  and makes obeisance (to the Fathers). The tuck, doubtless, is sacred to the Fathers: hence he makes obeisance to them after pulling down the tuck; and obeisance means worship: hence he thereby recognises them as entitled to worship. Six times he makes obeisance to them, since there are six seasons, and the Fathers are the seasons: hence he thereby establishes his sacrifice in the seasons,--that is why he makes obeisance six times . 'Give housesunto us; O Fathers!' he (further) says, because the Fathers are the guardians of houses;--and this is the prayer for blessing at this sacred performance.
6	1	43	Being now about to proceed with the after-offerings, they all invest themselves sacrificially (by shifting the cord over to the left shoulder); and thus (invested) the Sacrificer and Brahman walk round to the west, and the Âgnîdhra to the east, side; and the Hotri sits down on the Hotri's seat.
6	1	44	He (the Adhvaryu) then says, 'Brahman, I shall step forward.' Thereupon he puts the stick (reserved at the time of kindling) on (the fire), and says, 'Agnîdh, trim the fire!' He then takes the two spoons and crosses over to the west side. After crossing over and calling for the 'Sraushat,' he says (to the Hotri), 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the gods!' He performs two after-offerings, omitting the one to the Barhis; for the Barhis means offspring: hence he performs two after-offerings, omitting the one to the Barhis, lest he should consign his offspring to the Fathers.
6	1	45	He then separates the two spoons , after laying them down (in their respective places on the altar); and having separated them, and anointed the enclosing-sticks, he takes one enclosing-stick, calls for the 'Sraushat,' and says, 'The divine Hotris are summoned for the proclamation of success, the human is called upon for the song of praise!' The Hotri intones the 'song of praise (sûktavâka).' The Adhvaryu, on the other hand, does not seize the prastara-bunch, but watches while the Hotri recites the song of praise.
6	1	46	Thereupon the Âgnîdhra says, 'Throw it after !' He (the Adhvaryu) throws nothing after, but silently touches himself.
6	1	47	He (the Âgnîdhra) then says, 'Discourse together!' [The Adhvaryu asks], 'Has he gone (to the gods), Agnîdh?'--'He has gone!'--'Bid (the gods) hear!'--'May one (or, they) hear!'--'Goodspeed to the divine Hotris! Success to the human!--Pronounce the All-hail and blessing!' Thus saying, he merely touches the enclosing-sticks, but does not (now) throw them (into the fire). The Barhis and enclosing-sticks he throws in afterwards .
6	1	48	And here some throw also the remaining sacrificial food into the fire; but let him not do so; for that (remaining havis) is the residue of an offering; and lest he should offer the residue of an offering, let them (the priests) rather throw it into the water or eat it.
6	2	1	Verily, by means of the Great Oblation the gods slew Vritra; by it they gained that supreme authority which they now wield. Now whichever of them were hit by (the Asuras’) arrows in that battle, those same darts they extracted, those they pulled out, by performing the Tryambaka-offerings.
6	2	2	And, accordingly, when he performs those offerings, he either does so hoping that thus no arrow[paragraph continues] (misfortune) will hit any of his, or because the gods did so. And thereby he delivers from Rudra's power both the descendants that are born unto him and those that are unborn; and his offspring is brought forth without disease and blemish. This is why he performs these offerings.
6	2	3	They are (offered) to Rudra: Rudra's, indeed, is the dart; and hence (these offerings) belong to Rudra. They consist of (cakes) on one potsherd: 'To one deity they shall belong!' so (he thinks, and) therefore they consist of (cakes) on one potsherd.
6	2	4	There is one for each individual,--as many as he has descendants,--exceeded by one. (There being) one for each individual, he thereby delivers from Rudra's power the descendants that are born unto him; and there being an additional one, he thereby delivers from Rudra's power the descendants that are not yet born to him: this is why there are (as many cakes as there are descendants) exceeded by one.
6	2	5	He takes out (the rice for) those (cakes), while seated behind the Gârhapatya, sacrificially invested and facing the north. From thence he rises and threshes (the rice), while standing with his face towards the north. He places the two mill-stones on (the black antelope skin, so as to incline) towards the north; and puts the potsherds on the north side of the Gârhapatya hearth. As to why they keep the northern quarter,--that indeed is the quarter of that god (Rudra), and hence they keep the northern quarter.
6	2	6	They (the cakes) may be anointed (with ghee),--for the havis is anointed ;--but let them rather beunanointed; for, indeed, Rudra would be hankering after the (sacrificer's) cattle, if he were to anoint (the cakes): let them therefore be unanointed.
6	2	7	Having removed all (the cakes from the potsherds) into one dish, and taken a fire-brand from the Dakshina-fire, he walks aside towards the north--for that is the region of that god--and offers. He offers on a road,--for on roads that god roves; he offers on a cross-road,--for the cross-road, indeed, is known to be his (Rudra's) favourite haunt . This is why he offers on a cross-road.
6	2	8	He offers with the central leaflet of a palâsa-leaf. The palâsa-leaf, truly, is the Brahman (priesthood) : with the Brahman, therefore, he offers. He takes a cutting from (the northern part of) all the cakes; from the additional one alone he takes no cutting.
6	2	9	He offers , with the text , This is thy share, O Rudra! graciously accept it together with thy sister Ambikâ! Svâhâ!' Ambikâ , indeed, is the name of his (Rudra's) sister; and this share belongs to him conjointly with her; and because that share belongs to him conjointly with a woman (strî), therefore (these oblations) are called Tryambakâh. Thereby, then, he delivers from Rudra's power the descendants that have been born unto him.
6	2	10	Now as to that additional (cake),--he buries it in a mole-hill , with the text , 'This is thy share, O Rudra! the mole is thy animal (victim).' He thus assigns to him the mole as the only animal , and he (Rudra) does not therefore injure any other animal. Then as to why he buries (the cake): concealed, indeed, are embryos, and concealed also is what is buried,--that is why he buries it. By this (offering) he delivers from the power of Rudra those descendants of his, that are not yet born.
6	2	11	Thereupon they return (to the fire) and mutter , 'We have satisfied the claims of Rudra, satisfied the divine Tryambaka, that he may make us richer, that he may make us more prosperous, that he may render us steady in our purpose.--Thou (O Rudra) art a remedy for the cow, a remedy for the horse, a remedy for man; a blessing for the ram and the ewe.' This is the prayer for blessing at this performance.
6	2	12	They then walk thrice round the altar not sun-wise, beating their left thighs (with the right hand), with the text , 'We worship Tryambaka, the fragrant increaser of prosperity. Even as a gourd (is severed) from its stem, so may I be severed from death, not from immortality!' This is the prayer for blessing at this performance: thereby they invoke a blessing (upon the Sacrificer), for verily blessed is he who shall be severed from death, not from immortality. That is why he says, 'May I be severed from death, not from immortality.'
6	2	13	Let the maidens then also walk round, thinking, 'May we enjoy prosperity!' That sister of Rudra, named Ambikâ, indeed is the dispenser of happiness: hence the maidens also should walk round, thinking, 'May we enjoy prosperity!'
6	2	14	The text (prescribed) for them is , 'We worship Tryambaka, the fragrant bestower of husbands. Even as a gourd (is severed) from its stem, so may I be severed from this. (world), not from thence (yonder world)!' By saying 'from this,' she means to say 'from my relatives;' and by saying 'not from thence,' she means to say 'not from husbands.' Husbands, doubtless, are the support of woman: hence she says 'not from thence.'
6	2	15	Then they (the Sacrificer and priests) again walk round thrice sunwise, beating their right thighs, with the same text. As to why they again walk round thrice sunwise,--they think, 'Sunwise this sacred work of ours shall be accomplished,' and therefore they again walk thrice round sunwise.
6	2	16	The Sacrificer now takes those (remains of the cakes) into his joined palms and throws them upwards higher than a cow can reach . Thereby they cut out his (Rudra's) darts from their bodies. If they fail to catch them , they touch (those that have fallen to the ground). Thereby they make them medicine, and hence, if they fail to catch them, they touch them.
6	2	17	Having then packed them into two net-work baskets and tied them to the two ends of either a bamboo staff or the beam of a balance, he stepsaside towards the north; and if he meets with a tree or a stake or a bamboo or an ant-hill, he fastens them thereon, with the text , 'These, O Rudra, are thy provisions; therewith depart beyond the Mûgavats!'--(supplied) with provisions people indeed set out on a journey: hence he thereby dismisses him supplied with provisions whithersoever he is bound. Now in this case his journey is beyond the Mûgavats: hence he says, 'Depart beyond the Mûgavats!'--'with thy bow unstrung and muffled up--,' whereby he means to say, 'Depart propitious, not injuring us ;' 'Clad in a skin,'--whereby he lulls him to sleep ; for while sleeping he injures no one: hence he says, 'Clad in a skin.'
6	2	18	They then turn to the right about, and return (to the uttaravedi) without looking back. Having returned thither, they touch water; for they have been performing a ceremony relating to Rudra , and water is (a means of) purification: with water, that (means of) purification, they accordingly purify themselves.
6	2	19	Thereupon he shaves his hair and beard, and takes up the fire (of the uttaravedi),--for only after changing his place (to the ordinary sacrificial ground) he performs the (Full-moon) sacrifice on that fire, since it is not proper that he should perform the[paragraph continues] Agnihotra on the uttaravedi: for this reason he changes his place. Having gone to the house, and 'churned out' the fires , he performs the Full-moon offering. The Seasonal offerings, doubtless, are detached sacrifices; whereas the Full-moon offering is a regular, established sacrifice: hence he finally establishes himself by means of that regular sacrifice, and therefore changes his place (to the ordinary sacrificial ground).
6	3	1	Verily, imperishable is the righteousness of him that offers the Seasonal sacrifices; for such a one gains the year, and hence there is no cessation for him. He gains it (the year) in three divisions, he conquers it in three divisions. The year means the whole, and the whole is imperishable (without end): hence his righteousness is indeed imperishable. Moreover, he thereby becomes a Season, and as such goes to the gods; but there is no perishableness in the gods, and hence there is imperishable righteousness for him. This, then, is why he offers the Seasonal sacrifices.
6	3	2	Then as to why he should perform the Sunâsîrya offering. The prosperity (srî) that accrued to the gods on performing the Sâkamedha offerings, and gaining the victory (over Vritra), is suna; and the essence (rasa) that belonged to the year gained by them is sîra . Now that same prosperity whichaccrued to the gods on performing the Sâkamedha offerings, and that same essence which belonged to the year gained by them,--both these he takes possession of and makes his own: that is why he performs the Sunâsîrya.
6	3	3	The mode of its performance (is as follows): They prepare no uttaravedi; they do not use clotted butter; nor do they churn the fire . There are five fore-offerings, three after-offerings, and one Samishtayagus.
6	3	4	Then, in the first place, there are those five (regular) oblations . By means of these oblations, indeed, Pragâpati produced creatures; with them he delivered the creatures both ways from Varuna's noose; with them the gods slew Vritra and gained that victory which was gained by them. And so does he, by means of them, obtain and make his own, both that prosperity which accrued to the gods from performing the Sâkamedha offerings, and that essence of the year which was gained by them. This is why those five oblations are (offered).
6	3	5	Then follows a Sunâsîrya  cake on twelvepotsherds. The import of this Sunâsîrya oblation is what we have stated before.
6	3	6	After that there is an (oblation of) milk  to Vâyu. Now it is to milk that living beings readily take, when they are born: 'May the creatures readily take to me--now that I have gained the victory (by means of the Sâkamedha offerings)--for my prosperity, glory, and support!' so he thinks, and hence that (oblation of) milk.
6	3	7	Then as to why it is (offered) to Vâyu. Now Vâyu, indeed, is yonder blowing (wind); it is he that makes swell whatever rain falls here. But it is by the rain that plants grow; and on the plants being eaten and the water drunk, milk is produced out of that water. Hence it is he (Vâyu) that produces it; and for this reason it is (offered) to Vâyu.
6	3	8	Then follows a cake on one potsherd for Sûrya. Now Sûrya, indeed, is yonder scorching (sun); it is he that governs all this (world), now by means of a good, now by a bad (king) ; he assigns its place to everything here, now under a good, now under a bad (king): 'Now that I have obtained the victory, may he, in his pleasure, govern me through a good (king), may he assign to me a place under a good (king)!' thus he thinks; and for this reason there is a cake on one potsherd for Sûrya.
6	3	9	The priests' fee for this (oblation to Sûrya)is a white horse ; whereby it is made of the characteristic form of yonder scorching (sun). If he be unable to procure a white horse, it may be a white bull; whereby it is likewise made of the characteristic form of yonder scorching (sun).
6	3	10	He may offer the Sunâsîrya at the same time when he performs the Sâkamedha offerings. By offering (Seasonal sacrifices) three times in the year, he indeed obtains the (whole) year: he may therefore offer (the Sunâsîrya) at any time .
6	3	11	Here now some wish to take possession of the nights; and should he wish to take possession of the nights, let him offer the Sunâsîrya (on the day) when, previously to the full-moon of Phâlguna, (the new moon) becomes visible in yonder sky.
6	3	12	Let him then get consecrated (for the Soma-sacrifice), lest the Phâlguna full-moon again pass by without his offering (Soma). For were the Phâlguna full-moon again to pass by without his havingoffered (Soma), he would certainly have to begin anew (to perform the Seasonal offerings): hence the Phâlguna full-moon should not again pass by without his offering Soma. Such (is the rule) for him who discontinues (the Seasonal offerings).
6	3	13	And in the case of one who recommences (the Seasonal offerings),--let him perform the Sunâsîrya on the day preceding the Phâlguna full-moon, and on the following day the Vaisvadeva, and after that the Full-moon offering. This, then, (is the rule) for him who recommences (the Seasonal offerings).
6	3	14	Then as to (the Sacrificer) shaving his head all round . Now yonder sun, indeed, faces every quarter; it drinks up whatever (moisture) it dries up here: hence this (Sacrificer) thereby faces every quarter and becomes a consumer of food.
6	3	15	This fire also faces every quarter, since it burns all they put into it from whatsoever quarter: hence this (Sacrificer) thereby faces every quarter and becomes a consumer of food.
6	3	16	This man, on the other hand, faces but one quarter; but by shaving his head all round he comes to face every quarter; and whosoever, knowing this, has his head shaved all round, becomes just such a consumer of food as those two: let him therefore have his head shaved all round.
6	3	17	And on this point Âsuri said, 'What in the world has it to do with his face, even if he were to shave off all the hair of his head! It is by offeringthrice in the year that he comes to face all the quarters and becomes a consumer of food: let him therefore not trouble himself about shaving his head.'
6	4	1	Now when it is said, that the gods, by means of the Sâkamedha -offerings, slew Vritra and gained that supreme authority which they now wield,--it is rather by means of all the Seasonal sacrifices that the gods slew Vritra; it is by all of them that they gained that supreme authority which they now wield.
6	4	2	They spake, 'With what king, with what leader  shall we fight?' Agni spake, 'With me for your king, with me for your leader!' With Agni for their king, with Agni for their leader, they gained four months; and with the Brahman (sacerdotium) and the threefold science they encompassed them.
6	4	3	They spake, 'With what king, with what leader shall we fight?' Varuna spake, 'With me for your king, with me for your leader!' With Varuna for their king, with Varuna for their leader, they gained other four months; and with the Brahman and the threefold science they encompassed them.
6	4	4	They spake, 'With what king, with what leader shall we fight?' Indra spake, 'With me for your king, with me for your leader!' With Indra for their king, with Indra for their leader, they gained other four months; and with the Brahman and the threefold science they encompassed them.
6	4	5	And, accordingly, when he performs the Vaisvadeva, he thereby gains four months, with Agni for his king, with Agni for his leader. Then (in shaving) are used a porcupine's quill spotted in three places, and a copper razor; that three-spotted porcupine's quill resembles the threefold science, and the copper razor resembles the Brahman; for the Brahman is fire, and fire is of reddish (lohita) colour: hence a copper (loha) razor is used. Therewith he has (his head) shaved all round ; and thus he (the Adhvaryu) encompasses him with the Brahman and the threefold science.
6	4	6	And when he performs the Varunapraghâsa offerings, he thereby gains other four months, with Varuna for his king, with Varuna for his leader. Then a three-spotted quill of a porcupine and a copper razor are used, wherewith he has himself shaved all round; and thus he (the priest) encompasses him with the Brahman and the threefold science.
6	4	7	And when he performs the Sâkamedha offerings, he thereby gains other four months, with Indra for his king, with Indra for his leader. Then a three-spotted quill of a porcupine and a copper razor are used, wherewith he has himself shaved; and thus he (the priest) encompasses him with the Brahman and the threefold science.
6	4	8	And when he performs the Vaisvadeva, then he becomes Agni, and attains to union with Agni and to co-existence in his world. And when he performs the Varunapraghâsa offerings, then he becomes Varuna, and attains to union with Varunaand to co-existence in his world. And when he performs the Sâkamedha offerings, then he becomes Indra, and attains to union with Indra and to coexistence in his world .
6	4	9	And in whatever season he goes to yonder world, that season passes him on to the next season, and that season again passes him on to the next season,--he who performs the Seasonal sacrifices reaches the highest place, the supreme goal. Wherefore it is said, 'They find not him that offereth the Seasonal offerings, for verily he goeth unto the highest place, to the supreme goal .'
