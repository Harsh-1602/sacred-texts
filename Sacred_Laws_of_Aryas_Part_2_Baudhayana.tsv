1	1	1	1	The sacred law is taught in each Veda.
1	1	1	2	We will explain (it) in accordance with that.
1	1	1	3	(The sacred law), taught in the Tradition (Smriti, stands) second.
1	1	1	4	The practice of the Sishtas (stands) third.
1	1	1	5	Sishtas, forsooth, (are those) who are free from envy, free from pride, contented with a store of grain sufficient for ten days, free from covetousness, and free from hypocrisy, arrogance, greed, perplexity, and anger.
1	1	1	6	'(Those are called) Sishtas who, in accordance with the sacred law, have studied the Veda together with its appendages, know how to draw inferences from that, (and) are able to adduce proofs perceptible by the senses from the revealed texts.'
1	1	1	7	On failure of them, an assembly consisting at least of ten members (shall decide disputed points of law).
1	1	1	8	Now they quote also (the following verses): 'Four men, who each know one of the four Vedas, a Mîmâmsaka, one who knows the Aṅgas, one who recites (the works on) the sacred law, and three Brâhmanas belonging to (three different) orders, (constitute) an assembly consisting, at least, of ten members.'
1	1	1	9	'There may be five, or there may be three, or there may be one blameless man, who decides (questions regarding) the sacred law. But a thousand fools (can)not (do it).'
1	1	1	10	'As an elephant made of wood, as an antelope made of leather, such is an unlearned Brâhmana: those three having nothing but the name (of their kind).'
1	1	1	11	'That sin which dunces, perplexed by ignorance and unacquainted with the sacred law, declare (to be duty), falls, increased a hundredfold, on those who propound it.'
1	1	1	12	'Narrow and difficult to find is the path of the sacred law, towards which many gates lead. Hence, if there is a doubt, it must not be propounded by one man (only), however learned he may be.'
1	1	1	13	'What Brâhmanas, riding in the chariot of the law (and) wielding the sword of the Veda, propound even in jest, that is declared to be the highest law.'
1	1	1	14	'As wind and sun will make water, collected on a stone, disappear, even so the sin that (cleaves) to an offender completely vanishes like water.'
1	1	1	15	'He who knows the sacred law shall fix the penances with discernment, taking into consideration the constitution, the strength, the knowledge, and the age (of the offender), as well as the time and the deed.'
1	1	1	16	Many thousands (of Brâhmanas) cannot form a (legal) assembly (for declaring the sacred law), if they have not fulfilled their sacred duties, are unacquainted with the Veda, and subsist only by the name of their caste.'
1	1	2	1	There is a dispute regarding five (practices) both in the south and in the north.
1	1	2	2	We will explain those (peculiar) to the south.
1	1	2	3	They are, to eat in the company of an uninitiated person, to eat in the company of one's wife, to eat stale food, to marry the daughter of a maternal uncle or of a paternal aunt.
1	1	2	4	Now (the customs peculiar) to the north are, to deal in wool, to drink rum, to sell animals that have teeth in the upper and in the lower jaws, to follow the trade of arms, to go to sea.
1	1	2	5	He who follows (these practices) in any other country than where they prevail, commits sin.
1	1	2	6	For each (of these customs) the (rule of the) country should be (considered) the authority.
1	1	2	7	Gautama declares that that is false.
1	1	2	8	And one should not take heed of either (set of practices) because they are opposed to the tradition of the Sishtas.
1	1	2	9	The country of the Âryas (Âryâvarta) lies to the east of the region where (the river Sarasvatî) disappears, to the west of the Black-forest (Kâlakavana), to the north of the Pâripâtra (mountains), to the south of the Himâlaya. The rule of conduct which (prevails) there, is authoritative.
1	1	2	10	Some (declare) the country between the (rivers) Yamunâ and Ganges (to be the Âryâvarta).
1	1	2	11	Now the Bhâllavins quote also the (following) verse:
1	1	2	12	'In the west the boundary-river, in the east the region where the sun rises,--as far as the black antelopes wander (between these two limits), so far spiritual pre-eminence (is found).'
1	1	2	13	The inhabitants of Avantî, of Aṅga, of Magadha, of Surâshtra, of the Dekhan, of Upâvrit, of Sindh, and the Sauvîrâs are of mixed origin.
1	1	2	14	He who has visited the (countries of the) Ârattas, Kâraskaras, Pundras, Sauvîras, Vaṅgas, Kaliṅgas, (or) Prânûnas shall offer a Punastoma or a Sarvaprishthâ (ishti).
1	1	2	15	Now they quote also (the following verses): 'He commits sin through his feet, who travels to the (country of the) Kaliṅgas. The sages declare the Vaisvânarî ishti to be a purification for him.'
1	1	2	16	'Even if many offences have been committed, they recommend for the removal of the sin the Pavitreshti. For that (sacrifice) is a most excellent means of purification.'
1	1	2	17	Now they quote also (the following verse): 'He who performs (by turns) in each season the Vaisvânarî (ishti), the Vrâtapatî (ishti), and the Pavitreshti is freed from (all) sins.'
1	2	3	1	The (term of the) studentship for (learning the) Veda, as kept by the ancients, (is) forty-eight years,
1	2	3	2	(Or) twenty-four (years), or twelve for each Veda,
1	2	3	3	Or at the least one year for each Kânda,
1	2	3	4	Or until (the Veda has been) learned; for life is uncertain.
1	2	3	5	A passage of the revealed texts declares, 'Let him kindle the sacred fires while his hair is (still) black.'
1	2	3	6	They do not put any (religious) restrictions on the acts of a (child) before the investiture with the girdle (is performed). For he is on a level with a Sûdra before (his second) birth through the Veda.
1	2	3	7	The number of years (must be calculated) from the conception. Let him initiate a Brâhmana in the eighth (year) after that,
1	2	3	8	A Kshatriya three (years) later (than a Brâhmana),
1	2	3	9	A Vaisya one year later than a (Kshatriya).
1	2	3	10	Spring, summer, and autumn are the seasons (for the initiation) according to the order of the castes.
1	2	3	11	(Let him perform the initiation reciting), according to the order (of the castes), a Gâyatrî, a Trishtubh, (or) a Gagatî (verse).
1	2	3	12	Up to the sixteenth, the twenty-second, and the twenty-fourth (years) respectively (the time for the initiation) has not passed.
1	2	3	13	The girdles (shall consist of a rope) made of Muñga grass, a bow-string, (or a rope) made of hemp.
1	2	3	14	The skins (shall be) those of a black antelope, of a spotted deer, (or) of a he-goat.
1	2	3	15	The staff shall reach the crown of the head, the forehead, (or) the tip of the nose, (and be made) of a tree fit for a sacrifice. The details have been stated above.
1	2	3	16	Let him beg, (employing a formula) consisting of seven syllables, with the word bhavat in the beginning, with the word bhikshâ in the middle, and with the (verb expressing) the request at the end; and let him not pronounce loudly (the syllables) kshâ and hi.
1	2	3	17	A Brâhmana (student) shall ask for alms, placing (the word) 'Lady' first, a Kshatriya placing it in the middle, (and) a Vaisya placing it at the end (of the formula), from (men of) all castes.
1	2	3	18	The (persons fit to be asked) are Brâhmanas and so forth, who follow (their lawful) occupations.
1	2	3	19	Let him daily fetch fuel out of the forest and offer (it in the sacred fire).
1	2	3	20	(A student shall be) truthful, modest, and devoid of pride.
1	2	3	21	He shall rise before (his teacher in the morning) and go to rest after (him in the evening).
1	2	3	22	He shall never disobey the words of his teacher except (when he is ordered to commit) a crime causing loss of caste.
1	2	3	23	Let him converse with women so much (only) as his purpose requires.
1	2	3	24	Let him avoid dancing, singing, playing musical instruments, the use of perfumes, garlands, shoes, (or) a parasol, applying collyrium (to his eyes), and anointing (his body).
1	2	3	25	Let him take hold (of his teacher's) right (foot) with the right (hand), and of the left (foot) with the left hand.
1	2	3	26	If he desires long life and (bliss in) heaven, (he may act) at his pleasure (in the same manner) towards other holy (men), after having received permission from his teacher.
1	2	3	27	(Let him say), 'I N. N., ho! (salute thee),' touching his ears, in order to compose the internal organ.
1	2	3	28	(Let him embrace his teacher's leg) below the knee down to the feet.
1	2	3	29	(A student shall not embrace his teacher) when he (himself) is seated, or lying down, or impure, nor when (his teacher) is seated, lying down, or impure.
1	2	3	30	If he can (find water to sip), he shall not remain impure even during a muhûrta.
1	2	3	31	If he carries a load of fuel or holds a pot, flowers, or food in his hands, he shall not salute; nor (shall he do it) on similar occasions.
1	2	3	32	Let him not salute (the teacher) standing too close,
1	2	3	33	Nor, if he has reached the age of puberty, the young wives of brothers and the young wives of the teacher.
1	2	3	34	To sit together with (these persons) in a boat, on a rock, on a plank, on an elephant, on the roof of a house, on a mat, or in wheeled vehicles is permissible.
1	2	3	35	(The pupil) must assist his teacher in making his toilet, shampoo him, attend him while bathing, eat his leavings, and so forth.
1	2	3	36	(But he) should avoid the remnants of food left by his (teacher's) son, though he may know the Veda together with the Aṅgas,
1	2	3	37	And to assist at the toilet of, to shampoo, to attend in the bath, and to eat the remnants of food left by a young wife of his (teacher).
1	2	3	38	Let him run after (his teacher) when he runs, walk after him when he walks, attend him standing when he stands.
1	2	3	39	Let him not sport in the water while bathing.
1	2	3	40	Let him swim (motionless) like a stick.
1	2	3	41	To study under a non-Brâhmanical teacher (is permitted) in times of distress.
1	2	3	42	(The pupil shall) obey and walk after him as long as the instruction (lasts).
1	2	3	43	(According to some this is improper, because) just that (mutual relation) sanctifies both of them.
1	2	3	44	And (the behaviour) towards brothers, sons, and (other) pupils (of the teacher shall be regulated) in the same manner.
1	2	3	45	But officiating priests, a father-in-law, paternal and maternal uncles who are younger than (oneself must be honoured by) rising and (by being) addressed.
1	2	3	46	Kâtya (declares that) the salutation shall be returned.
1	2	3	47	For (the propriety of that rule) is apparent (from the story) about Sisu Âṅgirasa.
1	2	4	1	If merit and wealth are not (obtained by teaching), nor (at least) the due obedience, one should die with one's learning; one should not sow it on barren soil.
1	2	4	2	As fire consumes dry grass, even so the Veda, asked for, (but) not honoured, (destroys the enquirer). Therefore let him not proclaim the Veda to those who do not show him honour according to their ability.
1	2	4	3	They proclaim to him a command to the following effect;
1	2	4	4	'Brahman, forsooth, made the created beings over to Death. The student alone it did not make over to him.' He (Death) spake, 'Let me have a share in him.' (Brahman answered), 'That night in which he may neglect to offer a piece of sacred fuel (shall belong to thee),'
1	2	4	5	'Therefore a student who passes a night without offering a piece of sacred fuel, cuts it off from the length of his life, Therefore let the student offer a piece of sacred fuel, lest he spend a night, shortening his life.'
1	2	4	6	'A long sacrificial session begins he who commences his studentship. That (night) in which, after being initiated, he (first) offers a piece of sacred fuel corresponds to the Prâyanîya (Atirâtra of a sacrificial session); that night in which (he offers it last), intending to take the final bath, corresponds to the Udayanîya (Atirâtra), Those nights which (lie) between (these two terms correspond) just to the nights of his sacrificial session.'
1	2	4	7	'A Brâhmana who becomes a student of the Veda, enters existent beings in a fourfold manner, (viz.) with one quarter (he enters) Fire, with one quarter Death, with one quarter the Teacher, the fourth quarter remains in the Soul. When he offers to Fire a piece of sacred fuel, he thereby buys back even that quarter which (resides) in Fire, hallowing it, he places it in himself; that enters into him. Now when making himself poor and, becoming shameless, he asks for alms (and) lives as a student of the Veda, he thereby buys back the quarter which (resides) in Death; hallowing it, he places it in himself; that enters into him. Now when he obeys the orders of his Teacher, he thereby buys back that quarter which (resides) in the Teacher; hallowing it, he places it in himself; that enters into him. [Now when he recites the Veda, he thereby buys back the quarter which resides in the Soul. Hallowing it, he places it in himself; that enters into him.] Let him not go to beg, after he has bathed (on finishing his studentship). . . . If he does not find another woman whom he can ask for alms,, let him beg even from his own teacher's wife or from his own mother. The seventh (night) shall not pass without his asking for alms. [(He commits) sin if he does not go out to ask for alms and does not place fuel on the fire. If he neglects that during seven (days and) nights, he must perform the penance prescribed for one who has broken the vow of studentship.] All the Vedas come to him who knows that and acts thus.'
1	2	4	8	'As a blazing fire shines, even so shines he who, knowing this, thus fulfils the duties of studentship, after he has bathed (on leaving his teacher).' Thus speaks the Brâhmana.
1	3	5	1	Now (follow the duties) of a Snâtaka.
1	3	5	2	He shall wear a lower garment and upper garment.
1	3	5	3	Let him carry a staff made of bamboo,
1	3	5	4	And a pot filled with water.
1	3	5	5	Let him wear two sacrificial threads.
1	3	5	6	(He shall possess) a turban, an upper garment (consisting of) a skin, shoes, and a parasol. (He shall keep) a sacred fire and (offer) the new and full moon (Sthâlîpâkas).
1	3	5	7	He shall cause the hair of his head, of his beard, and of his body, and his nails to be cut on the Parva days.
1	3	5	8	His livelihood (he shall obtain in the following manner):
1	3	5	9	Let him beg uncooked (food) from Brâhmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, or carpenters,
1	3	5	10	Or (cooked) food (even from many).
1	3	5	11	Let him remain silent (when he goes to beg).
1	3	5	12	Let him perform with that all Pâkayagñas, offered to the gods and manes, and the rites, securing welfare.
1	3	5	13	Baudhâyana declares that by (following) this rule the most excellent sages reach the highest abode of Pragâpati Parameshthin.
1	4	6	1	Now (those who know the law) prescribe the carrying of a waterpot.
1	4	6	2	It is declared (in the Vedas) that fire (resides) in the right ear of a goat, in the right hand of a Brâhmana, likewise in water (and) in a bundle of Kusa grass. Therefore after personal purification let him wipe (his water-vessel) on all sides with his (right) hand, (reciting the mantra), 'Blaze up, O fire;' for that (is called) encircling it with fire and is preferable to heating (the pot on the fire).
1	4	6	3	With reference to this matter they prescribe also (the following rules): 'If he thinks in his heart that (the pot) has been slightly defiled, let him light Kusa or (other) grass and heat (the pot) on all sides, keeping his right hand turned towards it.'
1	4	6	4	'If (pots) have been touched by crows, dogs, or other (unclean animals, they shall be heated, until they are of) the colour of fire, after the (paryagnikarana has been performed).'
1	4	6	5	(Pots) which have been defiled by urine, ordure, blood, semen, and the like must be thrown away.
1	4	6	6	If his waterpot has been broken, let him offer one hundred (oblations) reciting the Vyâhritis, or mutter (the Vyâhritis as often).
1	4	6	7	(Reciting the text), 'Earth went to earth, the mother joined the mother; may we have sons and cattle; may he who hates us be destroyed,' he shall collect the fragments, throw them into water, repeat the Gâyatrî at least ten times and take again another (pot).
1	4	6	8	Taking refuge with Varuna, (he shall recite the mantra), 'That (belongs) to thee, Varuna; again to me, Om,' (and) meditate on the indestructible.
1	4	6	9	'If he has received (the new vessel) from a Sûdra, let him recite (the Gâyatrî) one hundred (times). (If he has received it) from a Vaisya, fifty (repetitions of the Gâyatrî) are prescribed, but (on receiving it) from a Kshatriya twenty-five, (and on taking it) from a Brâhmana ten.'
1	4	6	10	Those who recite the Veda are doubtful whether he shall fetch water after the sun has, set or shall not fetch it.
1	4	6	11	The most excellent (opinion is) that he may fetch it.
1	4	6	12	Let him restrain his breath, while he fetches water.
1	4	6	13	Fire, forsooth, takes up water.
1	4	6	14	It is declared (in the Veda), 'When he has washed his hands and feet with water from his water-vessel, he is impure for others, as long as the moisture (remains). He purifies himself only. Let him not perform other religious rites (with water from his pot).'
1	4	6	15	Baudhâyana (says), 'Or if on the occasion of each personal purification (he washes himself with other water) up to the wrist, (he will become) pure.'
1	4	6	16	Now they quote also (the following verses):
1	4	7	1	'Formerly (the use of) a waterpot has been prescribed by Brahman and the chief sages for the purification of twice-born men. Therefore he shall always carry one.' 'He who desires his own welfare, shall use it without hesitation, for purifying (his person), for drinking, and for performing his twilight devotions.'
1	4	7	2	Let him do it with a believing heart; a wise man must not corrupt his mind. The self-existent [paragraph continues] (Brahman) came into existence with a water-vessel. Therefore let him perform (his rites) with a water-vessel.
1	4	7	3	Let him hold it in his right hand when he voids urine and excrements, in the left when he sips water. That is (a) settled (rule) for all good men.
1	4	7	4	For as the sacrificial cusp (kamasa) is declared to be pure on account of its contact with the Soma-juice, even so the water-vessel is constantly pure through its contact with water.
1	4	7	5	Therefore let him avoid (to use) it for the worship of the manes, the gods, and the fire.
1	4	7	6	Therefore let him not go on a journey without a waterpot, nor to the boundary of the village, nor from one house to the other.
1	4	7	7	Some (declare that he must not go without it) a step further than the length of an arrow.
1	4	7	8	Baudhâyana (says that he shall not go without it) if he wishes to fulfil his duties constantly.
1	4	7	9	(The divine) Word declares that (this is con-firmed) by a Rik-shaped (passage).
1	5	8	1	Now (follows the description of) the means of purification.
1	5	8	2	The body is purified by water, the understanding by knowledge, the soul by abstention from injuring living beings, the internal organ by truth.
1	5	8	3	Purifying the internal organ (is called) internal purification.
1	5	8	4	We will explain (the rules of) external purification.
1	5	8	5	The sacrificial thread (shall be made) of Kusa grass, or cotton, (and consist) of thrice three strings.
1	5	8	6	(It shall hang down) to the navel.
1	5	8	7	(In putting it on) he shall raise the right arm, lower the left, and lower the head.
1	5	8	8	The contrary (is done at sacrifices) to the manes.
1	5	8	9	(If the thread is) suspended round the neck, (it is called) nivîta.
1	5	8	10	(If it is) suspended below (the navel, it is called) adhopavîta.
1	5	8	11	Let him perform (the rite of personal) purification, facing the east or the north, (and) seated in a pure place; (let him) place his right arm between his knees and wash both hands up to the wrist and both feet (up to the ankles).
1	5	8	12	Let him not use for sipping the remainder of the water with which he has washed his feet.
1	5	8	13	But if he uses (that) for sipping, let him do it, after pouring (a portion of it) on the ground.
1	5	8	14	He shall sip out of the Tîrtha sacred to Brahman.
1	5	8	15	The part (of the hand) at the root of the thumb (is called) the Tîrtha sacred to Brahman.
1	5	8	16	The part above the thumb (is called the Tîrtha) sacred to the manes, the part at the tips of the fingers that sacred to the gods, the part at the root of the fingers that sacred to the Rishis.
1	5	8	17	(Let him not use for sipping water that has trickled) from the fingers, nor (water) that is covered with bubbles or foam, nor (water that is) hot, or alkaline, or salt, or muddy, or discoloured, or has a bad smell or taste.
1	5	8	18	(Let him not sip water) laughing, nor talking, nor standing, nor looking about, nor bending his head or his body forward, nor while the lock on his crown is untied, nor while his throat is wrapped up, nor while his head is covered, nor when he is in a hurry, nor without wearing the sacrificial thread, nor stretching his feet out, nor while his loins are girt (with a cloth), nor without holding his right arm between his knees, nor making a sound.
1	5	8	19	Let him thrice drink water that reaches his heart.
1	5	8	20	Let him wipe (his lips) thrice.
1	5	8	21	Some (declare that he shall do it) twice.
1	5	8	22	A woman and a Sûdra (shall perform) both (acts) once (only).
1	5	8	23	Now they quote also (the following verse): A Brâhmana is purified by water that reaches his heart, a Kshatriya by (water) reaching his throat, a Vaisya by (water barely) taken into the mouth, a woman and a Sûdra by touching (it) with the extremity (of the lips).
1	5	8	24	'If (drops) adhere to his teeth, (they must be considered pure) like the teeth, because they are fixed (in the mouth) like the teeth. Let him not sip water on their account in case they fall. If they flow out, he will be pure.'
1	5	8	25	Now they quote also (the following verse): If anything adheres to the teeth, (it is pure) like the teeth; and if he swallows (it or) whatever else may be in the mouth (or) may remain after sipping water, (he will become) pure.'
1	5	8	26	(After sipping) he shall touch the cavities (of the head) with water, the feet, the navel, the head, (and) lastly the left hand.
1	5	8	27	If he becomes impure while holding (a vessel) made of metal, he shall put it down, sip water and sprinkle it, when he is going to take it up.
1	5	8	28	Now if he becomes impure (while he is occupied) with food, he shall put it down, sip water and sprinkle it, when he is going to take it up.
1	5	8	29	Now if he becomes impure (while occupied)with water, he shall put it down, sip water and sprinkle it, when he is going to take it up
1	5	8	30	That is contrary (to the rule) in (the case of an earthen) vessel.
1	5	8	31	In (the case of a vessel) made of wood there is an option.
1	5	8	32	Defiled (objects) made of metal must be scoured with cowdung, earth, and ashes, or with one of these (three).
1	5	8	33	Copper, silver, and gold (must be cleaned) with acids.
1	5	8	34	Earthen vessels must be heated.
1	5	8	35	(Objects) made of wood must be planed.
1	5	8	36	(Objects) made of bamboo (must be cleaned) with cowdung,
1	5	8	37	(Objects) made of fruits with a rope of cow-hair,
1	5	8	38	Skins of black deer with (ground) Bel nut and rice,
1	5	8	39	Blankets (of the hair of the mountain goat) with Areka nuts,
1	5	8	40	(Cloth) made of (sheep's) wool by the (rays of the) sun,
1	5	8	41	Linen (cloth) with a paste of yellow mustard,
1	5	8	42	Cotton cloth with earth,
1	5	8	43	Skins (other than deer-skins shall be treated) like cotton cloth,
1	5	8	44	Stones and gems like (objects) made of metal,
1	5	8	45	Bones like wood,
1	5	8	46	Conch-shells, horn, pearl-shells, and ivory like linen cloth.
1	5	8	47	Or (they may be cleaned) with milk.
1	5	8	48	(Objects) which have been defiled by urine, ordure, blood, semen, or a dead body, (but) are agreeable to the eye and the nose, shall be rubbed seven times with one of the substances mentioned above.
1	5	8	49	(Objects) not made of metal which are in the same condition must be thrown away.
1	5	8	50	The cups and vessels (used) at a sacrifice (must be cleaned) according to the injunction (of the Veda).
1	5	8	51	The Veda (declares), 'They do not become impure through Soma.'
1	5	8	52	'Time, fire, purity of mind, water and the like (fluids), smearing with cowdung and ignorance (of defilement) are declared to be the sixfold (means of) purification for created beings.'
1	5	8	53	Now they quote also (the following verse):[paragraph continues] 'A clever man, who knows (the rules of) purification and is desirous of righteousness, shall perform (the rites of) purification, after having fully considered the time, and the place (of the defilement), likewise himself, (as well as) the object (to be cleaned) and the substance (to be employed), the purpose of the object, the cause (of the defilement), and the condition (of the thing or person defiled).'
1	5	9	1	The Veda declares that the hand of an artisan is always pure, so is every vendible commodity exposed for sale and food obtained by begging, which a student holds in. his hand.
1	5	9	2	A calf is pure on the flowing (of the milk), a bird on the fall of the fruit, women at the time of dalliance, and a dog when he catches a deer.
1	5	9	3	All mines and places of manufacture are pure excepting distilleries of spirituous liquor; continuously flowing streams of water and dust raised by the wind cannot be contaminated.
1	5	9	4	The flowers and fruit of flowering and fruit-bearing trees which grow in unclean places are likewise not impure.
1	5	9	5	On touching a tree standing on a sacred spot, a funeral pile, a sacrificial post, a Kandâla or a person who sells the Veda, a Brâhmana shall bathe dressed in his clothes.
1	5	9	6	One's own couch, seat, clothes, wife, child, and waterpot are pure for oneself; but for strangers they are impure.
1	5	9	7	A seat, a couch, a vehicle, ships (and boats), the road and grass are purified by the wind, if they have been touched by Kandâlas or outcasts.
1	5	9	8	Grain on the threshing-floor, water in wells and reservoirs, and milk in the cowpen are fit for use even (if they come) from a person whose food must not be eaten.
1	5	9	9	The gods created for Brâhmanas three means of purification, (viz.) ignorance of defilement, sprinkling with water, and commending by word of mouth.
1	5	9	10	Water collected on the ground with which cows slake their thirst is a means of purification, provided it is not strongly mixed with unclean (substances), nor has a (bad) smell, nor is discoloured, nor has a (bad) taste.
1	5	9	11	But land becomes pure, according to the degree of the defilement, by sweeping the (defiled) spot, by sprinkling it with water, by smearing it with cowdung, by scattering (pure earth) on it, or by scraping it.
1	5	9	12	Now they quote also (the following verse):
1	5	10	1	'A drop of water which is allowed to fall (on the ground) purifies a bull's hide of land, whether (the land) has been (previously) swept or not, provided no impure substance is visible on it.'
1	5	10	2	Food which is cooked out of sight must be illuminated (with fire) and be sprinkled with water,
1	5	10	3	Likewise eatables bought in the market.
1	5	10	4	For the Veda (declares), 'For the gods who are (easily) disgusted and desirous of purity do notenjoy the offerings made by a man destitute of faith.'
1	5	10	5	After reflecting (for a, long time on the respective value of) the (food) of a pure man destitute of faith and of an impure person who has faith, the gods declared both to be equal. But the Lord of created beings said to them, 'That is not equal, it is unequal. The food of a man destitute of faith is worthless, that which is purified by faith is preferable.'
1	5	10	6	Now they quote also (the following verses): 'Want of faith is the greatest sin; for faith is the highest austerity. Therefore the gods do not eat offerings given without faith.'
1	5	10	7	'A foolish man does not reach heaven, though he may offer (sacrifices) or give (gifts).'
1	5	10	8	'He is called a foolish man whose conduct is blemished by doubts, and who, clinging to his own fancies, transgresses (the rules of) the Sâstras, because he opposes the fulfilment of the sacred law.'
1	5	10	9	But pot-herbs, flowers, fruit, roots, and annual plants (must be) sprinkled (with water).
1	5	10	10	Having placed dry grass, wood of trees unfit for sacrifices or a clod of earth (on the ground), let him void faeces or urine, turning his face during the day towards the north and at night towards the south and wrapping up his head.
1	5	10	11	(After voiding) urine he shall clean (the organ once) with earth and water,
1	5	10	12	The hand three times.
1	5	10	13	In like manner (he shall clean himself with earth and water after voiding) faeces.
1	5	10	14	The number (of the applications of both is) thrice three for both feet and the hand.
1	5	10	15	After an effusion of semen (he shall purify himself) in the same manner as after voiding urine.
1	5	10	16	He shall wash himself, after he has untied or put on the cloth round his loins,
1	5	10	17	Or he may touch moist grass, cowdung, or earth.
1	5	10	18	While he is engaged in (the performance of) religious rites, he shall avoid to touch (the part of his body) below the navel.
1	5	10	19	The Veda (declares), 'A man's (body) is pure above the navel, it is impure below the navel.'
1	5	10	20	Sûdras living in the service of Âryans shall trim (their hair and nails) every month; their mode of sipping water (shall be) the same as that of Âryans.
1	5	10	21	A Vaisya may live by usury.
1	5	10	22	But (a sum of) twenty-five (kârshâpanas shall bear an interest) of five mâshas (per mensem).
1	5	10	23	Now they quote also (the following verses) 'He who, acquiring property cheap, employs (it so that it yields) a higher price, is called a usurer, and blamed in all (treatises on) the sacred law.' '(Brahman) weighed in the scales the crime of killing a learned Brâhmana against (the crime of) usury; the slayer of the Brâhmana remained at the top, the usurer sank downwards.'
1	5	10	24	'Let him treat Brâhmanas who tend cattle, those who live by trade, (and) those who are artisans, actors (and bards), servants or usurers, like Sûdras.'
1	5	10	25	But men of the first two castes may, at their pleasure, lend (money at interest) to one who neglects his sacred duties, to a miser, to an atheist, or to a very wicked man.
1	5	10	26	Through the neglect of sacrifices, of (lawful) marriages, of the study of the Veda, and of (learned) Brâhmanas, (noble) families (even) are degraded.
1	5	10	27	The offence of neglecting a Brâhmana cannot be committed against a fool who is unacquainted with the Veda. For (in offering sacrifices) one does not pass by a brilliant fire and throw the oblations into ashes.
1	5	10	28	Families which are deficient in (the knowledge of) the Veda, are degraded by (keeping) cows, horses and vehicles, by agriculture and by serving the king.
1	5	10	29	But even poor families which are rich in (the knowledge of) the Veda obtain rank among the (noble) families and gain great fame.
1	5	10	30	The (study of) the Veda impedes (the pursuit of) agriculture, (the pursuit of) agriculture impedes (the study of) the Veda. He who is able (to do it), may attend to both; but he who is unable (to attend to both), shall give up agriculture.
1	5	10	31	A fat, bellowing, raging humped bull, who does not restrain himself, who hurts living creatures and speaks according to his pleasure, forsooth, does not reach the (abode of) the gods; (but) those who are small like atoms, (being) emaciated (by austerities and fasts), go thither.
1	5	10	32	If, erring, in his youth he commits at any time good or evil acts of any kind, (they will all remain without result). (For) if in his later age he lives righteously, he will obtain (the reward of) that (virtuous conduct) alone, not (the punishments of his former) crimes.
1	5	10	33	Let him always be sorrowing in his heart, when he thinks of his sins, (let him) practise austerities and be careful; thus he will be freed from sin.
1	5	10	34	'Where drops of water touch the feet of a man who offers water for sipping to others, no defilement is caused by them. They are equally (pure) as (water) collected on the ground.'
1	5	11	1	Referring to deaths and births, they declare that the impurity of Sapindas lasts ten days; excepting officiating priests, men who have performed the initiatory ceremony of a Soma-sacrifice, and students of the Veda.
1	5	11	2	But amongst Sapindas Sapinda-relationship (extends) to the seventh person.
1	5	11	3	(If children die) before the completion of the seventh month or before teething, (the relatives) shall bathe.
1	5	11	4	In (the case of a child) that dies before the completion of its third year or before teething, offerings of funeral cakes and water are not prescribed, and one should not burn its (body);
1	5	11	5	Nor when unmarried maidens die.
1	5	11	6	Some do it in the case of married daughters.
1	5	11	7	That (is done) in order to gain the good-will of the people. Women are considered to have no business with the sacred texts.
1	5	11	8	'The relatives of unmarried women become pure after three days. But the uterine brothers become pure by (following) the rule mentioned before.'
1	5	11	9	Moreover, the great-grandfather, the grand-father, the father, oneself, the uterine brothers, the son by a wife of equal caste, the grandson, (and) the great-grandson--these they call Sapindas, but not the (great-grandson's) son;--and amongst these a son and a son's son (together with their father are) sharers of an undivided oblation.
1	5	11	10	The sharers of divided oblations they call Sakulyas.
1	5	11	11	If no other (relations) are living, the property (of a deceased male) descends to them (the Sapindas).
1	5	11	12	On failure of Sapindas, the Sakulyas (inherit).
1	5	11	13	On failure of them, the teacher who (holds the place of a spiritual) father, a pupil, or an officiating priest shall take it,
1	5	11	14	On failure of them, the king. Let him give that property to persons well-versed in the three Vedas.
1	5	11	15	But the king should never take for himself the property of a Brâhmana.
1	5	11	16	Now they quote also (the following verse): The property of a Brâhmana destroys (him whotakes it), together with sons and grandsons; poison kills one man only. (Therefore) they do not declare poison to be (the worst) poison. The property of a Brâhmana is called (the worst) poison.'
1	5	11	17	If a birth and a death occur together, one. and the same period of ten (days and) nights (shall serve for both).
1	5	11	18	Now if (other deaths or births) happen before the completion of the ten (days and) nights (of impurity), the first period of ten (days and) nights (shall suffice, provided the new cause of impurity occurs) before the end of the ninth day.
1	5	11	19	On a birth, indeed, the parents (alone) become impure during ten days.
1	5	11	20	Some (declare that) the mother (alone becomes impure), because (people) avoid (lying-in women alone).
1	5	11	21	Others (say that) the father (alone becomes impure) because the semen is the chief cause (of the generation).
1	5	11	22	For sons who were born without mothers, are mentioned in the revealed texts.
1	5	11	23	But (the correct opinion is that) both the parents (become impure) because they are equally connected (with the event).
1	5	11	24	But when a death (has happened, the relatives of the deceased), allowing the youngest to begin, shall pass their sacrificial threads over the right shoulder and under the left arm, descend into the water at a bathing-place, submerge (their bodies), emerge (out of the water), ascend the bank, sip water, pour out libations for the (deceased, repeating the last four acts) severally three times thereafter, ascend the bank, sip water, touch a coal, water or the like at the door of their house, and sit during ten days on mats, eating food that does not contain pungent condiments or salt.
1	5	11	25	(Let him perform) a funeral sacrifice on the eleventh or the twelfth (day).
1	5	11	26	In (performing) the remaining rites (one should) conform to (the customs of) the people.
1	5	11	27	In case of a (death) let him also keep (a period of impurity) for (persons who are) not (his) Sapindas, according to the degree of nearness, three (days and) nights, a day and a night, one day and so forth,
1	5	11	28	For a teacher, a sub-teacher (upâdhyâya), and their sons, three (days and) nights,
1	5	11	29	Likewise for officiating priests,
1	5	11	30	Let hire keep. on account of a pupil, for one who has the same spiritual guide, for a fellow-student (sabrahmakârin) three (days and) nights, one day and a night, one day and so forth (as periods of impurity).
1	5	11	31	On a miscarriage females (remain impure) as many (days and) nights as months (elapsed after conception).
1	5	11	32	If he unintentionally touches the corpse of a stranger, he becomes at once pure after bathing dressed in his clothes.
1	5	11	33	(If he does it) intentionally, (he will remain impure) during three (days and) nights.
1	5	11	34	And (the same rules apply if he touches a woman) during her courses.
1	5	11	35	A son who is born from (intercourse with a temporarily unclean woman) becomes an Abhisasta. Thereby the penances (to be performed) by him have been explained.
1	5	11	36	On touching one who sells the Veda, a sacrificial post, an outcast, a funeral pile, a dog, or a Kandâla he shall bathe.
1	5	11	37	Now if a worm is produced in an open wound that is filled with pus and sanies, how shall, in that case, a penance be performed?
1	5	11	38	He who is bitten by a worm will become pure on bathing (daily) during three days and drinking (a mixture of) cow's urine, cowdung, milk, sour milk, butter, and water boiled with Kusa grass.
1	5	11	39	He who has been touched by a dog shall bathe dressed in his clothes;
1	5	11	40	Or he becomes pure by washing that spot (where he has been touched), by touching it with fire, by (afterwards) again washing it and his feet, and by sipping water.
1	5	11	41	Now they quote also (the following verses): 'But a Brâhmana who has been bitten by a dog, is purified if he goes to a river that flows into the ocean, (bathes there and) suppresses his breath one hundred times and (afterwards) eats clarified butter. He will (also) become pure at, once on bathing (in water brought) in golden or silver (vessels), or in a cow's horn, or in new (earthen pots).'
1	5	12	1	Tame animals must not be eaten,
1	5	12	2	Nor carnivorous and (tame) birds,
1	5	12	3	Nor (tame) cocks and pigs;
1	5	12	4	Goats and sheep (are) excepted (from the above prohibition).
1	5	12	5	Five five-toed animals may be eaten, (viz.) the porcupine, the iguana, the hare, the hedgehog, the tortoise and the rhinoceros, excepting the rhinoceros,
1	5	12	6	Likewise five animals with cloven hoofs, (viz.) the white-footed antelope (Nîl-gâi), the (common ravine) deer, the spotted deer, the buffalo, the (wild) boar and the black antelope, excepting the black antelope,
1	5	12	7	(Likewise) five (kinds of) birds that feed scratching with their feet, (viz.) the partridge, the blue rock-pigeon, the francoline partridge, the (crane called) Vârdhrânasa, the peacock and the Vârana, excepting the Vârana,
1	5	12	8	(And the following) fishes, (viz.) the Silurus Pelorius (Sahasradamshtrin), the Kilikima, the Varmi, the Brihakkhiras, the Masakari(?), the Cyprinus Rohita, and the Râgi.
1	5	12	9	The milk of a (female animal) whose offspring is not ten days old, and of one that gives milk while big with a young one, must not be drunk,
1	5	12	10	Nor that of a (cow) that has no calf or that (suckles) a strange calf.
1	5	12	11	(The milk) of sheep, camels, and one-hoofed animals must not be drunk.
1	5	12	12	If (he has) drunk (milk) which ought not to be drunk, excepting cow's milk, (he must perform) a Krikkhra (penance).
1	5	12	13	But if (he has drunk) cow's milk (that is unfit for use, he shall) fast during three (days and) nights.
1	5	12	14	Stale (food must not be eaten or drunk) excepting pot-herbs, broths, meat, clarified butter, cooked grain, molasses, sour milk, and barley-meal,
1	5	12	15	Nor (substances) which have turned sour, nor molasses which have come into that state.
1	5	12	16	After performing the ceremony preparatory to the beginning of the Veda-study (upâkarman) on the (full moon of the month) of Srâvana or of Ashâdha, they shall close the term on the full moon of Taisha or Mâgha.
1	6	13	1	The gods enjoy a pure sacrifice (only);
1	6	13	2	For the gods are desirous of purity and (themselves) pure.
1	6	13	3	The following (Rik) declares that, 'To you, O Maruts, the pure ones, pure viands; to you, the pure ones, I offer a pure sacrifice. They who love the pious rites, who are of pure origin, (themselves) pure and purifiers (of others), came duly to the truthful (worshipper).'
1	6	13	4	(He will be) pure (if there is) no blemish on his clothes, therefore let him perform all (acts) that are connected with sacrificing, (dressed) in unblemished clothes.
1	6	13	5	The sacrificer and his wife as well as the officiating priests shall put on dresses which have been washed, and dried by the wind, and which are not in a bad condition.
1	6	13	6	(It shall be) thus from the (beginning of the) Prakrama,
1	6	13	7	And thus at the long Soma-sacrifices and the Sattras;
1	6	13	8	And (on other occasions other dresses must be used) in accordance with the injunction (of the Veda),
1	6	13	9	Thus at (all) Ishtis, animal sacrifices, and Soma-sacrifices which may be used as spells (against enemies), the priests shall perform (the sacred rites), wearing red turbans and red dresses; (when reciting the hymn seen by) Vrishâkapi (he shall) wear a dress and a mantle of many colours and so forth.
1	6	13	10	At the Agnyâdhâna (sacrifice) the clothes (shall be made) of flax; on failure of such, (dresses) made of cotton or of wool are used.
1	6	13	11	Clothes defiled by urine, ordure, blood, semen and the like (shall be) cleaned with earth, water and the like.
1	6	13	12	(Dresses) made of Tripa-bark and vrikala (shall be treated) like cotton-cloth,
1	6	13	13	Deer-skins like (dresses) made of bark.
1	6	13	14	(Let him) not (use) a mantle which has been wrapped (round the loins, or) on which he has been lying (in his bed), without washing it.
1	6	13	15	: Let him not employ for the gods anything used by men without beating it on a stone.
1	6	13	16	If solid earth is defiled, (it must be) smeared with cowdung.
1	6	13	17	Loose (earth must be cleansed by) ploughing,
1	6	13	18	Moist (earth) by bringing pure (earth) and covering (it with that).
1	6	13	19	Land is purified in four (ways), by being trod on by cows, by digging, by lighting a fire on it, by rain falling on it,
1	6	13	20	Fifthly by smearing it with cowdung, and sixthly through (the lapse of) time.
1	6	13	21	Grass placed on unconsecrated ground (must be) washed.
1	6	13	22	(Grass) defiled out of one's sight, (shall be) sprinkled (with water).
1	6	13	23	Small pieces of sacred fuel (shall be purified) in the same manner.
1	6	13	24	Large pieces of wood (must be) washed and dried.
1	6	13	25	But a great quantity (of wood shall be) sprinkled (with water).
1	6	13	26	Wooden vessels which have been touched by impure men (shall be) scraped;
1	6	13	27	(And) those which are defiled by stains of remnants (shall be) planed.
1	6	13	28	(Wooden vessels) defiled by urine, ordure, blood, semen, and the like (very impure substances shall be) thrown away.
1	6	13	29	These (rules must be followed) except in case a (special) injunction (is given);
1	6	13	30	Thus, for instance, (purification by) washing with Kusa grass and water (is prescribed) on all the following (occasions, viz.) at the Agnihotra, the Gharmokkhishta, the Dadhigharma, the Kundapâyinâm Ayana, the Utsarginâm Ayana, the Dâkshâyana sacrifice, the Ardhodaya, the Katuskakra, and the Brahmaudanas,
1	6	13	31	(Again) at all Soma-sacrifices (the cups must be) cleaned with water only on (the heap of earth called) the Mârgâliya;
1	6	13	32	If these same (cups are defiled) by urine, ordure, blood, semen, and the like (they must be) thrown away.
1	6	14	1	Earthen vessels that have been touched by impure persons (must be) exposed to (the flame of) a fire of Kusa grass.
1	6	14	2	Those which have been defiled by stains of remnants (of food must be) exposed to another burning.
1	6	14	3	Those which have been defiled by urine, ordure, blood, semen, and the like (must be) thrown away.
1	6	14	4	(Vessels) made of metal (must be) washed, after having been scrubbed as (directed) above.
1	6	14	5	The materials (to be used) for scrubbing (are) cowdung, earth, ashes, and so forth.
1	6	14	6	Those which have been defiled by urine, ordure, blood, semen, and the like (must be) recast,
1	6	14	7	Or (they must) be kept during seven (days and) nights completely immersed in cow's urine,
1	6	14	8	Or in a great river for as long (a period).
1	6	14	9	(Vessels) made of stone or of fruits, (i.e.) gourds, Bel-fruit, and Vinâlas, (shall be) brushed with (a brush of) cow's hair.
1	6	14	10	(Sacrificial implements made of) plaited Nala-reeds, bamboo, or Sara-reeds (shall be) washed with cowdung, water, and the like.
1	6	14	11	If unhusked rice has been defiled, (it must be) washed (and afterwards be) dried.
1	6	14	12	But a great quantity (of unhusked rice must be) sprinkled.
1	6	14	13	Husked rice (which has been defiled must be) thrown away.
1	6	14	14	The same (rule applies) to cooked sacrificial viands.
1	6	14	15	But if a great quantity has been defiled by (the touch of) dogs, crows, and the like (unclean beings), one must throw away that portion (as) food for men, and sprinkle (the rest with water), reciting the Anuvâka, 'Pavamânah suvarganah.'
1	6	14	16	Hydromel and preparations of milk (are) purified by pouring them from one vessel into another.
1	6	14	17	In like manner let him pour oil and clarified butter which have been touched by an impure (person) into water, and (afterwards) use them.
1	6	14	18	If (any) impure (substance) is thrown (into the sacrificial fire) let him place (the two Aranis one) on (the other), produce fire by friction, (and offer) a Pavamâneshti.
1	6	14	19	If (the rules regarding) purity, the proper place, the mantras, the series of actions, the object, the materials, (their) consecration, and the proper time are conflicting, each earlier-named (point) is more important (than the following ones).
1	7	15	1	The sacred fires (shall be) approached from the north,
1	7	15	2	(And be) left in the same manner.
1	7	15	3	The contrary (proceeding should be adopted at sacrifices offered) to the manes.
1	7	15	4	Let him wash that which has been touched with (his) foot.
1	7	15	5	Let him touch water, in case he touches his body or the hem (of his garment).
1	7	15	6	: Likewise (let him touch water) after cutting, splitting, digging or removing (anything, or offering oblations) to the manes, to the Râkshasas, to Nirriti, to Rudra, (and after performing sacrifices) intended as spells (against enemies).
1	7	15	7	Let him not turn round himself a sacrificial implement (the use of) which is accompanied by the recitation of mantras.
1	7	15	8	(For) the sacrificial implements (are) more nearly (connected with the sacrifice),
1	7	15	9	The priests, more remotely.
1	7	15	10	The sacrificer and his wife are even nearer than the priests.
1	7	15	11	After the sacrificial implements (follows) the clarified butter, after the clarified butter the sacrificial viands, after the sacrificial viands the animal to be slain, after the animal the Soma, after the Soma the sacred fires.
1	7	15	12	If there is work for them, the priests shall not turn away from the sacred fires.
1	7	15	13	If he faces the east, let him turn towards his right shoulder,
1	7	15	14	If he faces the west, towards the left.
1	7	15	15	The entrance to the sacrificial (enclosure lies) between the Kâtvâla and the Utkara,
1	7	15	16	(When one comes) from the Kâtvâla, (it lies between) the Âhavanîya fire and the Utkara.
1	7	15	17	The officiating (priests), the sacrificer, and his wife shall enter by that (road),
1	7	15	18	As long as the sacrificial rite is not completed.
1	7	15	19	When it has been finished (they shall) pass to and fro on the side where there is no Utkara (i.e. on the western side of the enclosure).
1	7	15	20	Let him not put on the fire logs or Samidhs which have not been sprinkled (with water),
1	7	15	21	The Brahman (priest) and the sacrificer shall enter in front of the Âhavanîya fire.
1	7	15	22	Some (declare that they shall enter) behind the Âhavanîya fire.
1	7	15	23	The seat of the Brahman (priest is situated) to the south of the Âhavanîya fire, (that) of the sacrificer to the west of him.
1	7	15	24	(The seat) of the Hotri (priest is situated) to the north of the northern Sroni (of the Vedi),
1	7	15	25	(That) of the Âgnîdhra priest near the Utkara,
1	7	15	26	(That) of the (sacrificer's) wife behind the Gârhapatya fire.
1	7	15	27	He scatters Darbha grass on these (seats) as often as (they are used).
1	7	15	28	A vessel filled with water, for the purpose of sipping, shall be appropriated to (the use of) each (person).
1	7	15	29	He who has been initiated (to the performance of a sacrifice shall) keep the (following) vows:
1	7	15	30	Let him not proclaim the guilt of other men; let him not become angry; let him not weep; let him not look at urine and ordure.
1	7	15	31	If he has looked at any unclean (substance), he mutters (the verse), 'Unrestrained is the internal organ, wretched (my) eye-sight; the sun is the chief of the (heavenly) lights; O Dîkshâ, do not forsake me!'
1	8	16	1	There are four castes (varna, viz.) Brâhmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, and Sûdras.
1	8	16	2	(Males) belonging to them (may take) wives according to the order of the castes, (viz.) a Brâhmana four,
1	8	16	3	A Kshatriya three,
1	8	16	4	A Vaisya two,
1	8	16	5	A Sûdra one.
1	8	16	6	Sons begotten on (wives) of equal or of the next lower castes (are called) Savarnas (of equal caste).
1	8	16	7	(Those born) of (wives) of the second or third lower castes (become) Ambashthas, Ugras, and Nishâdas.
1	8	16	8	Of females wedded in the inverse order of the castes (are born) Âyogavas, Mâgadhas, Vainas, Kshattris, Pulkasas, Kukkutakas, Vaidehakas, and Kandâlas.
1	8	16	9	An Ambashtha (begets) on a female of the first (caste) a Svapâka,
1	8	16	10	An Ugra on a female of the second (caste) a Vaina,
1	8	16	11	A Nishâda on a female of the third (caste) a Pulkasa.
1	8	16	12	In the contrary case a Kukkutaka (is produced).
1	8	16	13	.      .      .      .      .      .      .      .      .      .      .      .      .      .      .      .      .

1	8	16	16	Now they quote also (the following verse).: But those sons whom an uninitiated man begets, the wise call Vrâtyas, who are excluded from the Sâvitrî; (that is a rule which refers) in an equal manner to the three (highest) castes.'
1	9	17	1	The Rathakâra (carpenter), the Ambashtha, the Sûta (charioteer), the Ugra, the Mâgadha, the Âyogava, the Vaina, the Kshattri, the Pulkasa, the Kukkuta, the Vaidehaka, the Kandâla, and so forth,
1	9	17	2	Among these, sons of equal caste (spring) from women of equal caste.
1	9	17	3	A Brâhmana (begets) on a female of the Kshatriya caste a Brâhmana, on a female of the Vaisya caste an Ambashtha, on a female of the Sûdra caste a Nishâda,
1	9	17	4	(According to) some a Pârasava.
1	9	17	5	A Kshatriya (begets) on a female of the Vaisya caste a Kshatriya, on a female of the Sûdra caste an Ugra.
1	9	17	6	A Vaisya (begets) on a female of the Sûdra caste a Rathakâra.
1	9	17	7	A Sûdra begets on a female of the Vaisya caste a Mâgadha, on a female of the Kshatriya caste a Kshattri, but on a female of the Brâhmana caste a Kandâla.
1	9	17	8	A Vaisya begets on a female of the Kshatriya caste an Âyogava, on a female of the Brâhmana caste a Sûta.
1	9	17	9	If among these an Ambashtha (male) and an Ugra (female) unite, (their son) will be born in the direct order of the castes (Anuloma).
1	9	17	10	If a Kshattri (male) and a Vaidehaka (female) unite, (their son will be) born against the order of the castes (Pratiloma).
1	9	17	11	An Ugra (begets) on a female of the Kshattri caste a Svapâka,
1	9	17	12	A Vaidehaka on a female of the Ambashtha caste a Vaina,
1	9	17	13	A Nishâda on a female of the Sûdra caste a Pulkasa,
1	9	17	14	A Sûdra on a female of the Nishâda caste a Kukkutaka.
1	9	17	15	The wise declare those sprung from an inter-mixture of the castes to be Vrâtyas.
1	10	18	1	Let the king protect (his) subjects, receiving as his pay a sixth part (of their incomes or spiritual merit).
1	10	18	2	Brahman, forsooth, placed its majesty in the Brâhmanas, together with (the duties and privileges of) studying, teaching, sacrificing for themselves, sacrificing for others, liberality, and accepting (gifts), for the protection of the Vedas;
1	10	18	3	In the Kshatriyas (it placed) strength, together with (the duties and privileges of) studying, sacrificing, liberality, (using) weapons, and protecting the treasure (and the life of) created beings, for the growth of (good) government;
1	10	18	4	In the Vaisyas (it placed the power of work), together with (the duties of) studying, sacrificing, liberality, cultivating (the soil), trading, and tending cattle, for the growth of (productive) labour.
1	10	18	5	On the Sûdras (it imposed the duty of) serving the three higher (castes).
1	10	18	6	For (the Veda states), 'they were created from the feet (of Brahman).'
1	10	18	7	Let (the king) choose a domestic priest (who shall be) foremost in all (transactions).
1	10	18	8	Let him act according to his instructions.
1	10	18	9	Let him not turn back in battle.
1	10	18	10	Let him not strike with barbed or poisoned (weapons).
1	10	18	11	Let him not fight with those who are in fear, intoxicated, insane or out of their minds, (nor with those) who have lost their armour, (nor with) women, infants, aged men, and Brâhmanas,
1	10	18	12	Excepting assassins (âtatâyin).
1	10	18	13	Now they quote also (the following verse): 'He who slays an assassin, able to teach (the Veda) and born in a (noble) family, does not (incur) by that (act the guilt of) the murderer of a learned Brâhmana; (in) that (case) fury recoils upon fury.'
1	10	18	14	The duty on goods imported by sea is, after deducting a choice article, ten Panas in the hundred.
1	10	18	15	Let him also lay just (duties) on other (marketable goods) according to their intrinsic value without oppressing (the traders).
1	10	18	16	Let the king guard the property of men belonging to a non-Brâhmanical caste, the owner of which has disappeared, during a year, and afterwards take it (for himself).
1	10	18	17	A Brâhmana, forsooth, shall not suffer corporal punishment for any offence.
1	10	18	18	In case (a Brâhmana) has slain a Brâhmana, has violated his Guru's bed, has stolen the gold (of a Brâhmana), or has drunk (the spirituous liquor called) Surâ, (the king) shall cause to be impressed with a heated iron the mark of a headless trunk, a female part, a jackal, (or) the sign of a tavern on the forehead (of the offender) and banish him from his realm.
1	10	18	19	If a Kshatriya or (a man of any) other (lower caste) has murdered a Brâhmana, death and the confiscation of all his property (shall be his punishment).
1	10	18	20	If those same (persons) slay men of equal or lower castes, (the king) shall fix suitable punishments in accordance with their ability.
1	10	19	1	For slaying a Kshatriya (the offender) shall give to the king one thousand cows and besides a bull in expiation of his sin,
1	10	19	2	For (slaying) a Vaisya one hundred cows, for (slaying) a Sûdra ten; and a bull (must be) added (in each case).
1	10	19	3	(The punishment for) the murder of a woman--excepting a (Brâhmanî) who had bathed after temporary uncleanness--and for the destruction of a cow have been explained by the (rule regarding the) murder of a Sûdra.
1	10	19	4	If he has slain a milch-cow or a draught-ox, he shall perform a Kândrâyana (lunar penance) after (paying the prescribed fine).
1	10	19	5	The (punishment for the) murder of a (Brâhmanî) who had bathed after temporary uncleanness has been explained by (the rule regarding) the murder of a Kshatriya.
1	10	19	6	For killing a flamingo, a Bhâsa, a peacock, a Brâhmanî duck, a Prakalâka, a crow, an owl, a frog, a musk-rat, a dog, (the large ichneumon called) Babhru, a common ichneumon, and so forth, (the offender shall pay) the same (fine) as (for the murder of) a Sûdra.
1	10	19	7	In order to gain the good opinion of men, a witness shall give evidence in accordance with what he has seen or heard.
1	10	19	8	Of injustice (in decisions) one quarter falls on the party in the cause, one quarter on his witnesses, one quarter on all the judges, and one quarter on the king. But where he who deserves condemnation is condemned, the king is guiltless and the judges free from blame; the guilt falls on the offender (alone).
1	10	19	9	(Therefore) a wise man should ask an appointed witness in the following manner:
1	10	19	10	'The merit which thou hast acquired in the interval between the night in which thou wast born and that in which thou wilt die, all that will go to the king, if thou speakest an untruth.'
1	10	19	11	'A witness who speaks falsely, slays three fathers and three grandfathers and seven (descendants), both the born and the unborn.'
1	10	19	12	'By false testimony concerning gold he kills three ancestors; by false testimony regarding (small) cattle he kills five; by false testimony concerning kine he kills ten.' 'He kills a hundred by false evidence regarding horses, (and) a thousand by false evidence concerning a man. A witness Who speaks falsely, destroys the whole (world) by false evidence concerning land.'
1	10	19	13	(Men of) the four castes (varna) who have sons may be witnesses excepting Srotriyas, the king, ascetics, and those who are destitute of human (intellect).
1	10	19	14	If (the witness rightly) recollects (the facts of) the case (he will receive) commendation from the most eminent men.
1	10	19	15	In the contrary case (he will) fall into hell.
1	10	19	16	Let him (who has given false evidence), drink hot milk during twelve (days and) nights or offer burnt oblations (reciting) the Kûshmânda (texts).
1	11	21	1	The Veda declares, The quality of the offspring depends on the quality of the marriage rite.'
1	11	21	2	Now they quote also (the following verses): 'It is declared that a female who has been purchased for money is not a wife. She cannot (assist) at sacrifices offered to the gods or the manes. Kâsyapa has stated that she is a slave.'
1	11	21	3	'Those wicked men who, seduced by greed, give away a daughter for a fee, who (thus) sell themselves and commit a great crime, fall (after death) into a dreadful place of punishment and destroy their family down to the seventh (generation). Moreover they will repeatedly die and be born again. All (this) is declared (to happen), if a fee (is taken).'
1	11	21	4	On the day of the full moon, on the eighth day (of each half month), on the day of the new moon, on the appearance of a meteor, on the occasion of an earthquake, on visiting a burial-ground, and on the death of the king of the country, of a Srotriya or of one who has the same Guru (satîrthya), the study of the Veda must be discontinued for a day and a night.
1	11	21	5	(The study of the Veda must be interrupted) while (a strong) wind (blows), a foul smell (is perceptible), or hoar-frost (lies on the ground), when dancing (is going on), and while the sounds of singing, musical instruments, weeping, or of the Sâman (melodies are audible).
1	11	21	6	When thunder, lightning, and rain come together, (the interruption shall last) three days except in the rainy season.
1	11	21	7	In the rainy season, too, (the reading must be interrupted) until the same hour of the (next) day or night, (if thunder and lightning come together), not on account of rain.
1	11	21	8	If (he has) received anything or dined on the occasion of a sacrifice in honour of the manes, (he shall not read) during the remainder of the day,
1	11	21	9	(Nor) after meals until (the food) has been digested.
1	11	21	10	For the hand of a Brâhmana is his mouth.
1	11	21	11	Now they quote also (the following verse): According to the revealed texts there is no difference whether one has eaten or received (a present at a Srâddha).'
1	11	21	12	(A student shall discontinue the study of the Veda) during three days in case his father has died.
1	11	21	13	'Of two kinds, forsooth, is the virile energy of a famous Brâhmana who is learned in the Vedas, (that which resides) above the navel and the other (that resides) below the' navel. Through that which (resides) above the navel, his offspring is produced when he initiates Brâhmanas, when he teaches them, when he causes them to offer sacrifices, when he makes them holy. All these are his children. But through that which resides below the navel the children of his body are produced. Therefore they never say to a Srotriya who is versed in the Vedas, 'Thou art destitute of offspring.'
1	11	21	14	'Therefore a Brâhmana has two names, two mouths, two kinds of virile energy, and two births.'
1	11	21	15	(Let him discontinue the recitation of the Veda) as long as he is within hearing or sight of Sûdras and Apapâtras.
1	11	21	16	When at night the howl of a solitary jackal is heard, he shall not study until he has slept.
1	11	21	17	Let him not study in the evening and morning twilights nor on the Parva-days.
1	11	21	18	He shall not eat meat nor approach his wife (on those days).
1	11	21	19	It is declared in the Veda, 'For on the Parva-days the Râkshasas and the Pisâkas roam about (in order to injure men).'
1	11	21	20	And on (the appearance of) other omens and portents (he shall not repeat the Veda), except mentally, during a day and a night.
1	11	21	21	The mental recitation of the Veda must also be interrupted on births and deaths (occurring in the family).
1	11	21	22	Now they quote also (the following verse): 'The eighth day destroys the teacher, the fourteenth destroys the pupil, the fifteenth destroys learning; therefore let him avoid (studying the Veda) on the Parva-days.'
2	1	1	1	Now, therefore, the penances (will be described).
2	1	1	2	The murderer of a learned Brâhmana (shall practise the following vow) during twelve years:
2	1	1	3	Carrying a skull (instead of a dish) and the foot of a bedstead (instead of a staff), dressed in the hide of an ass, staying in the forest, making a dead man's skull his flag, he shall cause a hut to be built in a burial-ground and reside there; going to seven houses in order to beg food, while proclaiming his deed, he shall support life with what (he gets there), and shall fast if he obtains nothing;
2	1	1	4	Or he may offer a horse-sacrifice, a Gosava, or an Agnishtut
2	1	1	5	Or he may bathe (with the priests) on the completion of a horse-sacrifice (offered by somebody else).
2	1	1	6	Now they quote also (the following verses): 'He who unintentionally slays a Brâhmana becomes sinful according to the sacred law. The sages declare that he may be purified (if he did it) unintentionally. But no expiation is found for a wilful murderer.'
2	1	1	7	He who has raised his hand (against a Brâhmana), shall perform a Krikkhra penance, an Atikrikkhra penance if he strikes, a Krikkhra and a Kândrâyana if blood flows. Therefore let him neither raise his hand nor cause blood to flow.'
2	1	1	8	(For killing) a Kshatriya (he shall keep the normal vow of continence) during nine years,
2	1	1	9	(For killing) a Vaisya during three (years),
2	1	1	10	(For killing) a Sûdra during one year,
2	1	1	11	Likewise for killing a woman.
2	1	1	12	(The penance for killing) a woman who has bathed after temporary uncleanness (is) the same (as that) for (the murder of) a Brâhmana.
2	1	1	13	He who has defiled the bed of a Guru shall place himself on a heated iron bed,
2	1	1	14	Or embrace a red hot image (of a woman),
2	1	1	15	Or cutting off his organ together with the testicles and holding them in his joined hands, he shall walk towards the south-west until he falls down (dead).
2	1	1	16	A thief shall go to the king with flying hair, carrying on his shoulder a club of Sindhraka wood (and say), 'Strike me with that.' (Then the king) shall strike him.
2	1	1	17	Now they quote also (the following verses): 'A thief shall go to the king carrying a club on his shoulder (and say to him), 'Punish me with that, O king, remembering the duty of Kshatriyas.' 'Whether he be punished or be pardoned, the thief is freed from his guilt. But if the king does not punish him, that guilt of the thief falls on him.'
2	1	1	18	If he has drunk (the spirituous liquor called) Surâ, he shall scald himself to death with hot (liquor of the) same (kind).
2	1	1	19	For unintentionally drinking (Surâ), he shall perform Krikkhra penances during three months and be initiated again,
2	1	1	20	And (on this second initiation) the cutting (of the hair and nails), the vows, and (the observance of the) restrictive rules may be omitted.
2	1	1	21	Now they quote also (the following verses): 'A Brâhmana, Kshatriya, or Vaisya who has unintentionally drunk (the spirituous liquor called) Vârunî or has swallowed urine or faeces must be initiated a second time.'
2	1	1	22	'But he who drinks water which has stood in a vessel, used for keeping Surâ, shall live six days on milk in which (leaves of) the Saṅkhapushpî plant have been boiled.'
2	1	1	23	If (a pupil) who is employed by his teacher (on some errand) meets with his death, (the teacher) shall perform three Krikkhra penances.
2	1	1	24	The same (penance) is prescribed for not finishing (the education of the pupil).
2	1	1	25	If a student assists at the burial of anybody except (at that of his) mother, of his father, or of his teacher, he must begin his vow afresh.
2	1	1	26	If a (student) is sick, he may, at his pleasure, eat all the fragments of his teacher's meal as medicine.
2	1	1	27	He may physic himself with any (medicine) which he may desire.
2	1	1	28	When he is unable to move, he may worship the sun, after he has risen, reciting this (Rik verse): A swan, dwelling in purity.'
2	1	1	29	When he has spent his manly strength in the day-time, let him thrice drink water that reaches his heart, reciting the verses which contain the word retas.
2	1	1	30	A student who approaches a woman (is called) an Avakîrnin,
2	1	1	31	Let him offer an ass (in the place of) a sacrificial animal.
2	1	1	32	The sacrificial meat-cake (purodâsa shall be offered) to Nirriti, or to the Râkshasas, or to Yama.
2	1	1	33	It is declared in the Veda, 'The piece to be eaten by the sacrificer (prâsitra, shall be taken) from the organ (of the animal); and the (other) portions shall be offered in water.'
2	1	1	34	'Or he may also heap (fuel) on the fire in the night of the new moon, perform the preparatory rites required for the Darvîhoma, and offer two oblations of clarified butter (reciting these two sacred texts): "O Lust, I have broken my vow; my vow have I broken, O Lust; to Lust Svâhâ;" "O Lust, I have done evil; evil have I done, O Lust; to Lust Svâhâ."'
2	1	1	35	'After he has made the offering, he shall address the fire, closely joining his hands, turning sideways (with the following texts): "May the Maruts grant me, may Indra, may Brihaspati, may this fire grant me long life and strength, may it make me long-lived! "'
2	1	1	36	Now the relatives shall empty (the water-pot) of a (grievous offender) at a (solemn) meeting (and he shall confess), 'I N. N. am (the perpetrator of) such and such (a deed).' After (the outcast) has performed (his penance) the Brâhmanas shall ask him who has touched water, milk, clarified butter, honey, and salt, 'Hast thou performed (thy penance)?' The other (person) shall answer, 'Om' (yes)! They shall admit him who has performed (a penance) to all sacrificial rites, making no difference (between him and others).
2	1	1	37	If he unintentionally marries a female who belongs to his own family (gotra), he shall support her, (treating her) like his mother.
2	1	1	38	If (such a woman) has borne a child; he shall perform Krikkhra penances during three months and offer (two burnt oblations reciting) the two (Mantras), 'That which is the blemish of my soul' (and) 'Fire restored my sight.'
2	1	1	39	'An elder brother whose younger brother marries first, the younger brother who marries first, the damsel wedded (by the latter), he who gives her away, and fifthly, he who sacrifices for them (at the wedding), all sink to a region of torment.'
2	1	1	40	The unmarried elder brother and the married younger brother, the giver (of the maiden) and the performer of the sacrifices become pure by undergoing a Krikkhra penance of twelve days, the female (who has been wedded to the younger brother) by (fasting during) three days.'
2	1	2	1	Now (follow the offences) causing loss of caste (patanîya),
2	1	2	2	(Viz.) making voyages by sea,
2	1	2	3	Stealing the property of a Brâhmana or a deposit,
2	1	2	4	Giving false evidence regarding land,
2	1	2	5	Trading with merchandise of any description (whether forbidden or not),
2	1	2	6	Serving Sûdras,
2	1	2	7	Begetting a son on a female of the Sûdra caste,
2	1	2	8	And becoming thereby her son.
2	1	2	9	(For those who have) committed one of these (offences the following penance is prescribed);
2	1	2	10	'They shall eat every fourth meal-time a little food, bathe at the time of the three libations (morning, noon, and evening), passing (the day) standing and (the night) sitting. After the lapse of three years they throw off their guilt.'
2	1	2	11	'A Brâhmana removes the sin which he committed by serving the black race during one day and one night, if he bathes during three years at every fourth meal-time.'
2	1	2	12	Now (follow) the minor offences, entailing loss of caste (upapâtaka),
2	1	2	13	(Viz.) intercourse with females who must not be approached (agamyâ, e.g.) cohabitation with the female friend of a female Guru, with the female friend of a male Guru, with an Apapâtra woman, and a female outcast, following the profession of medicine, sacrificing for many, living by (performances on) the stage, following the profession of a teacher of dancing, singing and acting, tending cows and buffalos, and similar (low occupations, as well as) fornication.
2	1	2	14	The expiation (prescribed) for these (offences is) to live as an outcast during two years.
2	1	2	15	Now (follow the offences) which make men impure (asukikara),
2	1	2	16	(Viz.) gambling, performing incantations, subsisting by gleaning corn though one does not perform an Agnihotra, subsisting by alms after one has finished one's studentship, living, after that has been finished, longer than four months in the house of one's teacher, and teaching such a (person who has finished his studentship), gaining one's livelihood by astrology and so forth.
2	1	2	17	But the expiation of these (offences is to perform penances) during twelve months, during twelve fortnights, during twelve times ten days, during twelve se’nnights, during twelve times three days, during twelve days, during six days, during three days, during a day and a night, during one day, in proportion to the offence committed.
2	1	2	18	Now outcasts shall live together and (together) fulfil their duties, sacrificing for each other, teaching each other, and marrying amongst each other. If they have begot sons, they shall say to them, 'Depart from among us; thus you will again reach the Âryas.'
2	1	2	19	For the organs do not become impure together with the man.
2	1	2	20	(The truth of) that may be learned from this (parallel case); a man deficient in limbs begets a son who has the full number of limbs.
2	1	2	21	Hârîta declares that this is wrong.
2	1	2	22	For wives may be (considered) similar to thevessel which contains the curds (for the sacrifice). If one makes impure milk curdle in a milk-vessel and stirs it, the Sishtas do not use the (curds thus produced) for sacred rites.
2	1	2	23	In like manner no intercourse can be held with that (offspring) which is produced from impure seed.
2	1	2	24	If they desire it, (they may perform) a penance,
2	1	2	25	(Viz. in the case of males) the third part (of the penance prescribed) for crimes causing loss of caste (patanîya); for females the third part (of that).
2	1	2	26	Now they quote also (the following verse): 'If he applies sesamum to any other purpose, but food, anointing, and charitable gifts, he will be born again as a worm and, together with his ancestors, be plunged into the ordure of dogs.'
2	1	2	27	He who sells sesamum, forsooth, sells his ancestors; he who sells rice, forsooth, sells his life; he who gives away his daughter, making a bargain, forsooth, sells portions of his spiritual merit.
2	1	2	28	Grass and wood, in its natural state, may be sold.
2	1	2	29	Now they quote also (the following verse): 'Animals that have teeth in one jaw only, as well as minerals excepting salt, and undyed thread, these, O Brâhmana, are the goods which thou art permitted to sell.'
2	1	2	30	(If he has committed) any offence excepting a mortal sin (pâtaka) he may either give to a learned Brâhmana (anûkâna) a hairy cow of brown or red-dish colour, after sprinkling her with clarified butter and scattering black sesamum seeds over her;
2	1	2	31	Or (he may offer burnt oblations), reciting the Kûshmândas, during twelve days,
2	1	2	32	'(Thus) he will be freed. from the guilt (of any crime that is) less (heinous) than the murder of a learned Brâhmana.'
2	1	2	33	If one is accused of a mortal sin (pâtaka), a Krikkhra (penance must be performed by the accused).
2	1	2	34	The accuser (shall perform) that (Krikkhra penance during) a year.
2	1	2	35	'He who during a year associates with an outcast, becomes (likewise) an outcast; not by sacrificing for him, by teaching him or by (forming) a matrimonial (alliance with him), but by using the same carriage or seat.'
2	1	2	36	The penance for eating impure substances is to fast until the entrails are empty. That is attained in seven (days and) nights.
2	1	2	37	(Subsisting on) water, milk, clarified butter, (and) fasting,--each for three days,--(and taking the three fluids) hot, that is a Taptakrikkhra penance.
2	1	2	38	(Eating) during three days in the morning only, during the (next) three days in the evening only, (subsisting) during (another) three days (on) food given unasked, and fasting during three days, (that is) a Krikkhra penance.
2	1	2	39	(If the period of twelve days is divided into) three (periods of) four days, that is the Krikkhra penance of, women, children, and aged men.
2	1	2	40	If (observing the rule given) above one eats (at each meal) so much only as one can take at one (mouthful), that is an Atikrikkhra penance.
2	1	2	41	(If one) subsists on water only, that is a Krikkhrâtikrikkhra, the third (in the order of the Krikkhra penances).
2	1	2	42	During a Krikkhra penance (the following rules must be followed, viz.) to bathe at morn, noon, and evening,
2	1	2	43	To sleep on the ground,
2	1	2	44	To wear one garment only, to shave the hair of the head, of the beard, and of the body, and to clip the nails.
2	1	2	45	The same (rules apply) to women except (that referring to) shaving the head.
2	2	3	1	A Brâhmana who always carries water (in his pot), who always wears the sacred thread, who daily recites the Veda, who avoids the food of Sûdras, who approaches (his wife) in the proper season, and offers sacrifices in accordance with the rules (of the Veda, after death) never falls from Brahman's heaven.
2	2	3	2	The Veda (says), 'Manu divided his estate among his sons.'
2	2	3	3	(A father may, therefore, divide his property) equally among all, without (making any) difference;
2	2	3	4	Or the eldest may receive the most excellent chattel.
2	2	3	5	(For) the Veda says, 'Therefore, they distinguish the eldest by (an additional share of the) property.
2	2	3	6	Or the eldest may receive (in excess) one part out of ten;
2	2	3	7	(And) the other (sons) shall receive equal shares.
2	2	3	8	While the father lives, the division of the estate takes place (only) with the permission of the father.
2	2	3	9	The (additional) share of the eldest is, (according to the order) of the four castes, a cow, a horse, a goat, and a sheep.
2	2	3	10	If there are sons born of wives of different castes (varna), they should make ten portions of the ancestral property and take four (shares), three, two, (and) one, according to the order (of the castes).
2	2	3	11	But if a legitimate son of the body (aurasa) is born, the (other) sons of equal caste shall obtain one third share (of the estate).
2	2	3	12	If there is a son of equal caste and a son of a wife of the next lower caste, the son born of the wife of the next lower caste may take the share of the eldest, provided he be endowed with good qualities.
2	2	3	13	(A son) who possesses good qualities becomes the protector of the rest.
2	2	3	14	One must know a son begotten by (the husband) himself on a wedded wife of equal caste (to be) a legitimate son of the body (aurasa). Now they quote also (the following verse): 'From the several limbs (of my body) art thou produced, from my heart art thou born; thou art "self" called a son; mayest thou live a hundred autumns.'
2	2	3	15	The (male child) born of a daughter, after an agreement has been made, (one must know to be) the son of an appointed daughter (putrikâputra); any other (male offspring of a daughter they call) a daughter's son (dauhitra).
2	2	3	16	Now they quote also (the following verse): 'The son of an appointed daughter should offer the first funeral cake to his mother, the second to her father, and the third to his father's father.'
2	2	3	17	He who is begotten, by another man, on the wife of a deceased man, of a eunuch, or of one (incurably) diseased, after permission (has been given), is called the son begotten on a wife (kshetraga).
2	2	3	18	Such a (son begotten on a wife) has two fathers and belongs to two families; he has a right to perform the funeral oblations, and to inherit the property of (his) two (fathers).
2	2	3	19	Now they quote also (the following verse): The son of two fathers shall give the funeral cakes (to his two fathers, and pronounce) two names with each oblation, and three cakes shall serve for six persons; he who acts thus will not err.'
2	2	3	20	He (is called) an adopted son (datta) who, being given by his father and his mother, or by either of the two, is received in the place of a child.
2	2	3	21	He (is called) a son made (kritrima) whom (a mail) himself makes (his son), with the (adoptee's) consent (only), and who belongs to the same caste (as the adopter).
2	2	3	22	He is called a son born secretly (gûdhagga) who is secretly born in the house and whose (origin is) afterwards (only) recognised.
2	2	3	23	He is called a son cast off (apaviddha) who, being, cast off by his father and his mother, or by either (of them), is received in the place of a child.
2	2	3	24	If anybody approaches an unmarried girl without the permission (of her father or guardian), the son born by such (a woman is called) the son of an unmarried damsel (kânîna).
2	2	3	25	If one marries either knowingly or unknowingly a pregnant bride, the child which is born of her is called (a son) taken with the bride (sahodha).
2	2	3	26	He (is called a son) bought (krîta) who, being purchased from his father and his mother, or from either of them, is received in the place of a child.
2	2	3	27	He (is called the son) of a twice-married woman (paunarbhava) who is born of a re-married female, (i.e.) of one who, having left an impotent man, has taken a second husband.
2	2	3	28	He (is called) a self-given (son, svayamdatta) who, abandoned by his father and his mother, gives himself (to a stranger).
2	2	3	29	He who is begotten by (a man of) the first twice-born (caste) on a female of the Sûdra caste (is called) a Nishâda.
2	2	3	30	(He who was begotten by the same parents) through lust (is called) a Pârasava. Thus (the various kinds of) sons (have been enumerated).
2	2	3	31	Now they quote also (the following verses): 'They declare the legitimate son, the son of an appointed daughter, the son begotten on a wife, the adopted son and the son made, the son born secretly and the son cast off, (to be entitled) to share the inheritance.'
2	2	3	32	'They declare the son of an unmarried damsel and the son received with the bride, the son bought, likewise the son of a twice-married female, the son self-given and the Nishâda, to be members of the family.'
2	2	3	33	Aupagandhani (declares that) the first among them alone (is entitled to inherit, and a member of his father's family).
2	2	3	34	'Now, O Ganaka, I jealously watch my wives, (though I did) not (do it) formerly; for they have declared in Yama's court that the son belongs to the begetter. The giver of the seed carries off the son, after death, in Yama's hall, Therefore they carefully protect their wives, fearing the seed of strangers.'
2	2	3	35	'Carefully watch (the procreation of your) offspring, lest strange seed fall on your soil. After death the son belongs to the begetter; through carelessness a husband makes (the procreation of) a son useless.'
2	2	3	36	Let them carefully protect the shares of those who are minors, as well as the increments (thereon).
2	2	3	37	Granting food, clothes, (and shelter), they shall support those who are incapable of transacting legal business,
2	2	3	38	(Viz.) the blind, idiots, those immersed in vice, the incurably diseased, and so forth,
2	2	3	39	Those who neglect their duties and occupations;
2	2	3	40	But not the outcast nor his offspring.
2	2	3	41	Intercourse with outcasts shall not take place.
2	2	3	42	But he shall support an outcast mother, without speaking to her.
2	2	3	43	The daughters shall obtain the ornaments of their mother, (as many as are) presented according to the custom (of the caste), or anything else (that may be given according to custom).
2	2	3	44	Women do not possess independence.
2	2	3	45	Now they quote also (the following verse): Their father protects (them) in childhood, their husband protects (them) in youth, and their sons protect (them) in old age a woman is never fit for independence.'
2	2	3	46	The Veda declares, 'Therefore women are considered to be destitute of strength and of a portion.'
2	2	3	47	Those (women) who strive (to do what is) agreeable to their husbands will gain heaven.
2	2	3	48	But for a violation (of their duty towards the husband) a Krikkhra penance (must be performed).
2	2	3	49	(For violating it) with a Sûdra (a woman) shall perform a lunar penance (kândrâyana);
2	2	3	50	(For violating it) against the order of the castes with a Vaisya and so forth, she shall perform a Krikkhra or an (Atikrikkhra) penance.
2	2	3	51	For male (offenders, i.e.) Brâhmanas and so forth, a year's chastity (is prescribed).
2	2	3	52	Let him burn a Sûdra (who commits adultery with an Âryan) in a straw-fire.
2	2	3	53	Now they quote also (the following verses):
2	2	4	1	'Anybody but a Brâhmana shall suffer corporal punishment for adultery.'
2	2	4	2	'The wives (of men) of all castes must be guarded more carefully than wealth.'
2	2	4	3	'But corporal punishment (shall) not (be inflicted) for (adultery with) the wives of minstrels and with those who appear on the stage. For (the husbands) carry them (to other men), or, lying concealed (at home), permit them to hold culpable intercourse.'
2	2	4	4	'Women (possess) an unrivalled means of purification; they never become (entirely) foul. For month by month their temporary uncleanness removes their sins.'
2	2	4	5	'Soma gave them cleanliness, the Gandharva their melodious voice, and Fire purity of all (limbs); therefore women are free from stains.'
2	2	4	6	'Let him abandon a barren (wife) in the tenth year, one who bears daughters (only) in the twelfth, one whose children (all) die in the fifteenth, but her who is quarrelsome without delay.'
2	2	4	7	A widow shall avoid during a year (the use of) honey, meat, spirituous liquor, and salt, and sleep on the ground.
2	2	4	8	Maudgalya (declares that she shall do so) during six months.
2	2	4	9	After (the expiration of) that (time) she may, with the permission of her Gurus, bear a son to her brother-in-law, in case she has no son.
2	2	4	10	Now they quote also (the following verse): One whose appointment can have no result, (viz.) a barren woman, one who has borne sons, one who is past child-bearing, one whose children are (all) dead, and one who is unwilling must not be appointed.'
2	2	4	11	The sister of a maternal uncle and of the father, a sister, a sister's daughter, a daughter-in-law, a maternal uncle's wife, and the wife of a friend are females who must never be approached (agamyâ).
2	2	4	12	For intercourse with females who must not be approached (agamyâ), a Krikkhra and an Atikrikkhra (and) a Kândrâyana are the penances prescribed for all.
2	2	4	13	Thereby (the rule regarding) intercourse with a female of the Kandâla caste has been declared.
2	2	4	14	Now they quote also (the following verses): A Brâhmana who unintentionally approaches a female of the Kandâla caste, eats (food given by a Kandâla) or receives (presents from him), becomes an outcast; but (if he does it) intentionally, he becomes equal (to a Kandâla).
2	2	4	15	'He who approaches his father's, his teacher's, or a king's wife, is guilty of the crime of violating a Guru's bed; the penance ordained for him has been declared above.'
2	2	4	16	(A Brâhmana) who is unable (to subsist) by teaching, sacrificing for others, or the acceptance of gifts, shall maintain himself by following the duties of Kshatriyas, because that is the next following (caste).
2	2	4	17	Gautama (declares that one shall) not (act thus). For the duties of Kshatriyas are too cruel for a Brâhmana.
2	2	4	18	Now they quote also (the following verse): 'Out of regard for the sacred law a Brâhmana and a Vaisya may take up arms for (the protection of) cows or Brâhmanas, or when a confusion of the castes (threatens to take place).
2	2	4	19	(Or) the livelihood of a Vaisya should be adopted, because that is the one following (next):
2	2	4	20	(If he lives by agriculture) he shall plough before breakfast,
2	2	4	21	With two bulls whose noses have not been pierced, not striking them with the goad, (but) frequently coaxing them.
2	2	4	22	The (sacred domestic) fire (shall be kindled) at the wedding; the religious ceremonies up to the Agnyâdheya (shall be) performed in that.
2	2	4	23	Now, beginning with the Agnyâdheya, follow these (rites in an) uninterrupted (series), as, for instance, the Agnyâdheya, the Agnihotra, the new and full moon sacrifices, the Âgraya.a at the winter and summer solstices, the animal sacrifice, the Kâturmâsyas at the beginning of each season, the Shaddhotri in spring, the Agnishtoma. Thus the attainment of bliss (is secured).
2	2	4	24	Now they quote also (the following verse): 'Neither he who is accustomed to sleep in the day-time, nor he who eats the food of anybody, nor he who falls from a height to which he has climbed, can reach heaven as he desires.'
2	2	4	25	Let him avoid meanness, hard-heartedness, and crookedness.
2	2	4	26	Now they quote also with reference to this (subject the following) verse in the dialogue between the daughters of Usanas and Vrishaparvan: 'Thou, forsooth, art the daughter of one who praises (others), who begs and accepts (gifts); but I am the child of one who is praised, who gives gifts and does not accept them.'
2	3	5	1	Bathing is suitable for (the practice of) austerity.
2	3	5	2	The libation to the manes (is offered) after the gods have been satisfied (with water),
2	3	5	3	They pour out water which gives strength, from one Tîrtha after the other.
2	3	5	4	Now they quote also (the following verses): 'With flowing, unconfined water twice-born men of the three castes shall satisfy the gods, Rishis, and manes, when they have risen in the morning.'
2	3	5	5	'They shall not offer (libations of water) con-fined (in tanks and wells), (If they do it), he who made the embankment; will obtain a share (of the merit of their devotion).'
2	3	5	6	'Therefore let him avoid embankments (around tanks) and wells made by others.'
2	3	5	7	Nov they quote also (the following verse): 'Or, in times of distress--not as a rule--he may bathe in (water) confined (in tanks), after taking out three lumps (of earth); from a well (let him take three) lumps of clay and three jars of water.'
2	3	5	8	If he has accepted presents from one who is able to give presents to many, or from one whose presents ought not to be accepted, or if he has sacrificed for one for whom he ought not to have sacrificed, or if he has eaten food (given by a person) whose food must not be eaten, he shall mutter the Taratsamandîya.
2	3	5	9	Now they quote also (the following verse): Those who improperly associate with (an outcast) teacher, those who improperly associate with (outcast) pupils, and those who improperly associate (with outcasts) by (accepting their) food or by (reciting) Mantras (for them), enter into deep darkness.'
2	3	5	10	Now (follow) the duties of a Snâtaka.
2	3	5	11	After offering at the morning and at the evening (meals) with (a portion of) the food which he may have, the Vaisvadeva and the Bali-offerings, he shall honour, according to his ability, Brâhmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, and Sûdras (who may come to his house as) guests.
2	3	5	12	If he cannot (afford to give food) to many, let him give (something) to one who possesses good qualities,
2	3	5	13	Or to him who has come first.
2	3	5	14	, If a Sûdra (has come as) a guest, he shall order him (to do some) work, (and feed him afterwards);
2	3	5	15	Or (if he cannot spare much), he may give a first portion (agrya) to a Srotriya.
2	3	5	16	It is prescribed that the division (of the food) shall be made without detriment to (the interests of) those who daily receive a portion.
2	3	5	17	But he shall never eat without having given away (some small portion of the food).
2	3	5	18	Now they quote also two verses which have been proclaimed by (the goddess of) food: 'Him who, without giving me to the gods, the manes, his servants, his guests and friends, consumes what has been prepared and (thus), in his exceeding folly, swallows poison, I consume, and I am his death. But for him who, offering the Agnihotra, performing the Vaisvadeva, and honouring guests, eats, full of contentment, purity, and faith, what remains after feeding those whom he must support, I become ambrosia, and he (really) enjoys me.'
2	3	5	19	Presents of money must be given, according to one's ability, to good Brâhmanas, Srotriyas, and Vedapâragas, when they beg outside the Vedi, for the sake of Gurus, in order to defray (the expenses of) their marriages, or of medicine, or when they are distressed for a livelihood, or desirous to offer a sacrifice, or engaged in studying, or on a journey, or have performed a Visvagit sacrifice.
2	3	5	20	Cooked food (must be given) to other (beggars).
2	3	5	21	Let him eat (seated) in a pure, enclosed place, after having well washed his hands and feet and after having sipped water, respectfully receiving the food which is brought to him, keeping himself free from lust, anger, hatred, greed, and perplexity, (conveying the food into his mouth) with all his fingers and making no noise (during mastication).
2	3	6	1	Let him not put back into the dish a remnant of food.
2	3	6	2	If he eats (food), containing meat, fish, or sesamum, he shall (afterwards) wash and touch fire,
2	3	6	3	And bathe after sunset.
2	3	6	4	Let him avoid a seat, clogs, sticks for cleaning the teeth, and other (implements) made of Palâsa wood.
2	3	6	5	Let him not eat (food placed) in his lap,
2	3	6	6	Nor on a chair,
2	3	6	7	He shall carry a staff, made of bamboo, and golden earrings.
2	3	6	8	Let him not rub one foot with the other while bathing, nor place the one on the other while standing,
2	3	6	9	Let him not wear a visible garland.
2	3	6	10	Let him not look at the sun when he rises or sets.
2	3	6	11	Let him not announce (the appearance of a rainbow) to another (man, saying), 'There is Indra's bow.'
2	3	6	12	If he points it out, he shall call it 'the jewelled bow.'
2	3	6	13	Let him not pass between the prakîlaka and the beam, at the town gate,
2	3	6	14	Nor let him pass between the two posts of a swing.
2	3	6	15	Let him not step over a rope to which a calf is tied.
2	3	6	16	Let him not step on ashes, bones, hair, chaff, potsherds, nor on a bathing-place (moist with) water.
2	3	6	17	Let him not announce it to another (man if) a cow suckles (her calf).
2	3	6	18	Let him not say of (a cow which is) not a milch-cow, 'She is not a milch-cow.'
2	3	6	19	If he speaks (of such a one), let him say, 'It is one which will become a milch-cow.'
2	3	6	20	Let him not make empty, ill-sounding, or harsh speeches.
2	3	6	21	Let him not go alone on a. journey,
2	3	6	22	Nor with outcasts, nor with a woman, nor with a Sûdra.
2	3	6	23	Let him not set out (on a journey) towards evening.
2	3	6	24	Let him not bathe (entirely) naked.
2	3	6	25	Let him not bathe at night.
2	3	6	26	Let him not cross a river swimming.
2	3	6	27	Let him not look down into a well.
2	3	6	28	Let him not look down into a pit.
2	3	6	29	Let him not sit down there, where another person may order him to rise.
2	3	6	30	Way must be made for a Brâhmana, a cow, a king, a blind man, an aged man, one who is suffering under a burden, a pregnant woman, and a weak man.
2	3	6	31	A righteous man shall seek to dwell in a village where fuel, water, fodder, sacred fuel, Kusa grass, and garlands are plentiful, access to which is easy, where many rich people dwell, which abounds in industrious people, where Âryans form the majority, and which is not easily entered by robbers.
2	3	6	32	'A Brâhmana who, having wedded a wife of the Sûdra caste and dwells during twelve years in a village where water (is obtainable) from wells only, becomes equal to a Sûdra.'
2	3	6	33	(If you say that) he who lives in a town and whose body is covered with the dust, (raised) by others, and whose eyes and mouth are filled with it, will obtain salvation, if he restrains himself, (I declare that) that is impossible.
2	3	6	34	'The dust raised by carriages, horses, elephants, and cows, and (that which comes) from grain is pure, blamed is (that raised) by a broom, goats, sheep, donkeys, and garments.'
2	3	6	35	Let him honour those who are worthy of honour.
2	3	6	36	'A Rishi, a learned man, a king, a bride-groom, a maternal uncle, a father-in-law, and an officiating priest are mentioned in the Smriti as worthy of the honey-mixture at certain times and occasions.'
2	3	6	37	'A Rishi, a learned man, and a king must be honoured whenever they come, a bridegroom and a priest at the beginning of the religious rites, a maternal uncle and a father-in-law when a year has elapsed since their last visit.'
2	3	6	38	'Let him raise his right arm on (entering) the place where the sacred fire is kept, in the midst of a herd of cows, in the presence of Brâhmanas, at the daily recitation of the Veda, and at dinner.'
2	3	6	39	'An upper garment must be worn on the following five occasions: during the daily study, during the evacuation (of excrements), when one bestows gifts, at dinner, and while one sips water.'
2	3	6	40	'While one offers oblations in the fire, while one dines, bestows gifts, offers (food to deities or Gurus), and accepts presents, (the right hand) must be placed between the knees.'
2	3	6	41	'The revealed texts declare, that the creatures depend on food, food is life; therefore gifts of food must be made. Food is the most excellent of sacrificial viands.'
2	3	6	42	'Sin is removed by burnt offerings, burnt oblations are surpassed by (gifts of) food, and gifts of food by kind speeches. That (is declared) to us in the revealed texts.'
2	4	7	1	Now, therefore, we will declare the rule for (performing) the twilight devotions.
2	4	7	2	Going to a (sacred) bathing-place, he shall bathe, in case he is impure; in case he is pure, he may, optionally, omit the bath. (But in either case) he shall wash his feet and hands. Sipping water and sprinkling himself, while he recites the (Rik-verses) containing the word Surabhi, the Abliṅgas, those addressed to Varuna, the Hiranyavarnas, the Pâvamânîs, the (sacred syllables called) Vyâhritis, and other purificatory (texts), he becomes pure (and fit to perform the twilight devotions).
2	4	7	3	Now they quote also (the following verse): 'Submersion in water (and) bathing are prescribed for all the (four) castes. But sprinkling (water over the body), while Mantras (are being recited), is the particular (duty) of the twice-born.'
2	4	7	4	He who sprinkles himself (with water) at the beginning of any sacred rite,--before the time of the twilight devotions,--while reciting that same collection of purificatory (texts), becomes pure.
2	4	7	5	Now they quote also (the following rules): Seated, with his face to the west, on Darbha grass and holding Darbha blades in his (right) hand, which is filled with water, he shall repeat the Sâvitrî one thousand times;
2	4	7	6	Or (he may recite the verse) one hundred times, suppressing his breath;
2	4	7	7	Or mentally ten times, adding the syllable Om at the beginning and at the end and the seven Vyâhritis.
2	4	7	8	And if he is tired by three suppressions of his breath (performed) with (the recitation of) the (Anuvâka called) Brahmahridaya (the heart of Brahman, then let him repeat the Sâvitrî).
2	4	7	9	In the evening he worships (the sun) with the two (verses) addressed to Varuna, 'Hear this my call, O Varuna,' and 'Therefore I go to thee.'
2	4	7	10	The same (rules apply to the twilight devotion) in the morning, (but the worshipper) shall face the east and stand upright.
2	4	7	11	In the day-time he worships (the sun) with the two (verses) addressed to Mitra, 'The glory of Mitra, who supports men,' and 'Mitra causes men to join.'
2	4	7	12	Let him begin (the twilight devotion) in the morning very early, and finish it when the sun has risen.
2	4	7	13	Let him begin (the twilight devotion) in the evening, when (the sun) has set, (and finish it) very soon after (the appearance of the stars);
2	4	7	14	And the complete observance of the twilight devotions (produces as its reward) an uninterrupted succession of days and nights.
2	4	7	15	Now they quote with reference to this (subject) also the following two verses, which have been proclaimed by the Lord of created beings (Pragâpati) 'How can those twice-born men be called Brâhmanas who do not perform their twilight devotions, in the morning and in the evening at the proper time? At his pleasure a righteous king may appoint those Brâhmanas who neglect to daily perform the twilight devotions, both at morn and at eve, to do the work of Sûdras.'
2	4	7	16	If the time for the (twilight devotion) is allowed to pass in the evening, (the offender shall) fast during the night; and if it is neglected in the morning, he shall fast during the (next) day.
2	4	7	17	He obtains (thereby) the (same) reward as if he had remained standing and sitting (in the twilight).
2	4	7	18	Now they quote also (the following verses): 'Whatever sin (a man) may have committed with his organ, with his feet, with his arms, by thoughts or by speech, from (all) that he is freed by performing the twilight devotion in the evening.'
2	4	7	19	(The worshipper) becomes also connected(thereby) with the (next) night, and Varuna will not seize him.
2	4	7	20	In like manner he becomes free from the sin committed during the night by worshipping in the morning.
2	4	7	21	He is also connected with the (next) day, Mitra protects him and Âditya leads him up to heaven.
2	4	7	22	It is declared in the Veda, 'A Brâhmana who in this same manner daily worships in the twilight, both at morn and at eve and, being sanctified by the Brahman, becoming one with the Brahman, and resplendent through the Brahman, follows the rules of the Sâstra, gains the heaven of Brahman.'
2	5	8	1	Now, after washing his hands, he shall take his waterpot and a clod of earth, go to a (sacred) bathing-place and thrice clean his feet (with earth and water) and thrice his body.
2	5	8	2	Now some say, 'One must not enter a burial-ground, water, a temple, a cowpen, nor a place where Brâhmanas (sit) without having cleaned one's feet.'
2	5	8	3	Then he enters the water, (reciting the following verse): 'I take refuge with gold-horned Varuna, give me at my request (O Varuna) a purifying bathing-place. May Indra, Varuna, Brihaspati, and Savitri again and again cleanse me from all sin which I have committed by eating the food of unholy men, by receiving gifts from the wicked, and from all evil which I have done by thoughts, speeches, or deeds.'
2	5	8	4	Then he takes up water in his joined hands, (saying), 'May the waters and the herbs be propitious to us.'
2	5	8	5	(Next) he pours (the water) out in that direction in which an enemy of his dwells, (saying), 'May they work woe to him who hates us and whom we hate.'
2	5	8	6	Then he sips water, and thrice makes the water eddy around himself turning from the left to the right (and saying), 'May that which is hurtful, which is impure, and which is inauspicious in the water be removed.'
2	5	8	7	After having submerged himself and having emerged from the water,
2	5	8	8	(Acts of) personal purification, washing the clothes by beating them on a stone and sipping water are not (permitted to the worshipper) as long as he is in the water.
2	5	8	9	If (the water used for bathing) has been (taken from a) confined (place, such as a well), he worships it with the following (Mantra): 'Adoration to Agni, the lord of the waters; adoration to Indra; adoration to Varuna; adoration to Vârunî; adoration to the waters.'
2	5	8	10	After having ascended the bank and having sipped water, let him again sip water, though he has done so before, (and recite the following Mantras) 'May water purify the earth, may the purified earth purify me, may Brahmanaspati (and) Brahman purify, may the purified (earth) purify me. May water purify me, (taking away) all (the guilt which I incurred by eating) remnants of food, and forbidden food, (by committing) evil deeds, (by) receiving gifts from wicked men, Svâhâ!'
2	5	8	11	Making two Pavitras he rubs (his body) with water. Having rubbed himself, (reciting the) three (verses), 'Ye waters are,' &c., the four (verses), 'The golden-coloured, pure, purifying,' &c., (and) the Anuvâka, 'He who purifies,' &c., he performs, stepping back into the water, three Prânâyâmas with the Aghamarshana (hymn); then he ascends the bank, squeezes (the water) out of his dress, puts on garments which have been washed and dried in the air and which are not the worse for wear, sips water, sits down on Darbha grass, and, holding Darbha grass (in his hands), recites, facing the east, the Gâyatrî one thousand times, (or) one hundred times, or any number of times, or at least twelve times.
2	5	8	12	Then he worships the sun (reciting the following Mantras): 'Out of darkness we,' &c., 'Up that bright,' &c., That eye which is beneficial to the gods,' &c., (and) 'He who rose,' &c.
2	5	8	13	Now they quote also (the following maxim): 'The syllable Om,, the Vyâhritis, and the Sâvitrî, these five Veda-offerings daily cleanse the Brâhmana from guilt.'
2	5	8	14	Being purified by the five Veda-offerings, he next satiates the gods (with water, saying),
2	5	9	1	'I satiate the deities of the eastern gate, Agni, Pragâpati, Soma, Rudra, Aditi, Brihaspati, together with the lunar mansions, with the planets, with the days and nights, and with the Muhûrtas; Om, I also satiate the Vasus;
2	5	9	2	'Om, I satiate the deities of the southern gate, the Pitris, Yama, Bhaga, Savitri, Tvashtri, Vâyu, Indrâgnî, together with the lunar mansions, with the planets, with the days and nights, and with the Muhûrtas; Om, I also satiate the Rudras.
2	5	9	3	'Om, I satiate the deities of the western gate, Mitra, Indra, the Mahâpitris, the Waters, all the gods, Brahman, Vishnu, together with the lunar mansions, with the planets, with the days and nights, and with the Muhûrtas; Om, I also satiate the Âdityas.
2	5	9	4	'Om, I satiate the deities of the northern gate, the Vasus, Varuna, Aga-ekapâd, Ahibudhnya, Ushas, the two Asvins, Yama, together with . . . . . .
2	5	9	5	'Om, I satiate all the gods; the Sâdhyas; Brahman; Pragâpati; the four-faced god; Hiranyagarbha; Svayambhû; the male attendants of Brahman; Parameshthin; the female attendants of Brahman; Agni; Vâyu; Varuna; Sûrya; the moon; the lunar mansions; Sadyogâta; Bhûh-purusha; Bhuvah-purusha; Suvah-purusha; Bhûh; Bhuvah; Suvah; Mahah; Ganah; Tapah; Satya.
2	5	9	6	'Om, I satiate the god Bhava; Sarva; Îsâna; Pasupati; Rudra; Ugra; Bhîmadeva; Mahâdeva; the wife of the god Bhava; of the god Sarva; of the god Îsâna; of the god Pasupati; of the god Rudra; of the god Ugra; of Bhîmadeva; of Mahâdeva; the son of Bhava; of Sarva; of Îsâna; of Pasupati; ofRudra; of Ugra; of Bhîmadeva; of Mahâdeva; Om, I also satiate the Rudras, the attendants of Rudra.
2	5	9	7	'Om, I satiate Vighna; Vinâyaka; Vîra; Sthûla; Varada; Hastimukha; Vakratunda; Ekadanta; Lambodara; the male attendants of Vighna; the female attendants of Vighna.
2	5	9	8	'Om, I satiate Sanatkumâra; Skanda; Indra; Shashthî; Shanmukha; Visâkha; Mahâsena; Subrahmanya; the male attendants of Skanda; the female attendants of Skanda.
2	5	9	9	'Om, I satiate Âditya; Soma; Aṅgâraka; Budha; Brihaspati; Sukra; Sanaiskara; Râhu; Ketu.To. 'Om, I satiate Kesava; Nârâyana; Mâdhava; Govinda; Vishnu; Madhusûdana; Trivikrama; Vâmana; Srîdhara; Hrishîkesa; Padmanâbha; Dâmodara; the goddess Srî; the goddess Sarasvatî; Pushti; Tushti; Vishnu; Garutmat; the male attendants of Vishnu; the female attendants of Vishnu.
2	5	9	11	'Om, I satiate Yama; Yamarâga; Dharma; Dharmarâga; Kâla; Nîla; Mrityu; Mrityuñgaya; Vaivasvata; Kitragupta; Audumbara; the male attendants of Vaivasvata; the female attendants of Vaivasvata.
2	5	9	12	'Om, I satiate the gods of the earth; Kâsyapa; Antariksha; Vidyâ; Dhanvantari; the male attendants of Dhanvantari; the female attendants of Dhanvantari.'
2	5	9	13	Next, passing the sacrificial thread round the neck, (he offers the following libations):
2	5	9	14	'Om, I satiate the Rishis; the great Rishis; the best Rishis; the Brahmarshis; the divine Rishis; the royal Rishis; the Srutarshis; the Seven Rishis;the Rishis of the Kândas (of the Yagur-veda); the Rishikas; the wives of the Rishis; the sons of the Rishis; Kanva Baudhâyana; Âpastamba, the author of the Sûtra; Satyâshâdha Hiranyakesin; Vâgasaneyin Yâgñavalkya; Âsvalâyana Saunaka; Vyâsa; the syllable Om; the Vyâhritis; the Sâvitrî; the Gâyatrî; the Khandas; the Rig-vela; the Yagur-veda; the Sâma-veda; the Atharvâṅgirasa; the Itihâsa and Purâna; all the Vedas; the servants of all gods; all beings.'
2	5	9	15	Then, passing the sacrificial string over the right shoulder, (he offers the following libations):
2	5	10	1	Om, I satiate the fathers, Svadhâ, adoration! the grandfathers; the great-grandfathers; the mothers; the grandmothers; the great-grandmothers; the maternal grandfathers; the maternal grandmother; the mother's grandmother; the mother's great-grandmother.
2	5	10	2	'Om, I satiate the teacher (âkârya), Svadhâ, adoration! the wife of the teacher; the friends; the wives of the friends; the relatives; the wives of the relatives; the inmates of the house (amâtya); the wives of the inmates of the house; all; the wives of all.'
2	5	10	3	He pours the water out from the several Tîrthas (of the hand sacred to the several deities).
2	5	10	4	(He recites at the end of the rite the following [paragraph continues] Mantra): '(Ye waters), who bring food, ambrosia, clarified butter, milk, and barley-gruel, are food for the manes; satiate my ancestors! May you be satiated, may you be satiated!'
2	5	10	5	Let him not perform ceremonies in honour of the gods while his clothes are wet, or while he is dressed in one garment only,.
2	5	10	6	Nor those connected with the manes. That is the opinion) of some (teachers).
2	6	11	1	Now these five great sacrifices, which are also called the great sacrificial sessions, are the sacrifice to be offered to the gods, the sacrifice to be offered to the manes, the sacrifice to be offered to all beings, the sacrifice to be offered to men, (and) the sacrifice to be offered to Brahman,
2	6	11	2	Let him daily offer (something to the gods with the exclamation) Svâhâ, be it only a piece of fuel. Thereby he performs that sacrifice to the gods.
2	6	11	3	Let him daily offer (something to the manes with the exclamation) Svadhâ, be it only a vessel filled with water. Thereby he performs that sacrifice to the manes.
2	6	11	4	Let him daily pay reverence to (all beings) endowed with life. Thereby he performs that sacrifice to the beings.
2	6	11	5	Let him daily give food to Brâhmanas, be it only roots, fruit, or vegetables. Thereby he performs that sacrifice to men.
2	6	11	6	Let him daily recite the Veda privately, be it only the syllable Om or the Vyâhritis. Thereby he performs that sacrifice to be offered to Brahman.
2	6	11	7	'The private recitation of the Veda is, indeed, the sacrifice to Brahman. At that sacrifice to Brahman speech, forsooth, (takes the place of) the Guhû, the internal organ (that of) the Upabhrit, the eye (that of) the Dhruvâ, the understanding (that of) the Sruva, truth (that of) the final bath, heaven (is) the conclusion of the sacrifice. He who, knowing this, daily recites the Veda to himself, gains as much heavenly bliss as, and more than, he who gives away this whole earth that is filled with wealth, and imperishable (beatitude), and conquers death. Therefore the Veda should be recited in private. Thus speaks the Brâhmana.'
2	6	11	8	Now they quote also (the following passage): 'If, well anointed, well fed, and lying on a comfortable couch, one recites (the portion of the Veda referring to) any sacrifice, one has offered it thereby.'
2	6	11	9	Some (teachers) declare (that there is a text) which teaches a fourfold division of these sacred duties. (But) as no (other meaning is) perceptible, (the text) 'Four paths,' &c., refers to sacrificial rites.
2	6	11	10	(Viz.) to Ishtis, animal sacrifices, Soma sacrifices, and Darvîhomas.
2	6	11	11	The following (Rik) declares that, 'Four paths, leading to the world of. the gods, go severally from the earth to heaven. All ye gods, place us on that among them which will gain us undecaying prosperity.'
2	6	11	12	The student, the householder, the hermit in the woods, the ascetic (constitute the four orders).
2	6	11	13	A student (shall) obey his teacher until death.
2	6	11	14	A hermit is he who regulates his conduct entirely according to the Institutes proclaimed by Vikhanas.
2	6	11	15	A Vaikhânasa (shall live) in the forest, subsisting on roots and fruit, practising austerities and bathing at morn, noon, and eve; he shall kindle a fire according to the Srâmanaka (rule); he shall eat wild-growing (vegetables and grain) only; he shall worship gods, manes, Bhûtas, men, and Rishis; he shall receive hospitably (men of) all (castes) except those (with whom intercourse is) forbidden; he may even use the flesh of animals killed by carnivorous beasts; he shall not step on ploughed (land); and he shall not enter a village; he shall wear his hair in braids, and dress in (garments made of) bark or skins; he shall not eat anything that has been hoarded for more than a year.
2	6	11	16	An ascetic shall leave his relatives and, not attended by any one nor procuring any property, depart (from his house performing the customary ceremony) according to the rule.
2	6	11	17	He shall go into the forest (and live there).
2	6	11	18	He shall shave his hair excepting the top-lock.
2	6	11	19	He shall wear a cloth to cover his nakedness.
2	6	11	20	He shall reside in one place during the rainy season.
2	6	11	21	He shall wear a dress dyed yellowish-red.
2	6	11	22	He shall go to beg when the pestle lies motionless, when the embers have been extinguished, and when the cleaning of the dishes has been finished.
2	6	11	23	With the three means of punishment, (viz.) words, thoughts, and acts, he shall not injure created beings.
2	6	11	24	He shall carry a cloth for straining water for the sake of purification.
2	6	11	25	He shall perform the necessary purifications with water which has been taken out (of a well or tank) and has been strained.
2	6	11	26	(Ascetics shall) say, 'Renouncing the works taught in the Veda, cut off from both (worlds), we attach ourselves to the central sphere (Brahman).'
2	6	11	27	But the venerable teacher (declares) that there is one order only, because the others do not beget offspring.
2	6	11	28	With reference to this matter they quote also (the following passage): 'There was, forsooth, an Âsura, Kapila by name, the son of Prahlâda.Striving with the gods, he made these divisions. A wise man should not take heed of them.'
2	6	11	29	Because no (other meaning is) perceptible, (the text) 'Four paths,' &c., refers to sacrificial rites, (viz.) to Ishtis, animal sacrifices, Soma sacrifices, Darvîhomas.
2	6	11	30	With respect to this (question the following verse also) is quoted: 'That eternal greatness of the Brâhmana is neither increased by works, nor diminished. The soul knows the nature of that (greatness); knowing that, he is not stained by evil deeds.'
2	6	11	31	If he says that, (let him reflect on the following verse): 'He who knows not the Veda, does not at death think of that great, all-perceiving soul, through which the sun, resplendent with brilliancy, gives warmth, and the father has a father through the son at his birth from the womb.'
2	6	11	32	(Moreover), 'Those who, being neither true Brâhmanas nor performers of Soma sacrifices, work not for that which is near, nor for that which is far, take hold of the word and with sinful (speech) ignorantly perform the rites.'
2	6	11	33	There are innumerable (passages in the Veda) which refer to the debts (to be paid by a Brâhmana), such as, 'May I obtain, O Agni, immortality through offspring;' 'A Brâhmana on being born, (owes) a son to his ancestors,' &c.
2	6	11	34	'Those dwell with us, who fulfil the following (duties), the study of the three Vedas, the studentship, the procreation of offspring, faith, austerity, sacrificing, and giving gifts; he who praises other (duties) becomes dust and perishes.'
2	7	12	1	Now we will explain the oblations (offered) to the vital air (prâna) by Sâlînas (householders) and Yâyâvaras (vagrants), who sacrifice to the soul.
2	7	12	2	At the end of all the necessary (daily rites), let him sit down, facing the east, in a place that has been well cleaned and smeared with cowdung; next let him worship that prepared (food) which is being brought. (saying), 'Bhûh, Bhuvah, Svah, Om,' (and then) remain silent.
2	7	12	3	(Next) he pours water round the food which has been placed (before him), turning his right hand towards it, and reciting the Mahâvyâhritis; (afterwards), continuing to hold (the dish) with his left hand, he first drinks water, (saying), 'Thou art a substratum for ambrosia,' and (finally) offers five oblations of food to the vital airs, (reciting the texts), 'Full of reverence, I offer ambrosia to Prâna; mayest thou propitiously enter me, not in order to burn me. To Prâna, Svâhâ!' &c.
2	7	12	4	After offering the five oblations of food to the vital airs, let him finish his meal silently. Meditating in his heart on the lord of created beings, let him not emit speech while (eating),
2	7	12	5	If he emits speech, he shall mutter 'Bhûh, Bhuvah, Svah, Om,' and afterwards continue to eat.
2	7	12	6	Now they quote also (the following rule): 'If he sees (bits of) skin, hair, nail-(parings), insects, or the dung of rats (in his food), 'he shall take out a lump, sprinkle that spot with water, scatter ashes on it, again sprinkle it with water, and use (the remainder of the food), after it has been declared fit (for use).'
2	7	12	7	Now they quote also (the following verse): 'He shall eat, seated with his face towards the east, silent, not despising his food, not scattering (fragments on the ground), and solely attend (to his dinner); and, after he has eaten, he shall touch fire.'
2	7	12	8	He shall not cut off with his teeth (pieces from) eatables (that must be swallowed) entire, (such as) cakes, bulbs, roots, fruit, and flesh.
2	7	12	9	(Let him) not (eat) to repletion.
2	7	12	10	After (dinner) he shall drink water, (reciting the text), 'Thou art 'a covering for ambrosia,' and stroke (the region of) the heart, (saying), 'Thou art the bond that connects the vital airs; (thou art) [paragraph continues] Rudra and Death; enter me; mayest thou grow through this food.'
2	7	12	11	After sipping water a second time, he allows (the drops from) the hand to flow on the big toe of his right foot (and recites the following text): 'May the male be pleased, he who is of the size of a thumb, who occupies (a space of the size of) a thumb, who is the lord of the whole world, masterful, and the enjoyer of the universe.'
2	7	12	12	Let him perform the subsequent consecration (anumantrana) of the (food which has been) offered, with raised arms, (and let him recite) the five (texts beginning), 'With faith, worshipping Prâna, (I have) offered ambrosia; mayest thou increase Prâna through this food,'
2	7	12	13	(And let him address the soul with the last text of the Anuvâka), '(May) my soul (gain) immortality in the universal soul.'
2	7	12	14	And let him (meditate on his) soul (as) united with the imperishable (syllable Om).
2	7	12	15	He who sacrifices to the soul, surpasses him who offers all sacrifices.
2	7	13	1	Now they quote also (the following verse): 'As cotton and reeds, thrown into a fire, blaze up, even so all the guilt of him who sacrifices to the soul is consumed;'
2	7	13	2	(Moreover), 'He who eats merely (in order to satisfy his own hunger) reaps only guilt. In vain (the fool) takes food.'
2	7	13	3	Let him daily, both in the morning and in the evening, sacrifice in this manner;
2	7	13	4	, Or (he may offer) water in the evening.
2	7	13	5	Now they quote also (the following verses): Let him first feed his guests, next the pregnant women, then the infants and the aged, thereafter the distressed and particularly the diseased. But he who eats first, without having given (food) to those (persons) according to the rule, does not know that he is being eaten. He does not eat, (but) he is eaten.'
2	7	13	6	'Let him eat silently what remains, (after he has given their portions) to the manes, the gods, the servants, his parents, and his Gurus; that is declared to be the rule of the sacred law.'
2	7	13	7	Nov they quote also (the following verses): Eight mouthfuls are the meal of an ascetic, sixteen that of a hermit in the woods, thirty-two that of a householder, and an unlimited (quantity) that of a student.'
2	7	13	8	'An Agnihotrin, a draught-ox, and, a student, those three can do their work only if they eat (much); without eating (much) they cannot do it.'
2	7	13	9	'A householder, or a student who practises austerity by fasting, becomes an Avakîrnin through the omission of the sacrifice to the vital airs;'
2	7	13	10	Except when he performs a penance. In the case of a penance that (fasting) is the rule.
2	7	13	11	Now they quote also (the following verses): 'He who never eats between the morning and the evening meals, (obtains the same reward as he who) constantly fasts.'
2	7	13	12	'As in case one obtains no materials (for the sacrifice), one must mutter the sacred texts to be recited at the Agnihotra, offered in the three fires, even so one should mutter the texts to be recited at the Prânâgnihotra, when one is prevented from dining.'
2	7	13	13	'He who acts thus, will become one with Brahman.' Thus spake Pragâpati (the lord of created beings).
2	8	14	1	The offering to the manes secures long life and heaven, is worthy of praise and a rite ensuring prosperity.
2	8	14	2	Persons who sanctify the company are, a Trimadhu, a Trinâkiketa, a Trisuparna, one who keeps five fires, and one who knows the six Aṅgas, one who performs the vow called Siras, one who knows the Gyeshthasâman, (and) a Snâtaka;
2	8	14	3	On failure of these, one who knows the (texts called) Rahasya.
2	8	14	4	The Rik-verses, the Yagus-formulas, and the Sâmans (give) lustre to a funeral offering. Therefore he may feed (on that occasion) even a Sapinda relation who (knows) those (texts).
2	8	14	5	Let him who feeds (Brâhmanas at a funeral sacrifice) cause them to hear successively the Rakshoghna Sâmans, the Yagus-formulas (called) Svadhâvat, the Rik-verses (called) Madhu, and the (texts called) Pavitras.
2	8	14	6	Having invited on the day before (the Srâddha), or just in the morning, virtuous, pure (men), such as Trimadhus, who know the Vedâṅgas and the sacred texts, who are not related by marriage, nor members of the same family, nor connected through the Veda, at least three, (but always) an odd number, the (sacrificer) makes them sit down on prepared seats, covered with Darbha grass, facing the east or the north.
2	8	14	7	Then he offers to them water mixed with sesamum seed, adorns them with scents and garlands (and says), 'I wish to offer oblations in the fire.' [paragraph continues] When he has received permission (to do so), he heaps fuel on the sacred fire, scatters Kusa grass around it, performs (all the ceremonies) up to the end of the Agnimukha, and offers three burnt oblations of food only, (reciting the following texts): 'To Soma, accompanied by the manes, Svâhâ!' 'To Yama, accompanied by the Aṅgiras and by the manes, Svâhâ!' 'To Agni, who carries the offerings to the manes, who causes sacrifices to be well performed, Svâhâ!'
2	8	14	8	He shall make these three oblations with food only which has been sprinkled with the remainder of the (clarified butter).
2	8	14	9	Let him give a cake of food to the birds.
2	8	14	10	For it is declared in the Veda, 'The manes roam about in the shape of birds.'
2	8	14	11	Next he touches the (other food) with his hand and with the thumb,
2	8	14	12	(And recites the following texts): 'Fire sees thee, who art co-extensive with the earth, the Rik-verses are thy greatness, lest the gift be in vain; the earth is the vessel for thee, the sky the cover; I offer thee in the mouth of Brahman, I offer thee in the Prâna and the Apâna of learned Brâhmanas; thou art imperishable, mayest thou never fail to (the manes of our) fathers yonder, in the other world.' 'Air hears thee, who art co-extensive with the middle sphere, the Yagus-formulas are thy greatness, lest the gift be in vain; the earth is the vessel for thee, the sky the cover; . . . mayest thou never fail to the (manes of our) grandfathers yonder, in the other world.' 'The sun reveals thee, who art co-extensive with the sky, the Sâmans are thy greatness, lest the gift be in vain; . . . . mayest thou never fail to the (manes of our) great-grandfathers yonder, in the other world.'
2	8	15	1	Now indeed (that) happens (also which the following verses teach):
2	8	15	2	'Let him sprinkle that food with the remainder of the burnt oblations. But what is given without (touching it with) the thumb does not gladden the manes.'
2	8	15	3	'The malevolent Asuras seek an opportunity (to snatch away) that food intended for the manes, which is not supported with both hands.'
2	8	15	4	'The Yâtudhânas and Pisâkas, who receive no share, steal the food if sesamum grains are not scattered (on the seats of the guests), and the Asuras (take it) if (the host) is under the sway of anger.'
2	8	15	5	'If a person dressed in reddish clothes mutters prayers, offers burnt oblations, or receives gifts, the sacrificial viands, offered at sacrifices to the gods or to the manes, do not reach the deities.'
2	8	15	6	'If gifts are given or received without (touching them with) the thumb and, if one sips water standing, (the performer of the act) is not benefited thereby.'
2	8	15	7	At the beginning and at the end (of a Srâddha) water must be giver. (to the guests).
2	8	15	8	In every case the muttering (of sacred texts) and the other (necessary acts must be performed) according to the rule.
2	8	15	9	The remaining (rules) have been prescribed (in the section) on the burnt oblations on Ashtakâ (days).
2	8	15	10	'He shall feed two (Brâhmanas) at the offering to the gods and three at the offering to the manes, or a single man on either occasion. Even a very wealthy man shall not be anxious (to entertain) a large company.'
2	8	15	11	'A large company destroys these five (advantages), the respectful treatment (of the invited guests, the propriety of) time and place, purity and (the selection of) virtuous Brâhmana (guests); therefore he shall not invite (a large number).'
2	8	15	12	'In front (feed) the fathers of the (sacrificer), to the left the grandfathers, to the right the great-grandfathers, and at the back those who pare off (portions) from the cakes.'
2	9	16	1	(Now follows some) advice for him who is desirous of offspring.
2	9	16	2	The two Asvins have declared, that fame is gained by the procreation (of sons);
2	9	16	3	'Performing acts which tend to prolong life and austerities, intent on the performance of the private recitation and of sacrifices, and keeping his organs in subjection, let him carefully beget offspring in his own caste.'
2	9	16	4	'From his birth a Brâhmana is loaded with three debts; these let him pay. A prudent man is free from doubts regarding the sacred law.'
2	9	16	5	'If he worships the sages through the study of the Veda, Indra with Soma sacrifices, and the manes of his ancestors through (the procreation of) children, he will rejoice in heaven, free from debt.'
2	9	16	6	'Through a son he conquers the worlds, through a grandson he obtains immortality, but through his son's grandson he ascends to the (highest) heaven.' (All that) has been declared in the Veda.
2	9	16	7	The Veda shows the existence of the three debts in the following (passage): 'A Brâhmana is born loaded with three debts; (he owes) the studentship to the sages, sacrifices to the gods, and a son to the manes;'
2	9	16	8	Through the procreation of a virtuous son he saves himself.
2	9	16	9	He who obtains a virtuous son saves from the fear of sin seven in the descending line and seven in the ascending line, (viz.) six others (in each), himself being the seventh.
2	9	16	10	Therefore he obtains a reward if he begets issue.
2	9	16	11	Therefore he should sedulously beget offspring,
2	9	16	12	Through the application of medicines and sacred texts.
2	9	16	13	The advice to him (who is intent on the procreation of children) is given in agreement with the revealed texts.
2	9	16	14	For it produces results in the case of all the castes.
2	10	17	1	Now we will explain the rule for entering the order of ascetics (samnyâsa).
2	10	17	2	Some (teachers say), 'He who has finished his studentship may become an ascetic immediately on (the completion of) that.'
2	10	17	3	But (according to others, asceticism is befitting) for Sâlînas and Yâyâvaras who are childless;
2	10	17	4	Or a widower (may become an ascetic).
2	10	17	5	(In general) they prescribe the profession of asceticism after the completion of the seventieth year and after the children have been firmly settled in (the performance of) their sacred duties.
2	10	17	6	Or a hermit in the woods (may become an ascetic) on finishing the (special) ceremonies (prescribed for him).
2	10	17	7	'That eternal greatness of the Brâhmana is neither increased nor diminished by works. The soul knows the nature of that (greatness). He who knows that, is not stained by evil deeds.'
2	10	17	8	'It leads to the cessation of births.'
2	10	17	9	'The eternal one leads (him) to glory.' The greatness (of asceticism is declared by these passages).
2	10	17	10	After having caused the hair of his head, his beard, the hair on his body, and his nails to be cut, he prepares
2	10	17	11	Sticks, a rope, a cloth for straining water, a water vessel, and an alms-bowl.
2	10	17	12	Taking these (implements, let him go) to the extremity of the village, or to- the extremity of the boundary (of the village), or to the house where the sacred fires are kept, partake of a threefold (mixture of) clarified butter, milk, (and) sour milk, and (afterwards) fast;
2	10	17	13	Or (he may partake of) water.
2	10	17	14	(Saying), 'Om, Bhûh, I enter the Sâvitrî, tat savitur varenyam; Om, Bhuvah, I enter the Sâvitrî, bhargo devasya dhîmahi; Om, I enter the Sâvitrî, dhiyo yo nah pr.akodayât;' (he shall recite the Sâvitrî) foot by foot, half-verse by half-verse, (and finish by repeating) the whole or the parts (of the verse).
2	10	17	15	It is declared in the Veda, 'Entering order after order, (man) becomes (one with) Brahman.'
2	10	17	16	Now they quote also (the following verse) 'He who has passed from order to order, has offered burnt oblations and kept his organs in subjection, becomes afterwards, tired with (giving) alms and (making) offerings, an ascetic.'
2	10	17	17	Such an ascetic (becomes one with) the infinite (Brahman).
2	10	17	18	Before the sun sets, he heaps fuel on the Gârhapatya fire, brings the Anvâhâryapakana fire (to the spot), takes the flaming Âhavanîya. fire out (of the Gârhapatya), melts butter on the Gârhapatya fire, cleanses it (with Kusa grass), takes four times (portions of it) in the sacrificial spoon (called Sruk), and offers in the Âhavanîya fire on which sacred fuel has been heaped, (four times) a full oblation, (saying), 'Om, Svâhâ!'
2	10	17	19	It is declared in the Veda that this (offering is) the Brahmânvâdhâna (putting fuel on the sacred fires for the sake of the universal soul).
2	10	17	20	Now in the evening, after the Agnihotra has been offered, he scatters grass to the north of the Gârhapatya fire, places the sacrificial vessels in pairs, the upper part turned downwards, on it, strews Darbha grass to the south of the Âhavanîya fire on the seat destined for the Brahman priest, coversit with the skin of a black antelope, and remains awake during that night.
2	10	17	21	A Brâhmana who, knowing this, dies after fasting during the night of Brahman and repositing within himself the sacred fires, conquers all guilt, even (that of) killing a Brâhmana.
2	10	17	22	Then he rises in the muhûrta sacred to Brahman, and offers the early Agnihotra just at the (appointed) time.
2	10	17	23	Next, after covering the (part of the altar called) Prishthyâ and bringing water, he prepares (an offering) to (Agni) Vaisvânara (which is cooked) in twelve potsherds. That (well-)known Ishti is the last (which he performs).
2	10	17	24	Afterwards he throws the sacrificial vessels, which are neither made of earth nor of stone, into the Âhavanîya fire,
2	10	17	25	(And) throwing the two Aranis into the Gârhapatya fire (with the words), 'May ye be of one mind with us,' he reposits the sacred fires in himself.
2	10	17	26	(Reciting the sacred text), 'O Fire, that body of thine, which is fit for the sacrifice,' he inhales the smell of (the smoke of) each fire thrice three times.
2	10	17	27	Then, standing within the sacrificial enclosure, (he says) thrice in a low voice and thrice aloud, 'Om, Bhûh, Bhuvah, Svah, I have entered the order of ascetics, I have entered the order of ascetics, I have entered the order of ascetics,'
2	10	17	28	It is declared in the Veda, 'The gods are trebly true.'
2	10	17	29	(Finally) he pours out as much water as will fill his joined hands, (saying), 'I promise not to injure any living being.'
2	10	17	30	Now they quote also (the following verse) An ascetic who roams about after having given a promise of safety to all living beings, is not threatened with danger by any creature.'
2	10	17	31	(Henceforth) he must restrain his speech.
2	10	17	32	He grasps his staff, (saying), '(Thou art my) friend, protect me.'
2	10	17	33	He takes the rope, (reciting the verse), 'The brilliant light,' &c.
2	10	17	34	He takes the cloth for straining water, (reciting the text), 'With which means of purification the gods,' &c.
2	10	17	35	He takes the waterpot, (reciting the verse), Through that light, by which the gods rose on high,' &c.
2	10	17	36	He takes the alms-bowl, (reciting the Vyâhritis).
2	10	17	37	Taking with him the staves, the rope, the cloth for straining water, the waterpot, (and) the alms-bowl, he goes where water (is to be obtained), bathes, sips water, (and) washes himself, (reciting the verses called) Surabhimatî, Abliṅgâs, Vârunîs, Hiranyavarnâs, and Pâvamânîs. Entering the water, he performs sixteen suppressions of the breath, (mentally repeating) the Aghamarshana hymn, ascends the bank, wrings out his dress, puts on another pure dress, sips water, takes the cloth for straining, (saying), 'Om, Bhûh, Bhuvah, Svah,' and performs the Tarpana (with the following texts), 'Om, Bhûh, I satiate,' 'Om, Bhuvah --, Om, Svah --, Om, Mahah --, Om, Ganah --, Om, Tapah --, Om, Satyam --.'
2	10	17	38	He takes up as much water as his joined hands will hold for the manes, (and satiates them with it) exactly in the same manner as the gods, (saying), 'Om, Bhûh Svadhâ, Om, Bhuvah Svadhâ,' &c.
2	10	17	39	Then he worships the sun, (reciting) the two verses (which begin), 'Ud u tyam kitram,' &c.
2	10	17	40	(Saying), 'Om, this (syllable Om), forsooth, is Brahman; this (syllable) which sheds warmth is light; this which gives warmth is the Veda; this must be known as that which sheds warmth;' he thus satiates the soul (and afterwards) worships the soul (with these texts), 'The soul (is) Brahman, (is) light.'
2	10	17	41	Let him repeat the Sâvitrî one thousand times, or one hundred times, or an unlimited number of times.
2	10	17	42	(Saying), 'Bhûh, Bhuvah, Suvah,' he takes up the cloth for straining, (and) fetches water.
2	10	17	43	Let him not, (at any period) after that (moment), sip water which has not been drawn up (from a well and the like), which has not been strained, and which has not been completely cleansed.
2	10	17	44	Let him not wear any longer a white dress.
2	10	17	45	(He may carry) one staff or three staves.
2	10	18	1	Now the following vows are (to be kept by an ascetic):
2	10	18	2	Abstention from injuring living beings, truthfulness, abstention from appropriating the property of others, continence, (and) liberality.
2	10	18	3	There are five minor vows, (viz.) abstention from anger, obedience towards the Guru, avoidance of rashness, cleanliness and purity in eating.
2	10	18	4	Now (follows the rule for) begging. Let him ask Brâhmanas, both those who have houses (sâlîna) and those who lead a wandering life (yâyâvara), for alms, when the Vaisvadeva offering has been finished.
2	10	18	5	Let him ask (for it), prefacing (his request with the word) Bhavat.
2	10	18	6	Let him stand begging no longer than the time required for milking a cow.
2	10	18	7	When he returns from begging, he lays (the alms) down in a pure place, washes his hands and feet, and announces (what he obtained) to the sun, (reciting the text), 'Ud u tyam kitram,' &c. He (also) announces it to Brahman (with the text), 'The first-born Brahman,' &c.
2	10	18	8	It is declared in the Veda, 'After the Brahmâdhâna the sacrificer himself (contains) the sacrificial fires. His respiration (prâna, represents) the Gârhapatya fire, the air that goes downwards (apâna, represents) the Anvâhâryapakana (or Dakshina) fire, the circulation in the body (vyâna, represents) the Âhavanîya fire, the cerebral circulation (udâna) and the abdominal circulation (samâna, represent) the Sabhya and Âvasathya fires. These five fires are abiding in 'the soul. He (therefore) offers (the oblations) in the soul alone.'
2	10	18	9	'This sacrifice, offered in the soul, which is located in and based on the soul, leads the soul to happiness.'
2	10	18	10	Giving, compassionately, portions (of his food) to the living beings, and sprinkling the remainderwith water, he shall eat it as if it were a medicine.
2	10	18	11	After he has eaten and sipped water, he mutters (the texts), 'Out of darkness we,' &c., (and), My speech resides in the mouth,' &c., and worships the sun with the (verse called) Gyotishmatî.
2	10	18	12	Let him eat food, given without asking, regarding which nothing has been settled before-hand and which has reached him accidentally, so much only as is sufficient to sustain life.
2	10	18	13	Now they quote also (the following verses): 'Eight mouthfuls (make) the meal of an ascetic, sixteen (that) of a hermit in the woods, thirty-two (that) of a householder, an unlimited (quantity that) of a student.'
2	10	18	14	'Alms (may) either (be obtained) from (menof) the three castes, or the food (given) by a single Brâhmana (may be eaten); or (he may obtain food) from (men of) all castes, and not (eat) that given by a single Brâhmana.'
2	10	18	15	Now they quote (the following special rules) for the case that the teachers explain (the doctrine) of the Upanishads: 'Diligently standing (in the day-time), keeping silence, sitting (at night) with crossed legs, bathing three times a day, and eating at the fourth, sixth, or eighth (meal-time only), he shall subsist entirely on (rice) grains, oil-cake, food prepared from barley, sour milk, (and) milk.'
2	10	18	16	It is declared in the Veda, On that (occasion) he shall rigidly keep silence; pressing the teeth together he may converse, without opening his mouth, as much as is necessary with teachers deeply versed in the three Vedas (and) with ascetics possessing a great knowledge of the scriptures, not with women, nor when he would break (his vow).'
2	10	18	17	(Let him keep) only one of (the rules which enjoin) standing (in the day-time), rigid silence, and sitting (at night) with crossed legs; let him not keep all three together.
2	10	18	18	It is declared in the Veda, And he who has gone there may eat, in times of distress, a small quantity of the food prescribed by his vow after (having partaken of other dishes), provided he does not break (his vow).'
2	10	18	19	'Eight (things) do not cause him who is intent on standing (in the day-time), keeping rigid silence, sitting (at night) with crossed legs, bathing three times a day, and (eating) at the fourth, sixth, or eighth meal-time only, to break his vow, (viz.) water, roots, clarified butter, milk, sacrificial food, the wish of a Brâhmana, an order of his teacher, and medicine.'
2	10	18	20	Let him mutter the (Mantras which must berecited at the) Agnihotra, in the evening and in the morning,
2	10	18	21	After performing his evening devotions by (reciting the verses called) Vârunîs, and his morning devotions by (reciting the verses called) Maitrîs.
2	10	18	22	An ascetic shall keep no fire, have no house, no home, and no protector. He may enter a village in order to collect alms, and emit speech at the private recitation of the Veda.'
2	10	18	23	It is declared in the Veda,' Limited in number are the Rik-verses, limited in number are the Sâmans, limited is the answer (of the Adhvaryu priest):
2	10	18	24	'Thus (an ascetic) shall not give up the Veda, (but live), until he is liberated from the body, at the root of the tree.'
2	10	18	25	'The tree (is) the Veda; the syllable Om is its root; the syllable Om is the essence of the Veda.'
2	10	18	26	'Meditating on the syllable Om, he becomesfit (to be united with) Brahman.' Thus spake the lord of created beings.
2	10	18	27	Let him cleanse the vessel of Brahman with the seven Vyâhritis.
3	1	-	1	Now, therefore, (we will speak) of those who desire (to fulfil) the duties of Sâlînas (dwellers in houses), Yâyâvaras (wanderers), and Kakrakaras (circle-goers), who subsist by nine (different) means of livelihood.
3	1	-	2	The term livelihood' (vritti) is used because they subsist thereby (tadvartanât).
3	1	-	3	The word Sâlîna (is used) because they dwell in houses (sâlâ).
3	1	-	4	To be a Yâyâvara (means that one) goes on by means of a most excellent livelihood (vrittyâ varayâ yâti).
3	1	-	5	The term Kakrakara is derived from going by turns (to the houses of rich men).
3	1	-	6	We will explain those (above-mentioned means of livelihood) in their proper order.
3	1	-	7	They are nine, (viz.) Shannivartanî, Kauddâli, Dhruvâ, Samprakshâlanî, Samûhâ, Pâlanî, Siloñkhâ, Kapotâ, and Siddhoñkhâ.
3	1	-	8	(In addition) to these there is a tenth way of living, viz. forest-life.
3	1	-	9	(If he desires to adopt) any of the nine ways of living,
3	1	-	10	He causes the hair of his head, his beard, the hair on his body, and his nails to be cut, and besides gets ready (the following objects),
3	1	-	11	(Viz.) the skin of a black antelope, a water-pot, a staff, a yoke for carrying burdens, (and) a sickle.
3	1	-	12	He desires to go forth, after having offered a Traidhâtavîya (offering) or a Vaisvânarî (ishti).
3	1	-	13	Now on the (following) morning, after the sun has risen, he makes the sacred fires burn brightly, melts butter on the Gârhapatya fire, cleanses it (with Kusa grass), heats the (spoons called) Sruk and Sruva, cleans (them), takes out four (spoonfuls of butter) in the Sruk, and offers the Vâstoshpatîya (oblation) in the Âhavanîya fire according to (the rules of his) Sûtra.
3	1	-	14	Having recited the Puronuvâkyâ (verse), 'O lord of the dwelling, permit us,' &c., he offers (the oblation) with the Yâgyâ verse, 'O lord of the dwelling, with thy kind company,' &c.
3	1	-	15	Some (declare that) every person who has kindled the sacred fires (shall offer these Homas).
3	1	-	16	Others (say that) a Yâyâvara alone (shall do it).
3	1	-	17	After departing (from his house), he stops at the extremity of the village, or at the extremity of the boundary of the village, builds there a hut or a cottage, and enters that.
3	1	-	18	Let him use the skin of the black antelope and the other (objects) which he has prepared for the several purposes which they are intended to serve.
3	1	-	19	Known (is) the (duty of) serving the fires; known (is) the (duty of) offering the new and full moon sacrifices; known (is) the successive performance of the five Mahâyagñas; it is seen that the vegetables, which have been produced, are offered.
3	1	-	20	He hallows those (vegetables), either (reciting the text),' I offer what is agreeable to all the gods,' or silently, and cooks (them).
3	1	-	21	For such (a man the duty of) teaching, sacrificing for others, accepting gifts, and (performing) other sacrifices (than those mentioned) ceases.
3	1	-	22	(The use of) sacrificial food fit to be eaten during the performance of a vow is seen;
3	1	-	23	That is as follows: (his food may be) mixed with clarified butter or sour milk, (it must) not (contain) pungent condiments or salt, nor meat, nor (be) stale.
3	1	-	24	: (He shall remain) chaste, or approach (his wife) in season.
3	1	-	25	(It is necessary) to have the hair of his head, his beard, the hair on his body, and his nails cut on each Parva day, and the rules of purification (are obligatory on him).
3	1	-	26	Now they quote also (the following verses): 'Two kinds of purification, which the Sishtas reverentially practise, are mentioned in the Veda,--external (purification), which consists in the removal of impure stains and foul smells, and internal (purification), which consists in the abstention from injuring live creatures.'
3	1	-	27	'The body is purified by water, the understanding by knowledge, the soul of beings by abstention from injuring, (and) the internal organ by truth.'
3	2	-	1	As regards (the mode of subsistence called) Shannivartanî, (that) is (as follows):
3	2	-	2	He cultivates six Nivartanas (of) fallow (land); he gives a share to the owner (of the soil), or solicits his permission (to keep the whole produce).
3	2	-	3	Let him plough before breakfast with two bulls whose noses have not been pierced, not striking (them) with the goad, (but) frequently coaxing (them).
3	2	-	4	If he cultivates six Nivartanas in this manner (and subsists thereby), that is (the mode of living called) Shannivartanî (subsistence on six Nivartanas).
3	2	-	5	(As regards the mode of subsistence called) Kauddâlî, he digs up (the soil) near a water(-course or tank) with a spade, a ploughshare, or a pointed piece of wood, sows seed, (and) grows bulbs, roots, fruit, pot-herbs, and vegetables.
3	2	-	6	(If he thus) cultivates (land) with a spade (and lives on its produce), that is the (mode of life called) Kauddâlî (subsistence by the spade).
3	2	-	7	He who lives by the (mode of subsistence called) Dhruvâ, wraps up his head in a white dress (saying), 'For the sake of welfare I wrap thee up, O head,' (and) takes the skin of a black antelope (with the words), '(Thou art) spiritual pre-eminence, (I take thee) for the sake of spiritual pre-eminence;' the Pavitra (reciting) the Abliṅga texts; the water-pot (saying), 'Thou art strength, (I take) thee for the sake of strength;' the yoke for carrying burdens (saying), 'Thou art grain, (I take) thee for the sake of prosperity;' the staff (saying), '(Thou art) a friend, protect me.'
3	2	-	8	On leaving (his hut), he mutters the Vyâhritis, and (afterwards the verse used for) hallowing the quarters of the horizon, 'May the earth, the middle sphere, the sky, the constellations, and all the quarters of the horizon, fire, air, and sun, (may all these) deities protect me on my road.'
3	2	-	9	Because, after muttering the Mânastokîya (text) and entering the village, he shows himself with the yoke (on his shoulder) at the door of each house, they call it 'showing oneself.'
3	2	-	10	Because, if every (other) livelihood fails, he persistently (dhruvam) supports himself by this (mode of living), it is called Dhruvâ (the unchangeable).
3	2	-	11	(As regards the mode of life called) Samprakshâlanî, (if, in order to show that) there is no waste of the vegetable (substances) obtained nor any hoarding, he turns the dishes, after washing them, upside down, (that is the livelihood called) Samprakshâlanî (living by washing).
3	2	-	12	As to the (mode of subsistence called) Samûhâ, (if) he sweeps up (grain) with a broom in permitted places where (grain-bearing) plants are found, either on a road or in fields the access to which is not obstructed (by hedges), and lives on (what he has thus obtained), that (livelihood is called) Samûhâ (living by sweeping).
3	2	-	13	As to the (mode of life called) Pâlanî, it is also named Ahimsakâ (not hurting), and the following (definition) is given. (If) he tries to obtain from virtuous men husked rice or seeds, and maintains (himself) thereby, that (is the mode of subsistence called) Pâlanî.
3	2	-	14	As to the (mode of life called) Siloñkhâ, (if) he gleans single ears in permitted places where (grain-bearing) plants grow, on a road or in fields the access to which is not obstructed, and supports himself by (these) gleanings, (collected) from timeto time, that (is the mode of subsistence called) Siloñkhâ (gleaning).
3	2	-	15	As to the (livelihood called) Kapotâ, (if) he picks up with two fingers single grains in permitted places, where (grain-bearing) plants grow, either on the road or in fields the access to which is not obstructed, that (is called), because he acts like a pigeon, Kapotâ (pigeon-life).
3	2	-	16	As to (the mode of life called) Siddhoñkhâ, (if) tired with the (other) ways of subsistence, he asks, because he has become old or diseased, virtuous men for cooked food, that (is the livelihood called) Siddhoñkhâ (gleaning cooked food).
3	2	-	17	If (he adopts) the latter, he must reposit (the sacred fires) in his soul and behave like an ascetic, except (in using) the cloth for straining water and (wearing) a reddish-brown dress.
3	2	-	18	If he subsists on the produce of the forest, (the fruits) of trees, creepers. and lianas, and of grasses, such as wild millet (syâmâka) and wild sesamum, that (is called) forest-life.
3	2	-	19	Now they quote also (the following verse): 'Moving about with the beasts, dwelling together with them, and maintaining oneself in a manner similar to theirs, that is clearly the road to heaven.'
3	3	-	1	Now the hermits in the wood belong to two classes,
3	3	-	2	Those who cook (their food), and those who do not cook it.
3	3	-	3	Among them, those who cook (their food are divided) into five subdivisions, (viz.) those who eat everything which the forest contains, those who live on unhusked (wild-growing grain), those who eat bulbs and roots, those who eat fruit, and those who eat pot-herbs.
3	3	-	4	Those who eat everything which the forest produces are, again, of two kinds: they either subsist on forest-produce generated by Indra, or on that which has been generated from semen.
3	3	-	5	Among these, that which has been generated by Indra (is the produce) of lianas, shrubs, creepers, and trees. Fetching (that) and cooking it, they offer the Agnihotra in the evening and in the morning, give (food) to ascetics, guests, and students, and eat the remainder.
3	3	-	6	That which is generated from semen is the flesh (of animals) slain by tigers, wolves, falcons, and other (carnivorous beasts), or by one of them. Fetching (that) and cooking it, they offer the Agnihotra in the evening and in the morning, give (shares) to ascetics, guests, and students, and eat the remainder.
3	3	-	7	Those who eat unhusked grain only, fetch rice, avoiding (husked) corn, boil it, offer the Agnihotra both in the evening and in the morning, give (food) to ascetics, guests, and students, and eat the remainder.
3	3	-	8	Those who eat bulbs and roots, or fruit, or pot-herbs, (act) exactly in the same manner.
3	3	-	9	Those (hermits) who do not cook (their food are divided into) five (classes), Unmaggakas, Pravrittâsins,[paragraph continues] Mukhenâdâyins, Toyâhâras, and Vâyubhakshas.
3	3	-	10	Among these, the Unmaggakas (collect and prepare their food), avoiding (the use of) iron and stone implements,
3	3	-	11	The Pravrittâsins take it with the hand,
3	3	-	12	The Mukhenâdâyins take it with the mouth (only, like beasts),
3	3	-	13	The Toyâhâras subsist on water only,
3	3	-	14	And the Vâyubhakshas (air-eaters) eat nothing.
3	3	-	15	In this manner ten (different) initiations are prescribed for hermits who follow the rule of Vikhanas (vaikhânasa).
3	3	-	16	He who has agreed (to obey) the Institutes of his (order, shall wear) a staff, (shall keep) rigid silence, and (shall) abstain from rash acts.
3	3	-	17	Hermits following the rule of Vikhanas (vaikhânasa) are purified (from sin), and (especially) those who abstain from food.
3	3	-	18	The sum of the rules applicable to all Brahma-Vaikhânasas (is as follows):
3	3	-	19	'Let him not injure (even) gadflies or gnats; let him bear cold and perform austerities; let him constantly reside in the forest, be contented, anddelight in (dresses made of) bark and skins, (and in carrying) water (in his pot).'
3	3	-	20	'A devotee shall first honour the guests who have come to his hermitage at (dinner) time; he shall be sedulous in (worshipping) gods and Brâhmanas, in (offering) the Agnihotra, and in practising austerities.'
3	3	-	21	"A Brâhmana who has taken to forest-life, and who has adopted this difficult (but) pure mode of existence, which keeps him apart from wicked men, which must never be given up, which is similar to (that of the) beasts and birds, which allows the collection of the necessaries of life for one day only, and which necessitates the consumption of astringent and bitter (food), never sinks low.'
3	3	-	22	'Moving about with the beasts, dwelling together with them, and maintaining oneself in a manner similar to theirs, that is clearly the road to heaven.'
3	4	-	1	Now if a student commits any act against his vow, eats meat, or approaches a woman, whenever any evil befals him,
3	4	-	2	He heaps fuel on the fire in the interior of the house, scatters (Kusa grass) around it, and performs the ceremonies up to the end of the Agnimukha; then he offers oblations of clarified butter, (reciting the following texts): 'It was done by lust, lust doesit, to lust (belongs) all this, to him who draws me on, Svâhâ;' 'It was done by the internal organ, the internal organ does it, to the internal organ (belongs) all this, to him who draws me on, Svâhâ;' 'It was done by passion, passion does it, to passion (belongs) all this, to him who draws me on, Svâhâ;' 'It was done by ignorance, ignorance does it, to ignorance (belongs) all this, to him who draws me on, Svâhâ;' 'It was done by sin, sin does it, to sin (belongs) all this, to him who draws me on, Svâhâ;' 'It was done by wrath, wrath does it, to wrath (belongs) all this, to him who draws me on, Svâhâ.'
3	4	-	3	That which begins with the muttering (of the Vedic texts) and ends with the gift of a fee (consisting of) a cow is known,
3	4	-	4	(Afterwards) he stays (during the night) behind (i. e. to the west of) the fire, wrapping himself in the skin of a black antelope, the neck of which is turned towards the east and the hair of which is turned outside.
3	4	-	5	When the day dawns, he drags himself away from the hinder part (of the skin), goes to a bathing-place, bathes (there) in the manner which is known, (but) performs, while in the water, sixteen suppressions of breath with the Aghamarshana hymn; next he performs the known (ceremonies) up to the worship of the sun, and afterwards goes to the house of his teacher.
3	4	-	6	Let him know for certain that that is equally (effective) as bathing (with the priests) at the end of a horse-sacrifice.
3	5	-	1	Now we will explain the rule of the most holy Aghamarshana.
3	5	-	2	He goes to a bathing-place and bathes (there). Dressed in a pure dress let him raise, close to the water, an altar, and moistening his clothes by one (application of water), and filling his hand once (with water), let him recite the Aghamarshana hymn (in the manner of his daily) private recitation.
3	5	-	3	(Let him repeat it) one hundred times in the morning, one hundred times at midday, and one hundred times or an unlimited number of times in the afternoon.
3	5	-	4	When the stars have risen, let him partake of gruel prepared of one handful of barley.
3	5	-	5	After seven (days and) nights he is freed from all minor sins (upapâtaka), whether they have been committed intentionally or unintentionally, after twelve (days and) nights (from all other sins) excepting the murder of a learned Brâhmana, the violation of a Guru's bed, stealing gold, and drinking Surâ.
3	5	-	6	After twenty-one (days and) nights he over-comes even those (crimes) and conquers them.
3	5	-	7	He overcomes everything, he conquers all, he obtains the reward of all sacrifices, he has bathed at all sacred bathing-places, he has performed the vows required for (the study of) all the Vedas, he becomes known to all the gods, he sanctifies a company (of Brâhmanas) by merely looking (at them), and his undertakings are successful. Thus speaks Baudhâyana.
3	6	-	1	Now if a man feels his conscience charged with (evil) actions committed by himself, let him boil for himself (alone), when the stars have risen, a handful of barley, (and prepare) gruel (with that).
3	6	-	2	Let him not perform the Vaisvadeva oblation with (a portion of) that,
3	6	-	3	Nor (shall) a Bali offering (be performed) on that (occasion).
3	6	-	4	Let him consecrate the barley before it is boiled, while it is being boiled, and after it has been boiled, with the (following) Mantras
3	6	-	5	'Thou art barley, thou art the king of grains, thou art sacred to Varuna and mixed with honey, the sages have proclaimed thee an expeller of all guilt and a means of purification.' 'Ye barley-grains are clarified butter and honey, ye barley-grains are water and ambrosia. May you remove my guilt and all my sins:''Those committed by words, by acts, and by evil thoughts; ill-fortune and the night of all-destroying time,--all that avert from me, ye barley-grains.''(From the sin of eating) food which had been worried by dogs or pigs, or which had been defiled by crows and impure men, from the sin of disobedience towards mother and father,--from all that purify me, ye barley-grains.''From the dreadful (guilt of) mortal sins and of the crime (of serving) a king, from the wrong done to infants or aged men, from (the guilt) of stealing gold, of breaking my vows, of sacrificing for an un-worthy man, of speaking evil of Brâhmanas,--from all that purify me, ye barley-grains.''From (the sin of eating) the food of many men, of harlots and of Sûdras, of (partaking of) funeral dinners and of (the food given by) persons who are unclean on account of a death or a birth, of that given by thieves, or at a funeral sacrifice offered to one who lately died,--from all that purify me, ye barley-grains.'
3	6	-	6	(While the barley) is being boiled, he must protect it (and recite the text), 'Adoration to Rudra, the lord of created beings; pacified is the sky;' the Anuvâka (beginning), 'Give strength;' the five sentences (beginning), 'The gods who are seated in front, led by Agni;' the two (texts), 'Do not hurt our offspring,' (and) 'The Brahman-priest among the gods.'
3	6	-	7	Having purified himself (by sipping water, &c.), he shall eat a little of the boiled (mess), after pouring it into (another) vessel.
3	6	-	8	Let him offer it as a sacrifice to the soul, (reciting the text), 'May the gods, who are born from the internal organ and joined to the internal organ, who are very strong, whose father is Daksha, protect us (and) guard us; adoration to them, to them Svâhâ.'
3	6	-	9	Let him who desires intelligence (subsist on such food during three (days and) nights.
3	6	-	10	A sinner who drinks it during six (days and) nights becomes pure.
3	6	-	11	He who drinks it during seven (days and) nights is purified from (the guilt of) the murder of a learned Brâhmana, of violating a Guru's bed, of stealing gold, and of drinking Surâ.
3	6	-	12	He who drinks it during eleven (days and) nights, removes even the sins committed by his ancestors.
3	6	-	13	'But he who during twenty-one days (drinks gruel made) of barley-grains which have passed through a cow, sees the Ganas and the lord of the Ganas, sees the goddess of learning and the lord of learning.' Thus speaks the venerable Baudhâyana.
3	7	-	1	'Let him who considers himself impure offer (burnt oblations), reciting the Kûshmândas.'
3	7	-	2	, 'He who has had forbidden intercourse, or has committed a crime against nature, becomes even like a thief, even like the slayer of a learned Brâhmana.'
3	7	-	3	'He is freed from any sin which is less than the crime of slaying a learned Brâhmana.'
3	7	-	4	If, after wasting his strength except in his sleep, he desires to become free from the stain and holy,
3	7	-	5	He causes the hair of his head, his beard, the hair on his body, and his nails to be cut on the day of the new moon or of the full moon, and takes upon himself a vow according to the rule prescribed for students,
3	7	-	6	(To be kept) during a year, or a month, or twenty-four days, or twelve nights, or six or three nights.
3	7	-	7	Let him not eat meat, nor approach a woman, not sit on (a couch or seat, and) beware of (speaking an) untruth.
3	7	-	8	To subsist on milk (alone is) the most excellent mode of living; or, using barley-gruel (as his food), he may perform a Krikkhra (penance) of twelve days, or he may (maintain himself by) begging.
3	7	-	9	On such (occasions) a Kshatriya (shall subsist on) barley-gruel, a Vaisya on curds of two-milk whey.
3	7	-	10	Having kindled the sacred fire in the morning according to the rule for Pâkayagñas, having scattered (Kusa grass) around it, and having performed (the preliminary ceremonies) up to the end of the Agnimukha, he next offers in addition burnt oblations, reciting the three Anuvâkas (beginning), 'What cause of anger to the gods, ye gods,' 'The debts which I contracted,' (and) 'May worshipful Agni give thee by every means long life.'
3	7	-	11	Let him offer with each Rik-verse a portion of clarified butter.
3	7	-	12	After having offered four oblations with (the spoon called) Sruva, reciting (the texts), 'That strength which lies in the lion, in the tiger, and in the panther,' &c., and the four Abhyâvartinîs (i.e. the texts), 'Thou, O fire, who turnest back,' &c., 'O Aṅgiras,' &c., 'Again with strength,' &c., (and) 'With wealth,' &c., after having taken his position, with sacred fuel in his hands, in the place allotted to the sacrificer, he worships (the fire) with the hymn which contains twelve verses (and begins), 'To Vaisvânara we announce.'
3	7	-	13	Having placed the piece of sacred fuel (on the fire with the text), 'Whatever sin I ever committed by thoughts or words, from all that free me (O fire, being duly) praised, for thou knowest the truth, Svâhâ,' he gives a fee.
3	7	-	14	(The ceremonies) which begin with the muttering (of the texts) and end with the gift of a cow as a fee are known.
3	7	-	15	One (person) only (shall) perform the service of the fire.
3	7	-	16	Now (let him offer) at the Agnyâdheya full oblations (pûrnâhuti, with the texts), 'Whatever cause of anger to the gods, ye gods;' 'The debts which I contracted;" May worshipful Agni give thee by every means long life.'
3	7	-	17	Having offered (it), he who is about to perform the Agnihotra, (worships) with the Dasahotri (texts); having offered (it), he who is about to perform the new and full moon sacrifices (worships) with the Katurhotri (texts); having offered (it), he who is about to offer the Kâturmâsya sacrifices (worships) with the Pañkahotri (texts); having offered it, (he worships) at an animal sacrifice with the Shaddhotri (texts), at a Soma-sacrifice with the Saptahotri (texts).
3	7	-	18	And it is declared in the Veda, 'Let him sacrifice (with the Kûshmânda texts) at the beginning of the rites; purified (thereby) he gains the world of the gods.' Thus (speaks) the Brâhmana.
3	8	-	1	Now, therefore, we will explain the rule of the Kândrâyana (lunar penance).
3	8	-	2	Let him fast on the fourteenth day of the bright half of the month.
3	8	-	3	Having had the hair on his head, his beard, the hair on his body, and his nails, or his beard alone, cut, let him enter, dressed, in new clothes and speaking the truth, the place where the sacrificial fire is preserved.
3	8	-	4	There a (common) fire, (which may be) fetched once (only, shall serve) him; or (the fire) must be produced by friction with the Aranis.
3	8	-	5	Let a student, who is a friend (of the performer), be ready at hand to (carry out his) directions;
3	8	-	6	And sacrificial viands (shall be his) food during the performance of the vow.
3	8	-	7	Having heaped fuel on the fire, scattered (Kusa grass) around it, and performed (the ceremonies) up to the end of the Agnimukha, he offers burnt oblations, (cutting off portions) from the cooked food,
3	8	-	8	(The first) to Agni, (the second) to the lunar day whichever it may be, (the third and the fourth) to the lunar mansion together with its guardian deity, the fifth to the moon (with the verse), 'Atrâha gor amanvata,' the sixth to the sky and the earth, the seventh to day and night, the eighth to Rudra, the ninth to the sun, the tenth to Varuna, the eleventh to Indra, and the twelfth to all the gods.
3	8	-	9	Now they mention (the following) other (oblations which are to be offered) to the points of the horizon and to their (guardian) deities, to the wide middle sphere and to its (guardian) deity.
3	8	-	10	Having offered (the oblation) to Agni Svishtakrit (with the verse), 'Ever new,' &c., he then places the remainder of the sacrificial viands into a goblet (kamsa) or a cup (kamasa), pours seasoning, that is fit for sacrifices, over them, and eats fifteen morsels of ordinary size,
3	8	-	11	The first (saying, 'I offer) thee to Prâna,' the second (saying,' I offer) thee to Apâna,' the third (saying, 'I offer) thee to Vyâna,' the fourth (saying, 'I offer) thee to Udâna,' the fifth (saying, 'I offer) thee to Samâna.' If there are only four (mouthfuls, he eats) the first reciting two (texts); if there are three, (he eats) the first two reciting two (texts) with each; if there are two, (he eats) the first reciting two (texts and) the second reciting three texts; (if, there is only) one, (he recites) all (the five texts) together.
3	8	-	12	Having drunk water (with the text), 'Thou art water used for moistening Soma,' &c., he then offers the (following) additional oblations of clarified butter, with the seven Anuvâkas (beginning), 'May my Prâna, Apâna, Vyâna, Udâna, and Samâna be purified;' 'May my voice, mind, eye, ear,' &c.; 'May my head, hands, feet;' 'May my skin;' 'May the sense of hearing, touch;' 'May earth, water;' 'May that which consists of food.'
3	8	-	13	(The ceremonies) beginning with the muttering (of sacred texts) and ending with the gift of a cow as a fee are known.
3	8	-	14	He worships the sun with (three verses) ad--dressed to Sûrya and the moon with (three verses) addressed to Kandramas.
3	8	-	15	When he goes to rest, he mutters (the verse), 'O fire, keep thou good watch,'
3	8	-	16	When he awakes (in the morning, the verse), 'O fire, thou art the protector of vows.'
3	8	-	17	Let him not talk with women and Sûdras addressing them first; let him not look at urine and ordure.
3	8	-	18	If he has seen any impure substance, he mutters (the text), 'Unrestrained (was) the internal organ, wretched my eye; the sun is the most excellent among the lights of heaven; O initiation, mayest thou not forsake me.'
3	8	-	19	On the first day of the latter half (of the month he eats) fourteen mouthfuls.
3	8	-	20	Thus (he takes every day) one (mouthful) less up to the day of the new moon.
3	8	-	21	On the day of the new moon there is not (even) one mouthful (left to take).
3	8	-	22	On the first day of the first half (of the month) one (mouthful may be eaten), on the second two.
3	8	-	23	Thus he daily increases (his meal) by one (mouthful) up to the day of the full moon.
3	8	-	24	On the day of the full moon he offers a Sthâlîpâka  to Agni, to the lunar day whichever it may be, and to the lunar mansions as well as to their (guardian) deities.
3	8	-	25	Having offered a burnt oblation to (the lunar mansion) Abhigit (which stands) before Sronâ, and to its (guardian) deity, he must give a cow to the Brâhmanas.
3	8	-	26	That is the ant-shaped lunar penance; (that which is performed in the) inverted (order is called) the barleycorn-shaped (lunar penance).
3	8	-	27	A sinner who has performed either of these two (penances) becomes free from all mortal sins (pâtaka).
3	8	-	28	They declare that the (Kândrâyana) shall be performed for the sake of the fulfilment of wishes of all kinds.
3	8	-	29	'Thereby man obtains every wish which he may conceive.'
3	8	-	30	'Thereby the sages formerly purified themselves and accomplished their objects. That (rite) procures wealth, spiritual merit, sons, cattle, long life, heavenly bliss, and fame; it secures the fulfilment of all desires.'
3	8	-	31	'He who studies this, becomes the companion of the lunar constellations, of sun and moon, and dwells in their world.'
3	9	-	1	Now, therefore, we will explain the rule of the Anasnatpârâyana (recitation of the whole Veda during a fast).
3	9	-	2	Let him wear a clean garment or a dress made of bark (or grass).
3	9	-	3	Let him desire food, fit for a sacrifice, or water and fruit.
3	9	-	4	Going forth from the village in an easterly or northerly direction, smearing a quadrangular sthandila, 'a bull's hide' in size, with cowdung, sprinkling it, drawing the marks on it, sprinkling it with water, heaping fuel on the fire and scattering (Kusa grass) around it, he offers burnt oblations to the following deities, to Agni Svâhâ, to Pragâpati [paragraph continues] Svâhâ, to Soma Svâhâ, to all the gods Svâhâ, to Svayambhu, to the Rikas, to the Yagus, to the Sâmans, to the Atharvans, to faith, to right knowledge, to wisdom, to fortune, to modesty, to Savitri, to the Sâvitrî (verse), to Sadasaspati, and to Anumati.
3	9	-	5	Having offered (these oblations), he must begin with the beginning of the Veda and continuously recite (it).
3	9	-	6	Let him not interrupt (the recitation) by talking, nor by stopping,
3	9	-	7	Now if he converses in between or stops, let him thrice suppress his breath, and begin just there where he left off.
3	9	-	8	If he has forgotten (a passage), he shall recite for as long a time as he does not recollect it, what (he may know, Rik-verses) for Rik-verses, (Yagus-formulas) for Yagus-formulas, (Sâmans) for Sâmans.
3	9	-	9	He may (also) recite the Brâhmana of that (forgotten passage) or (the passage from the Anukramanî regarding) its metre and its deities.
3	9	-	10	Let him recite the Samhitâ of (his) Veda twelve (times). He thereby removes (faults committed by) studying on forbidden (days, by) angering his teacher, (and through) improper acts. His (knowledge of the) Veda is sanctified, is purified.
3	9	-	11	(If he reads) more than that, a cumulation (of rewards will be the result).
3	9	-	12	If he recites the Samhitâ of the Veda another twelve (times), he gains thereby the world of Usanas.
3	9	-	13	If he recites the Samhitâ of the Veda anothertwelve (times), he gains thereby the world of Brihaspati.
3	9	-	14	If he recites the Samhitâ of the Veda another twelve (times), he gains thereby the world of Pragâpati.
3	9	-	15	If, fasting, he recites the Samhitâ one thou-sand (times), he becomes one with Brahman, resplendent like Brahman (and) Brahman (itself).
3	9	-	16	If he subsists during a year on food obtained by begging, he gains (the power of) supernatural vision.
3	9	-	17	If during six months he subsists on barley-gruel, during four months on water and barley-flour, during two months on fruit, (and) during one month on water, or performs Krikkhra penances of twelve days, he (obtains the power of) suddenly disappearing, and sanctifies seven descendants, seven ancestors, and himself as the fifteenth, and (any) company (of Brâhmanas) which he may enter.
3	9	-	18	They call that the ladder of the gods.
3	9	-	19	By means of that the gods reached their divine station and the sages the position of Rishis.
3	9	-	20	The periods for beginning this sacrifice, forsooth, are three, the time of the morning libation, the time of the midday libation, and the last part of the night, (the Muhûrta) sacred to Brahman.
3	9	-	21	Pragâpati, forsooth, proclaimed this (rite) to the seven Rishis, the seven Rishis to Mahâgagñu, and Mahâgagñu to the Brâhmanas.
3	10	-	1	The law of castes and of orders has been declared.
3	10	-	2	Now, indeed, man (in) this (world is polluted) by a vile action or acts wrongly, (e.g.) sacrifices for men. unworthy to offer a sacrifice, accepts presents from those whose gifts ought not to be accepted, eats the food of those whose food ought not to be eaten, (and) practises what is forbidden.
3	10	-	3	They are in doubt if he shall perform a penance for such (a deed) or if he shall not do it.
3	10	-	4	(They declare that he shall not do it) because the deed does not perish.
3	10	-	5	(The correct opinion is) that he shall perform (a penance).
3	10	-	6	It is declared in the Veda, 'Let him offer a Punastoma; (those who offer it, may) again come to (partake of) the libations of Soma.'
3	10	-	7	He who offers a horse-sacrifice conquers all sin, he effaces the guilt of the murder of a Brâhmana.'
3	10	-	8	Moreover, 'He who is being accused (of a heinous crime) shall perform an Agnishtut sacrifice.'
3	10	-	9	Reciting the Veda, austerity, a sacrifice, fasting, giving gifts are the means for expiating such (a blamable act).
3	10	-	10	The purificatory (texts are), the Upanishads, the initial (verses) of the Vedas, the ends of the Vedas (vedântas), the Samhitâs of all the Vedas, (the Anuvâkas called) Madhu, (the hymn of) Aghamarshana, the Atharvasiras, (the Anuvâkas called the) Rudras, the Purusha hymn, the two Sâmans (called) Râgina and Rauhineya, the Brihat (Sâman) and the Rathantara, the Purushagati (Sâman), the Mahânâmnîs, the Mahâvairâga (Sâman), the Mahâdivâkîrtya (Sâman), any of the Gyeshtha Sâmans, the Bahishpavamâna Sâman, the Kûshmândîs, the Pâvamânîs, and the Sâvitrî.
3	10	-	11	To live on milk alone, as if one were fasting, to eat vegetables only, to eat fruit only, (to live on) gruel prepared of a handful of barley-grains, to eat gold, to eat clarified butter (are the modes of subsistence) which purify.
3	10	-	12	All mountains, all rivers, holy lakes, bathing-places, the dwellings of Rishis, cowpens, (holy) plains and temples of the gods (are) places (which destroy sin)
3	10	-	13	Abstention from injuring living beings, truthfulness, abstention from theft (or unrighteously appropriating anything), bathing in the morning, at noon, and in the evening, obedience towards Gurus, continence, sleeping on the ground, dressing in one garment only, and abstaining from food (are the various kinds of) austerity.
3	10	-	14	Gold, a cow, a dress, a horse, land, sesamum, clarified butter, and food (are) the gifts.
3	10	-	15	A year, six months, four (months), three (months), two (months), one (month), twenty-four days, twelve days, six days, three days, a day and a night, (and) one day are the periods (for penances).
3	10	-	16	These (acts) may be optionally performed if no (particular penance) has been prescribed,
3	10	-	17	(Viz.) for great crimes difficult (penances) and for trivial faults easy ones.
3	10	-	18	The Krikkhra and the Atikrikkhra, as well as the Kândrâyana, are penances for all (offences).
4	1	-	1	We will separately explain the various penances for the several offences, both heavier and lighter ones.
4	1	-	2	Let him prescribe whatever may be befitting for each (case),--heavier (penances) for great (crimes) and easier ones for trivial (faults).
4	1	-	3	Let him perform the penances according to the rule given in the Institutes (of the Sacred Law in cases) where an offence has been committed with the organ or with the feet (and) the arms, through thoughts or speech, through the ear, the skin, the nose or the eye.
4	1	-	4	Or, in (the case of) transgressions committed through the organ of vision, of hearing, of sensation, of smelling, and through thoughts, he also becomes pure by three suppressions of the breath.
4	1	-	5	In case (he commits the offences) of eating the food of a Sûdra or of cohabiting with a Sûdra female, severally, he must perform, during seven days, seven suppressions of the breath on each day.
4	1	-	6	For partaking of food unfit for eating or drinking, and for selling forbidden merchandise, excepting honey, meat, clarified butter, oil, pungent condiments and bad food, and for similar (offences), he must perform, during twelve days, twelve suppressions of the breath on each day.
4	1	-	7	For other transgressions excepting mortal sins (pâtaka), crimes causing loss of caste (patanîya), and the minor faults (called upapâtaka), he must perform, during half a month, twelve suppressions of the breath on each day.
4	1	-	8	For other transgressions excepting mortal sins and crimes causing loss of caste, he must perform, during twelve periods of twelve days, twelve suppressions of the breath on each day.
4	1	-	9	For other transgressions excepting mortal sins he must perform, during twelve half-months, twelve suppressions of the breath on each day.
4	1	-	10	But for mortal sins he must perform, during a year, twelve suppressions of the breath on each day.
4	1	-	11	Let him give his daughter, while she still goes naked, to a man who has not broken the vow of chastity and who possesses good qualities, or even to one destitute of good qualities; let him not keep (the maiden) in (his house) after she has reached the age of puberty.
4	1	-	12	He who does not give away a marriageable daughter during three years doubtlessly contracts a guilt equal to (that of) destroying an embryo.
4	1	-	13	Such will be the case if anybody asks her in marriage, and also if nobody demands her. Manu has declared that at each appearance of the menses (the father incurs the guilt of) a mortal sin.
4	1	-	14	Three years let a marriageable damsel wait for the order of her father. But after (that) time let her choose for herself in the fourth year a husband (of) equal (rank). If no man (of) equal (rank) be found, she may take even one destitute of good qualities.
4	1	-	15	If a damsel has been abducted by force, and has not been wedded with sacred texts, she may lawfully be given to another man; she is even like a maiden.
4	1	-	16	If, after (a damsel) has been given away, or even after (the nuptial sacrifices) have been offered, the husband dies, she who (thus) has left (her father's house) and has returned, may be again wedded according to the rule applicable to second weddings, provided the marriage had not been consummated.
4	1	-	17	He who does not approach, during three years, a wife who is marriageable, incurs, without doubt, a guilt equal to that of destroying an embryo.
4	1	-	18	But the ancestors of that man who does not approach his wife who bathed after her temporary uncleanness, though he dwells near her, lie during that month in the menstrual excretions (of the wife).
4	1	-	19	They declare that the guilt of the husband who does not approach his wife in due season, of him who approaches her during her temporary uncleanness, and of him who commits an unnatural crime (with her), is equally (great).
4	1	-	20	Let him proclaim in the village a wife who, being obdurate against her husband, makes herself sterile, as one who destroys embryos, and drive her from his house.
4	1	-	21	But for the transgression of that husband who does not approach a wife who bathed after temporary uncleanness, (the performance of) one hundred suppressions of the breath is prescribed (as a penance).
4	1	-	22	Seated with Kusa grass in his hands, let him repeatedly suppress his breath, and again and again recite purificatory texts, the Vyâhritis, the syllable Om, and the daily portion of the Veda.
4	1	-	23	Always intent on the practice of Yoga, let him again and again suppress his breath. (Thus) he performs the highest austerity up to the ends of his hair and up to the ends of his nails.
4	1	-	24	Through the obstruction (of the respiration) air is generated, through air fire is produced, then through heat water is formed; hence he is internally purified by (those) three.
4	1	-	25	Through the practice of Yoga (true) knowledge is obtained, Yoga is the sum of the sacred law, all good qualities are gained through Yoga; therefore let him always be absorbed in the practice of Yoga.
4	1	-	26	The Vedas likewise begin with the syllable Om, and they end with the syllable Om. The syllable Om and the Vyâhritis are the eternal, everlasting Brahman.
4	1	-	27	For him who is constantly engaged in (reciting) the syllable Om, the seven Vyâhritis, and the three-footed Gâyatrî, no danger exists anywhere.
4	1	-	28	If, restraining his breath, he thrice recites the Gâyatrî together with the syllable Om and with the (text called) Siras, that is called one suppression of breath.
4	1	-	29	But sixteen suppressions of breath, accompanied by (the recitation of) the Vyâhritis and of the syllable Om, repeated daily, purify after a month even the slayer of a learned Brâhmana.
4	1	-	30	That is the highest austerity, that is the best description of the sacred law. That, indeed, is the best means of removing all sin.
4	2	-	1	We will separately explain the various penances for the several offences, both heavier and lighter ones.
4	2	-	2	Let him prescribe whatever may be befitting for each (case),--heavier penances for great (crimes), and lighter ones for trivial (faults).
4	2	-	3	Let him perform the penances according to the rule given in the Institutes of the Sacred Law.
4	2	-	4	He who is about to accept gifts, or he who has accepted gifts, must repeatedly recite the four Rik-verses (called) Taratsamandîs.
4	2	-	5	But in case one has eaten any kind of forbidden food; or that given by a person whose food must not be eaten, the means of removing the guilt is to sprinkle water (over one's head) while one recites the Taratsamandî Rikas.
4	2	-	6	But we will, hereafter, declare another rule for (the expiation of) the murder of a learned Brâhmana, whereby (men) are freed also from mortal sins of all (kinds).
4	2	-	7	Let him (perform), during twelve nights, suppressionsof the breath (and) mutter purificatory texts, the Vyâhritis, the syllable Om, (and) the Aghamarshana hymn, (living) on milk;
4	2	-	8	Or (he becomes) pure if he bathes, and during three (days and) nights subsists on air and (remains dressed) in wet clothes.
4	2	-	9	But if he has repeatedly committed forbidden acts of all kinds, and has (afterwards) worshipped reciting the Vârunî (texts), he is freed from all sin.
4	2	-	10	Now a student who has broken his vow (avakîrnin) shall heap fuel on the fire on the night of the new moon, perform the preparatory ceremonies required for a Darvîhoma, and offer two oblations of clarified butter (reciting the following texts): 'O Lust, I have broken my vow, my vow I have broken, O Lust, to. Lust Svâhâ;' 'O Lust, I have done evil, I have done evil, O Lust, to Lust Svâhâ.'
4	2	-	11	After he has made the offering, he shall address the fire, closely joining his hands and turning sideways, (with the following texts): 'May the Maruts grant me, may Indra, may Brihaspati,, may this fire grant me long life and strength, make me long-lived.' The Maruts, forsooth, give back to him the vital airs, Indra gives back to him strength, Brihaspati the lustre of Brahman, Fire all the remainder. (Thus) his body is made whole, and he attains the full length of life. Let him next address (the gods) with three (repetitions of the texts).[paragraph continues] For the gods are trebly true. (All that) has been declared in the Veda.
4	2	-	12	He who considers himself defiled by minor offences (upapâtaka), will be freed from all guilt if he offers burnt oblations according to this same rule;
4	2	-	13	Or if he has partaken of food unfit to be eaten or to be drunk or of forbidden food, and if he has committed sinful acts or performed sinful rites either unintentionally or intentionally, and if he has had connexion with a female of the Sûdra caste or committed an unnatural crime, he becomes pure by bathing (and reciting) the Abliṅga (verses) and (those called) Vârunîs.
4	2	-	14	Now they quote also (the following verse): If he has partaken of food unfit to be eaten or to be drunk, or of forbidden food, and if he has committed forbidden acts or performed forbidden rites, he will, nevertheless, be freed from (crimes) committed intentionally which are similar to mortal sins, nay, even from mortal sins (pâtaka).'
4	2	-	15	Or let him fast during three (days and) nights, bathe thrice a day, and, suppressing his breath, thrice recite the Aghamarshana. Manu has declared that that is equal (in efficacy) to the final bath at a horse-sacrifice.
4	2	-	16	And it is declared in the Veda, '(That is) the ancient purificatory rite, which is widely known (in the Institutes of the Sacred Law); purified thereby man conquers sin. May we, sanctified by this holy means of purification, conquer our enemy, sin.'
4	3	-	1	We will explain the (secret) penances which are not prescribed (by others, but by the offender himself, and) particularly what shall be done in (case) faults (have been committed) by men who, with concentrated minds, (are) intent (on the performance of their duties).
4	3	-	2	(Such a man) may sip water, (in order to atone) for all mortal sins, reciting the syllable Om and all the Vyâhritis.
4	3	-	3	When he sips water the first time, he gladdens the Rig-veda, the second time the Yagur-veda, the third time the Sâma-veda.
4	3	-	4	When he wipes (his lips) the first time, he gladdens the Atharva-veda, the second time the Itihâsas and Purânas.
4	3	-	5	When he sprinkles water on the right hand, the feet, the head, the heart, the nostrils, the eyes, the ears, and the navel, he gladdens the trees and herbs and all deities. Therefore he is freed from all sin by sipping water.
4	3	-	6	Or let him offer in the fire eight pieces of sacred fuel, reciting (the following) eight (texts): 'Thou art the expiation of sin committed by the gods, Svâhâ;' 'Thou art the expiation of sin committed by men, Svâhâ;' 'Thou art the expiation of sin committed by the manes, Svâhâ;' 'Thou art the expiation of sin committed by myself, Svâhâ;' 'Thou art the expiation of the sift which we have committed either by day or by night, Svâhâ;" Thou art the expiation of the sin which we have committed either sleeping or waking, Svâhâ;' 'Thou art the expiation of the sin which we have committed either intentionally or unintentionally, Svâhâ;' Thou art the expiation of every sin, Svâhâ.'
4	3	-	7	When he has offered (these eight oblations) he will be freed from all guilt.
4	3	-	8	Now they quote also (the following verse): 'The Aghamarshana, the Devakrita, the Suddhavatîs, the Taratsamâs, the Kûshmândîs, the Pâvamânîs, the Virâgâs, the Mrityulâṅgala, the Durgâ (Sâvitrî), the Vyâhritis, and the Rudras (are texts) which are very efficacious for effacing sin.'
4	4	-	1	We will explain the (secret) penances which are not prescribed (by others, but by the offender himself, and) particularly what shall be done in (case) faults (have been committed) by men who, with concentrated minds, (are) intent (on the performance of their duties).
4	4	-	2	He who, standing in water, thrice recites that (hymn of) Aghamarshana (which begins), 'Both right and truth,' will be freed from all guilt.
4	4	-	3	He who, standing in water, thrice recites the verse, 'This spotted bull,' &c., will be freed from all guilt;
4	4	-	4	He who, standing in water, thrice recites the verse, 'Freed from the post as it were,' will be freed from all guilt.
4	4	-	5	He who, standing in water, thrice recites the verse, 'A swan dwelling in purity,' will be freed from all guilt;
4	4	-	6	Or, he who, standing in water, thrice recites the Sâvitrî, foot by foot, half verse by half verse, and afterwards entire, will be freed from all guilt;
4	4	-	7	Or, he who, standing in water, thrice recites the Vyâhritis, both separately and altogether, will be freed from all guilt;
4	4	-	8	Or, he who, standing in water, thrice recites the syllable Om alone, will be freed from all guilt.
4	4	-	9	Let him not teach these Institutes of the Sacred Law to one who is neither his son nor his pupil, nor has resided (in his house) less than a year.
4	4	-	10	The fee (for teaching it) is one thousand (panas, or) ten cows and a bull, or the worship of the teacher.
4	5	-	1	Now, therefore, I will proclaim by what rites, connected with the Sâman, Rik, Yagus, and Atharva-vedas, [paragraph continues] (man) quickly attains the wishes of his heart.
4	5	-	2	Having purified his body by muttered prayers, burnt oblations, Ishtis, restraints, and the like, he will accomplish all his objects. He will not attain success in any other way.
4	5	-	3	A Brâhmana, who is going to mutter prayers, to offer burnt oblations or Ishtis, or to practise restraints, shall, first, during the bright half of the month, on a lucky day and under a lucky constellation, cause his hair and beard to be cut.
4	5	-	4	Let him bathe in the morning, at noon, and in the evening; let him beware of anger and untruth; let him not address women and Sûdras; let him be continent, and subsist solely on food fit for offerings.
4	5	-	5	Avoiding to sleep in the day-time, let him worship cows, Brâhmanas, manes, and gods. As long as he is engaged in muttering prayers, offering Homas and Ishtis, and practising restraints, let him stand during the day and sit during the night.
4	5	-	6	The Krikkhra (penance) revealed by Pragâpati lasts twelve days, (which are divided into four separate) periods of three days; (during the first period of three days he eats) in the day-time (only, during the second) at night (only, during the third he subsists on) food given without asking, (and during the fourth) finally (he lives on) air.
4	5	-	7	(If one eats on) one (day in) the morning (only), and (on the following day) at night (only, on the next day food) given without asking, (and on the fourth day) subsists on air, and repeats this three times, that is called the Krikkhra (penance) of children.
4	5	-	8	(If) one eats one mouthful only at each (meal), following, during (three) periods of three days, the rules given above, and subsists during another period of three days on air, that is called the Atikrikkhra penance.
4	5	-	9	(If) during those (first) three periods of three days one partakes of water only, and subsists afterwards (during three days) on air, that third (variety) must be known to be the most efficacious Krikkhrâtikrikkhra penance.
4	5	-	10	If one drinks hot milk, (hot) clarified butter, (and a hot) decoction of Kusa grass, each during three days, and fasts during another three days, that is called the Taptakrikkhra.
4	5	-	11	(If one lives during one day) on cow's urine, (during one day) on cowdung, (during one day) on milk, (during one day) on sour milk, (during one day) on clarified butter, (during one day) on a decoction of Kusa grass, and during one (day and) night on air, that is called the Sâmtâpana Krikkhra.
4	5	-	12	Let him take the cow's urine, reciting the Gâyatrî; the cowdung, (reciting the text), 'Gandhadvârâm;' the milk, (reciting the verse), 'Âpyâyasva;' the sour milk, reciting (the verse), 'Dadhikrâvnâ;' the clarified butter, (saying), 'Sukram asi;' the decoction of Kusa grass (with the text), 'Devasya tvâ;'
4	5	-	13	(And mix together) one part of cow's urine, half as much .cowdung, three parts of milk, two of sour milk, one part of clarified butter, and one part of water boiled with Kusa grass;' a Sâmtâpana Krikkhra (performed) in this manner will purify even a Svapâka.
4	5	-	14	He who subsists during five (days and) nights on cow's urine, cowdung, milk, sour milk, and clarified butter will be purified by (that) Pañkagavya (the five products of the cow).
4	5	-	15	If, self-restrained and attentive, he fasts during twelve days, that is called a Parâka Krikkhra, which destroys all sin.
4	5	-	16	If he subsists on cow's urine and the other (substances named above), one day on each, and continues (this mode of life) during thrice seven days, the theologians call that a Mahâsâmtâpana Krikkhra.
4	5	-	17	If he daily adds to his food one mouthful during the bright (half of the month) and diminishes it daily by one mouthful during the dark (half of the month), and keeps two fasts in the two halves of the month, that is called a Kândrâyana.
4	5	-	18	If, with concentrated mind, a Brâhmana eats four mouthfuls in the morning and four mouthfuls when the sun has set, he will perform the Kândrâyana of children.
4	5	-	19	If, self-restrained, he daily eats, during a month, at midday eight mouthfuls of food, fit for a sacrifice, he will perform the Kândrâyana of ascetics.
4	5	-	20	But a Brâhmana who eats anyhow, during a month, thrice eighty mouthfuls of food, fit for a sacrifice, goes to the world of the moon.
4	5	-	21	As the rising moon frees the world from the fear of darkness, even so a Brâhmana who performs a Kândrâyana removes the fear of sin.
4	5	-	22	He who lives one day on (rice)-grains, three days on oil-cakes, 'five days on buttermilk mixed with water, seven days on water, and (one day) on air, (performs) the guilt-destroying Tulâpurusha.
4	5	-	23	Living on barley-gruel (yâvaka) removes the guilt of corporeal beings after seven days, and so does a fast of seven days; that has been recognised by wise men.
4	5	-	24	By dressing in wet clothes, by living in the open air, and by exposing himself to the sun during the light halves of the months Pausha (December-January), Bhâdrapada (August-September), and Gyeshtha (May-June), a Brâhmana is freed from (all) sin excepting crimes causing loss of caste (patanîya).
4	5	-	25	(If one swallows) cows' urine, cowdung, milk, sour milk, clarified butter, and a decoction of Kusa grass, mixed with barley gruel, that is the most sanctifying Brahmakûrka.
4	5	-	26	He who fasts on the new moon day and eats sesamum grains on the full moon day, will be freed in the course of a year from the sins which he committed in the bright and the dark halves of the month.
4	5	-	27	He who lives on alms obtained from Agnihotrins is purified in one month; (he who obtains his food) from a Yâyâvara. in ten days; he who receives it from a hermit in the forest, in five days;
4	5	-	28	(He who lives) on food given by a person who has a store sufficient for one day only, will be purified in one day; he who drinks water given by a person subsisting by the Kapota-vritti (pigeon-life), is purified in three (days).
4	5	-	29	If one recites the whole Rig-veda, Yagur-veda, and Sâma-veda, or thrice reads one of these Vedas and fasts, (that is) a most efficient means of purification.
4	5	-	30	Now if one is in haste to finish, one may live on air during a day, and pass the night standing in water, that is equal (in efficacy) to a Prâgâpatya (Krikkhra).
4	5	-	31	He who at sunrise mutters the Gâyatrî one thousand and eight times, is free from all sin, provided he has not slain a learned Brâhmana.
4	5	-	32	He who distributes food, speaks the truth, and has compassion on all living beings, is more (holy) than all those who have been purified by the restraints mentioned above.
4	6	-	1	The (eleven Anuvâkas called) Rudras together with (the ten hymns) seen by Madhukkhandas, the Gâyatrî with the syllable Om, and likewise the seven Vyâhritis (are the texts) which should be muttered (and) which remove guilt.
4	6	-	2	The Mrigâreshti, the Pavitreshti, the Trihavis, the Pâvamânî are the Ishtis which efface sin, if they are (each) combined with the Vaisvânara (Dvâdasakapâla).
4	6	-	3-4	Learn, also, the following most excellent secret; he will be freed from all sins of all kinds who sprinkles himself with water, reciting the Pavitras, who mutters the eleven (Anuvâkas called) Rudras, who offers burnt oblations of butter, reciting the Pavitras, and gives gold, a cow, and sesamum (to Brâhmanas).
4	6	-	5	He who partakes of boiled barley-gruel, mixed with cow's urine, liquid cowdung, sour milk, milk, and butter, is quickly freed from sin.
4	6	-	6	Both he who has begotten a child on a Sûdra woman and he who has had connexion with a female, intercourse with whom is forbidden (agamyâ), are purified (if they live) according to this rule during seven days.
4	6	-	7	(That is likewise) the remedy when one has swallowed semen, ordure, and urine, or eaten the food of persons whose food must not be eaten, (and also) when a younger brother has kindled the sacred fire, has offered a Srauta sacrifice, or taken a wife before the elder.
4	6	-	8	He who has committed even a great number of (wicked) actions, excepting mortal sins, will be freed (by that rule) from all guilt. That is the statement of the virtuous.
4	6	-	9	But (this) ordinance, which is based on the authority of the sacred texts, is stated (to be that) through which Bharadvâga and others became equal to Brahman,
4	6	-	10	Through the performance of these rites a Brâhmana, whose heart is full of peace, obtains whatever desires he may have in his heart.
4	7	-	1	The wishes of a Brâhmana who has left off evil deeds and is (ever) engaged in holy works are fulfilled even without (the practice of) restraints.
4	7	-	2	Upright Brâhmanas quickly accomplish whateverthey wish in their hearts, if they are purified by honest actions.
4	7	-	3	Thus a wise man should practise those restraints until he has purified his bodily frame.
4	7	-	4	He who has been purified by those restraints should, after fasting three (days and) nights, begin the performance of that sacred rite through which he wishes to gain the fulfilment of his desires,
4	7	-	5	(Reciting) the Kshâpavitra, the Sahasrâksha, the Mrigâra, the two Ganas (called) Amhomuk, the Pâvamanîs, the Kûshmândîs, and the Rikas, addressed to Vaisvânara,
4	7	-	6	(And) offering with (each of) these (Mantras) boiled rice and clarified butter during seven days, in the morning, at midday, and in the evening, keeping a rigid silence, living on food fit for a sacrifice, restraining his senses and his actions,
4	7	-	7	He is freed from all crimes, even mortal sins, after looking on a cross-road at a pot filled with water, (and reciting the text), 'Simhe me manyuh.'
4	7	-	8	He is freed from the multitude of sins, committed unintentionally in old age, in youth, and in infancy, and even from those belonging to former births;
4	7	-	9	After feeding at the end (of the seven days) Brâhmanas with milk and rice, well. mixed withbutter, and distributing to them after their dinner cows, land, sesamum, and gold,
4	7	-	10	A Brâhmana becomes internally pure, his guilt being consumed like fuel, and fit for the performance of rites which secure the fulfilment of wishes and of rites like the kindling of the sacred fire.
4	8	-	1	He who, through excessive greed or carelessness, performs this rite for others, is tainted by sin, and perishes like one who has swallowed poison.
4	8	-	2	A Brâhmana who performs this rite for his teacher, his father, his mother, or for himself is resplendent like the sun. Therefore this rite may be performed for those (persons).
4	8	-	3	Ka (Pragâpati) purified by means of this rite the god with a thousand eyes (Sahasrâksha), Fire, Wind, the Sun, Soma, Yama, and other lords of the gods.
4	8	-	4	Whatever there is in these three worlds, famed as possessing a holy name, Brâhmanas and the rest, (all) that was produced by Ka through this rite of sanctification.
4	8	-	5	This sin-destroying secret of Pragâpati was first produced; thereafter thousands of purificatory rites .came into existence.
4	8	-	6	He who performs those eight Ganahomas on the (first) day of the year, of a half-year, of a season, or of a fortnight, sanctifies ten ancestors and ten descendants of his line;
4	8	-	7	And, while still on earth, he is known to thegods in heaven as a holy man, and (after death) that virtuous man rejoices for a very long time in heaven like a god.
4	8	-	8	If a Brâhmana is unable to offer those eight Ganahomas, let him offer one; thereby his guilt is effaced.
4	8	-	9	He, also, whose sons or pupils offer those eight Ganahomas, is freed from his sin which is bought off by his having instructed (them).
4	8	-	10	Through a desire of removing one's guilt one even may cause (these oblations) to be offered by men who have been engaged for money, in case oneself is unable (to do it); a man need not torment himself.
4	8	-	11	Even among the virtuous a distribution of wealth is made (for the success) of holy rites; some-times a man who is free from debt is (thereby) freed from guilt.
4	8	-	12	, Liberated according to this rule from the ocean of guilt and debt, he considers himself pure and able to successfully perform the sacred rites.
4	8	-	13	But in the case of that pure mortal who, freed from all sin and debts, begins the sacred rites, they will succeed without any effort.
4	8	-	14	Let him daily (study and) teach this holy (rule) of Pragâpati, which the sage has proclaimed, let him remember it or hear it. (By doing that) he is freed from all guilt and will be exalted in Brahman's world.
4	8	-	15	Let him mutter during twelve days those sacred texts through which he wishes to accomplish (his desires), eating once (a day) at night boiled rice with clarified butter, with milk, or with sour milk.
4	8	-	16	(Let him offer) ten times a burnt oblation and sprinkle clarified butter. (That is) the preliminary worship (which must be performed) when one desires to accomplish one's objects through those sacred texts.
