Chapter_no	Text_no	Hymn
1	1	THE night of Brahman being over, and the God sprung from the lotus (Brahman) having woke from his slumber, Vishnu purposing to create living beings, and perceiving the earth covered with water,
1	2	Assumed the shape of a boar, delighting to sport in water, as at the beginning of each former Kalpa, and raised up the earth (from the water).
1	3	His feet were the Vedas; his tusks the sacrificial stakes; in his teeth were the offerings; his mouth was the pyre; his tongue was the fire; his hair was the sacrificial grass; the sacred texts were his head; and he was (endowed with the miraculous power of) a great ascetic.
1	4	His eyes were day and night; he was of superhuman nature; his ears were the two bundles of Kusa grass (for the Ishtis, or smaller sacrifices, and for the animal offerings); his ear-rings were the ends of those bundles of Kusa grass (used for wipingthe ladle and other sacrificial implements); his nose (the vessel containing) the clarified butter; his snout was the ladle of oblations; his voice was similar in sound to the chanting of the Sâma-veda; and he was of huge size.
1	5	He was full of piety and veracity; beautiful; his strides and his strength were immense (like those of Vishnu); his large nostrils were penances; his knees the victim; and his figure colossal.
1	6	His entrails were the (three) chanters of the Sama-veda; his member was the burnt-oblation; his scrotum was the sacrificial seeds and grains; his mind was the altar (in the hut for the wives and domestic uses of the sacrificer); the hindparts (of Vishnu) in his transformation were the Mantras; his blood was the Soma juice.
1	7	His shoulders were the (great) altar; his smell was that of the (sacrificial cake and other) oblations; his speed was the oblations to the gods and to the manes and other oblations; his body was the hut for the wives and domestic uses of the sacrificer; he was majestic; and instructed with the initiatory ceremonies for manifold sacrifices (lasting one, or two, three, or twelve years, and others).
1	8	His heart was the sacrificial fee; he was possessed of the (sacrificial and other) great Mantras employed in order to effect the union of the mind with the Supreme; he was of enormous size (like the long sacrifices lasting more than one day); his lovely, lips were the beginnings of the twohymns recited at the beginning of the animal sacrifice; his ornaments were the whirlpool of the milk poured into the heated vessel (at the Pravargya ceremony introductory to the Soma-sacrifice).
1	9	All sorts of sacred texts (the Gâyatrî and others) were his path in marching; the mysterious Upanishads (the Vedânta) were his couch; he was accompanied by his consort Khâyâ (Lakshmî); he was in size like the Manisringa mountain.
1	10	The lord, the creator, the great Yogin, plunging into the one ocean from love of the world,
1	11	Raised up, with the edge of his tusks, the earth bounded by the sea together with its mountains, forests, and groves, which was immersed in the water of (the seven oceans now become) one ocean, and created the universe anew.
1	12	Thus the whole earth, after having sunk into (the lower region called) Rasâtala, was in the first place raised in the boar-incarnation by Vishnu, who took compassion upon the living beings.
1	13	,
1	14	Then, after having raised the earth, the destroyer of Madhu placed and fixed it upon its own (former) seat (upon the oceans) and distributed the waters upon it according to their own (former) station, conducting the floods of the oceans into the oceans, the water of the rivers into the rivers, the water of the tanks into the tanks, and the water of the lakes into the lakes.
1	15	He created the seven (lower regions called) Pâtâlas and the seven worlds, the seven Dvîpas.
1	16	(He created) the rulers of the (seven) Dvîpas and the (eight) guardians of the world (Indra and the rest), the rivers, mountains, and trees, the seven Rishis, who know (and practise) the law, the Vedas together with their Angas, the Suras, and the Asuras.
1	17	(He created) Pisâkas (ogres), Uragas (serpents), Gandharvas (celestial singers), Yakshas (keepers of Kubera's treasures), Rakshasas (goblins), and men, cattle, birds, deer and other animals, (in short) all the four kinds of living beings, and clouds, rainbows, lightnings, and other celestial phenomena or bodies (such as the planets and the asterisms), and all kinds of sacrifices.
1	18	Bhagavat, after having thus created, in theshape of a boar, this world together with all animate and inanimate things in it, went away into a place hidden from the world.
1	19	Ganârdana, the chief of the gods, having become invisible, the goddess of the earth began to consider, 'How shall I be able to sustain myself (henceforth)?'
1	20	'I will go to Kasyapa to ask: he will tell me the truth. The great Muni has my welfare under constant consideration.'
1	21	Having thus decided upon her course, the goddess, assuming the shape of a woman, went to see Kasyapa, and Kasyapa saw her.
1	22	Her eyes were similar, to the leaves of the blue lotus (of which the bow of Kâma, the god of love, is made); her face was radiant like the moon in the autumn season; her locks were as dark as a swarm of black bees; she was radiant; her lip was (red) like the Bandhugîva flower; and she was lovely to behold.
1	23	Her eyebrows were fine; her teeth exceedingly small; her nose handsome; her brows bent; her neck shaped like a shell; her thighs were constantly touching each other; and they were fleshy thighs, which adorned her loins.
1	24	Her breasts were shining white, firm, plump, very close to each other, (decorated with continuous strings of pearls) like the projections on the forehead of Indra's elephant, and radiant like the gold (of the two golden jars used at the consecration of a king).
1	25	Her arms were as delicate as lotus fibres; her hands were similar to young shoots; her thighs were resplendent like golden pillars; and her knees were hidden (under the flesh), and closely touching each other.
1	26	Her legs were smooth and exquisitely proportioned; her feet exceedingly graceful; her loins fleshy; and her waist like that of a lion's cub.
1	27	Her reddish nails shone (like rubies); her beauty was the delight of every looker-on; and with her glances she filled at every step all the quarters of the sky as it were with lotus-flowers.
1	28	Radiant with divine lustre, she illuminated all the quarters of the sky with it; her clothing was most exquisite and perfectly white; and she was decorated with the most precious gems.
1	29	With her steps she covered the earth as it were with lotuses; she was endowed with beauty and youthful charms; and made her approach with modest bearing.
1	30	Having seen her come near, Kasyapa saluted her reverentially, and said, 'O handsome lady, O earth, radiant with divine lustre, I am acquainted with thy thoughts.
1	31	'Go to visit Ganârdana, O large-eyed lady; he will tell thee accurately, how thou shalt henceforth sustain thyself.
1	32	For thy sake, O (goddess), whose face is lovely and whose limbs are beautiful, I have found out, by profound meditation, that his residence is in the Kshîroda (milk-ocean).'
1	33	The goddess of the earth answered, 'Yes, (I shall do as you bid me),saluted Kasyapa reverentially,and proceeded to the Kshîroda sea, in order to see Kesava (Vishnu).
1	34	She beheld (then) the ocean, from which the Amrita arose. It was lovely, like the rays of the moon, and agitated by hundreds of waves produced by stormy blasts of wind.
1	35	(With its waves) towering like a hundred Himâlayas it seemed another terrestrial globe, calling near as it were the earth with its hands; the rolling waves.
1	36	With those hands it was as it were constantly producing the radiancy of the moon; and every stain of guilt was removed from it by Hari's (Vishnu's) residence within its limits.
1	37	Because (it was entirely free from sin) therefore it was possessed of a pure and shining frame; its colour was white; it was inaccessible to birds and its seat was in the lower regions.
1	38	It was rich in blue and tawny gems (sapphires, coral, and others), and looking therefore as if the atmosphere had descended upon the earth, and as if a number of forests adorned with a multitude of fruits had descended upon its surface.
1	39	Its size was immense, like that of the skin of (Vishnu's) serpent Sesha. After having seen the milk-ocean, the goddess of the earth beheld the dwelling of Kesava (Vishnu) which was in it:
1	40	(His dwelling), the size of which cannot be expressed in words, and, the sublimity of which is also beyond the power of utterance. In it she saw the destroyer of Madhu seated upon Sesha.
1	41	The lotus of his face was hardly visible onaccount of the lustre of the gems decorating the neck of the snake Sesha; he was shining like a hundred moons; and his splendour was equal to the rays of a myriad of suns.
1	42	He was clad in a yellow robe (radiant like gold); imperturbable; decorated with all kinds of gems; and shining with the lustre of a diadem resembling the sun in colour, and with (splendid) ear-rings.
1	43	Lakshmî was stroking his feet with her soft palms; and his attributes (the shell, the discus, the mace, and the lotus-flower) wearing bodies were attending upon him on all sides.
1	44	Having espied the lotus-eyed slayer of Madhu, she knelt down upon the ground and addressed him as follows:
1	45	'When formerly I was sunk into the region of Rasâtala, I was raised by thee, O God, and restored to my ancient seat, O Vishnu, thanks to thy benevolence towards living beings.
1	46	'Being there, how am I to maintain myself upon it, O lord of the gods?' Having been thus addressed by the goddess, the god enunciated the following answer:
1	47	'Those who practise the duties ordained for each caste and for each order, and who act up strictly to the holy law, will sustain thee, O earth; to them is thy care committed.'
1	48	Having received this answer, the goddess of the earth said to the chief of the gods, 'Communicate to me the eternal laws of the castes and of the orders.
1	49	I desire to learn them from thee; for thou art my chief stay. Adoration be to thee, O brilliant chief of the gods, who annihilatest the power of the (Daityas and other) enemies of the gods.
1	50	'O Nârâyana (son of Nara), O Gagannâtha (sovereign of the world); thou holdest the shell, the discus, and the mace (in thy hands); thou hast a lotus (Brahman) springing from thy navel; thou art the lord of the senses; thou art Most powerful and endowed with conquering strength.
1	51	'Thou art beyond the cognisance of the senses; thy end is most difficult to know; thou art brilliant; thou holdest the bow Sârnga; thou art the boar; thou art terrible; thou art Govinda (the herdsman); thou art of old; thou art Purushottama (the spirit supreme).
1	52	'Thy hair is golden; thy eyes are everywhere; thy body is the sacrifice; thou art free from stain; thou art the "field." (the corporeal frame); thou art the principle of life; thou art the ruler; thou art the teacher of religious rites; thou art of old; thou art Purushottama.
1	57	, 'Thou art not to be shaken; thou art undecaying;thou art the producer of the atoms; thou art kind to faithful attendants; thou art the purifier (of sinners); thou art the protector of all the gods thou art the protector of the pious.
1	58	'Thou art also the protector of those who know the Veda, O Purushottama. I have come, O Gagannâtha, to the immovable Vâkaspati (the lord of holy speech), the lord;
1	59	'To him, who is very pious; invincible; Vasushena (who has treasures for his armies); who bestows largesses upon his followers, who is endowed with the power of intense devotion; who is the germ of the ether; from whom the rays (of the sun and moon) proceed;
1	60	'To Vâsudeva; the great soul of the universe; whose eyes are like lotuses; who is eternal; the preceptor of the Suras and of the Asuras; brilliant; omnipresent; the great lord of all creatures;
1	61	'Who has one body and four faces; who is the producer of (the five grosser elements, ether, air, fire, water, and earth), the producers of the world. Teach me concisely, O Bhagavat, the eternal laws ordained for the aggregate of the four castes,
1	62	'Together with the customs to be observed by each order and with the secret ordinances.' The chief of the gods, thus addressed by the goddess of the earth, replied to her as follows:
1	63	Learn from me, in a concise form, O radiant goddess of the earth, the eternal laws for the aggregate of the four castes, together with the customs to be observed by each order, and with the secret ordinances,
1	64	'Which will effect the final liberation of the virtuous persons, who will support thee. Be seated upon this splendid golden seat, O handsome-thighed goddess.
1	65	'Seated at ease, listen to me proclaiming the sacred laws.' The goddess of the earth, thereupon, seated at case, listened to the sacred precepts as, they came from the mouth of Vishnu.
2	1	Brâhmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, and Sûdras are the four castes.
2	2	The first three of these are (called) twice-born.
2	3	For them the whole number of ceremonies, which begin with the impregnation and end with the ceremony of burning the dead body, have to be performed with (the recitation of) Mantras.
2	4	Their duties are.
2	5	For a Brâhmana, to teach (the Veda);
2	6	For a Kshatriya, constant practice in arms;
2	7	For a Vaisya, the tending of cattle;
2	8	For a Sûdra, to serve the twice-born;
2	9	For all the twice-born, to sacrifice and to study (the Veda).
2	10	Again, their modes of livelihood are:
2	11	For a Brâhmana, to sacrifice for others and to receive alms;
2	12	For a Kshatriya, to protect the world (and receive due reward, in form of taxes);
2	13	For a Vaisya, tillage, keeping cows (and other cattle), traffic, lending money upon interest, and growing seeds;
2	14	For a Sûdra, all branches of art (such as painting and the other fine arts);
2	15	In times of distress, each caste may follow the occupation of that next (below) to it in rank.
2	16	Forbearance, veracity, restraint, purity, liberality, self-control, not to kill (any living obedience towards one's Gurus, visiting places of pilgrimage, sympathy (with the afflicted),
2	17	Straightforwardness, freedom from covetousness, reverence towards gods and Brâhmanas, and freedom from anger are duties common (to all castes).
3	1	Now the duties of a king, are:
3	2	To protect his people,
3	3	And to keep the four castes and the four orders in the practice of their several duties.
3	4	Let the king fix his abode in a district containing open plains, fit for cattle, and abounding in grain;
3	5	And inhabited by many Vaisyas and Sûdras.
3	6	There let him reside in a stronghold (the strength of which consists) either in (its being surrounded by) a desert, or in (a throng of) armedmen, or in fortifications (of stone, brick, or others), or in water (enclosing it on all sides), or in trees, or in mountains (sheltering it against a foreign invasion).
3	7	(While he resides) there, let him appoint chiefs (or governors) in every village;
3	8	Also, lords of every ten villages;
3	9	And lords of every hundred villages;
3	10	And lords of a whole district.
3	11	If any offence has been committed in a village, let the lord of that village suppress the evil (and give redress to those that have been wronged).
3	12	If he is unable to do so, let him announce it to the lord of ten villages;
3	13	If he too is unable, let him announce it to the lord of a hundred villages;
3	14	If he too is unable, let him announce it to the lord of the whole district.
3	15	The lord of the whole district must eradicate the evil to the best of his power.
3	16	Let the king appoint able officials for the working of his mines, for the levying of taxes and of the fares to be paid at ferries, and for his elephants and forests.
3	17	(Let him appoint) pious persons for performing acts of piety (such as bestowing gifts on the indigent, and the like);
3	18	Skilled men for financial business (such as examining gold and other precious metals);
3	19	Brave men for fighting;

3	22	He must take from his subjects as taxes a sixth part every year of the grain;

3	26	Let him not levy any tax upon Brâhmanas.
3	27	For they pay taxes to him in the shape of their pious acts.
3	28	A sixth part both of the virtuous deeds and of the iniquitous acts committed by his subjects goes to the king.
3	29	Let him take a tenth part of (the price of) marketable commodities (sold) in his own country;
3	30	And a twentieth part of (the price of) goods (sold) in another country.
3	31	Any (seller or buyer) who (fraudulently) avoids a toll-house (situated on his road), shall lose all his goods.
3	32	Artizans (such as blacksmiths), manual labourers (such as carpenters), and Sûdras shall do work for the king for a day in each month.
3	33	The monarch, his council, his fortress, his treasure, his army, his realm, and his ally are the seven constituent elements of a state.
3	34	(The king) must punish those who try to subvert any one among them.
3	35	He must explore, by means of spies, both the state of his own kingdom and of his foe's.
3	36	Let him show honour to the righteous;
3	37	And let him punish the unrighteous.
3	38	Towards his (neighbour and natural) enemy, his ally (or the power next beyond his enemy), a neutral power (situated beyond the latter), and a power situated between (his natural enemy and an aggressive power): let him adopt (alternately), as the occasion and the time require, (the four modes of obtaining success, viz.) negotiation, division, presents, and force of arms.
3	39	Let him have resort, as the time demands, to (the six measures of a military monarch, viz.) making alliance and waging war, marching to battle and sitting encamped, seeking the protection (of a more powerful king) and distributing his forces.
3	40	Let him set out on an expedition in the months of Kaitra or Mârgasîrsha;
3	41	Or when some calamity has befallen his foe.
3	42	Having conquered the country of his foe, let him not abolish (or disregard) the laws of that country.
3	43	And when he has been attacked by his foe, let him protect his own realm to the best of his power.
3	44	There is no higher duty for men of the military caste, than to risk their life in battle.
3	45	Those who have been killed in protecting a cow, or a Brâhmana, or a king, or a friend, or their own property, or their own wedded wife, or their own life, go to heaven.
3	46	Likewise, those (who have been killed) in trying to prevent mixture of castes (caused by adulterous connections).
3	47	A king having conquered the capital of his foe, should invest there a prince of the royal race of that country with the royal dignity.
3	48	Let him not extirpate the royal race
3	49	Unless the royal race bc of ignoble descent.
3	50	He must not take delight in hunting, dice, women, and drinking;

3	52	And let him not injure his own property (by bootless expenses).
3	53	He must not demolish (whether in his own town, or in the town of his foe conquered by him,or in a fort) doors which had been built there before his time (by a former king).
3	54	He must not bestow largesses upon unworthy persons (such as dancers, eulogists, bards, and the like).
3	55	Of mines let him take the whole produce.
3	56	Of a treasure-trove he must give one half to the Brâhmanas;
3	57	He may deposit the other half in his own treasury.
3	58	A Brâhmana who has found a treasure may keep it entire.
3	59	A Kshatriya (who has found a treasure) must give one fourth of it to the king, another fourth to the Brâhmanas, and keep half of it to himself
3	60	A Vaisya (who has found a treasure) must give a fourth part of it to the king, one half to the Brâhmanas, and keep the (remaining fourth) part to himself.
3	61	A Sûdra who has found a treasure must divide it into twelve parts, and give five parts to the king, five parts to the Brâhmanas, and keep two parts to himself.
3	62	Let the king compel him who (having found a treasure) does not announce it (to the king) and is found out afterwards, to give up the whole.
3	63	Of a treasure anciently hidden by themselves let (members of) all castes, excepting Brâhmanas, give a twelfth part to the king.
3	64	The man who falsely claims property hidden by another to have been hidden by himself, shall becondemned to pay a fine equal in amount to the property falsely claimed by him.
3	65	The king must protect the property of minors, of (blind, lame or other) helpless persons (who have no guide), and of women (without a guardian).
3	66	Having recovered goods stolen by thieves, let him restore them entire to their owners, to whatever caste they may belong.
3	67	If he has been unable to recover them, he must pay (their value) out of his own treasury.
3	68	Let him appease the onsets of fate by ceremonies averting evil omens and propitiatory ceremonies;
3	69	And the onsets of his foe (let him repel) by force of arms.
3	70	Let him appoint as Purohita (domestic priest) a man conversant with the Vedas, Epics, the Institutes of Sacred Law, and (the science of) what is useful in life, of a good family, not deficient in limb, and persistent in the practice of austerities.
3	71	And (let him appoint) ministers (to help and advise him) in all his affairs, who are pure, free from covetousness, attentive, and able.
3	72	Let him try causes himself, accompanied by well-instructed Brâhmanas.
3	73	Or let him entrust a Brâhmana, with the judicial business.
3	74	Let the king appoint as judges men of goodfamilies, for whom the ceremonies (of initiation and so forth) have been performed, and who are eager in keeping religious vows, impartial towards friend and foe, and not likely to be corrupted by litigants either by (ministering to their) lustful desires or by (stimulating them to) wrath or by (exciting their) avarice or by other (such practices).
3	75	Let the king in all matters listen to (the advice of) his astrologers.

3	80	Nor any other man leading a pious life.
3	81	Let him bestow landed property upon Brâhmanas.
3	82	To those upon whom he has bestowed (land) he must give a document, destined for the information of a future ruler, which must be written upon a piece of (cotton) cloth, or a copper-plate, and must contain the names of his (three) immediate ancestors, a declaration of the extent of the land, and an imprecation against him who should appropriate thedonation to himself, and should be signed with his own seal.
3	83	Let him not appropriate to himself landed property bestowed (upon Brâhmanas) by other (rulers).

3	92	Let him inflict punishments according to justice (either personally or through his attendants).
3	93	Let him pardon no one for having offended twice.
3	94	He who deviates from his duty must certainly not be left unpunished by the king.
3	95	Where punishment with a black hue and a red eye advances with irresistible might, the king deciding causes justly, there the people will prosper.
3	96	Let a king in his own domain inflict punishments according to justice, chastise foreign foes with rigour, behave without duplicity to his affectionate friends, and with lenity to Brâhmanas.
3	97	Of a king thus disposed, even though he subsist by gleaning, the fame is far spread in the world, like a drop of oil in the water.
3	98	That king who is pleased when his subjects are joyful, and grieved when they are in grief, will obtain fame in this world, and will be raised to a high station in heaven after his death.

5	15	Breakers of dikes;
5	16	And such as give shelter and food to robbers,

6	23	There are three means of proof in case of a demand having been contested, viz. a writing, witnesses, and proof by ordeal.
6	24	A debt contracted before witnesses should be discharged in the presence of witnesses.

7	1	Documents are of three kinds:
7	2	Attested by the king, or by (other) witnesses, or unattested.
7	3	A document is (said to be) attested by the king when it has been executed (in a court of judicature), on the king ordering it, by a scribe, hisservant, and has been signed by his chief judge, with his own hand.
7	4	It is (said to be) attested by, witnesses when, having been written anywhere, and by any one, it is signed by witnesses in their own hands.
7	5	It is (said to be) unattested when it has been written (by the party himself) with his own hand.
7	6	Such a document, if it has been caused to be written by force, makes no evidence.
7	7	Neither does any fraudulent document (make evidence);
7	8	Nor a document (which), though attested, (is vitiated) by the signature of a witness bribed (by one party) or of bad character;
7	9	Nor one written by a scribe of the same description;
7	10	Nor one executed by a woman, or a child, or a dependant person, or one intoxicated or insane, or one in danger or in bodily fear.
7	11	(That instrument is termed) proof which is not adverse to peculiar local usages, which defines clearly the nature of the pledge given, and is free from confusion in the arrangement of the subject matter and (in the succession of) the syllables.
7	12	If the authenticity of a document is contested, it should be ascertained by (comparing with it other)letters or signs (such as the flourish denoting the word Srî and the like) or documents executed by the same man, by (enquiring into) the probabilities of the case, and by (finding out such writings as show) a mode of writing similar (to that contained in the disputed document).
7	13	Should the debtor, or creditor, or witness, or scribe be dead, the authenticity of the document has to be ascertained by (comparing with it other.) specimens of their handwriting.
8	1	Now follow (the laws regarding) witnesses.
8	2	The king cannot be (made a witness); nor a learned Brâhmana; nor an ascetic; nor a gamester; nor a thief; nor a person not his own master; nor a woman; nor a child; nor a perpetrator of the acts called sâhasa (violence); nor one over-aged (or more than eighty years old); nor one intoxicated or insane; nor a man of bad fame; nor an outcast;nor one tormented by hunger or thirst; nor one oppressed by a (sudden) calamity (such as the death of his father or the like), or wholly absorbed in evil passions;
8	3	Nor an enemy or a friend; nor one interested in the subject matter; nor one who does forbidden acts; nor one formerly perjured; nor an attendant;
8	4	Nor one who, without having been appointed, comes and offers his evidence;
8	5	Nor can one man alone be made a witness.
8	6	In cases of theft, of violence, of abuse and assault, and of adultery the competence of witnesses must not be examined too strictly.
8	7	Now (those who are fit to be) witnesses (shall he enumerated):
8	8	Descendants of a noble race, who are virtuous and wealthy, sacrificers, zealous in the practice of religious austerities, having male issue, well versed in the holy law, studious, veracious, acquainted with the three Vedas, and aged (shall be witnesses).
8	9	If he is endowed with the qualities just mentioned, one man alone can also be made a witness.
8	10	In a dispute between two litigants, the witnesses of that party have to be examined from which the plaint has proceeded.
8	11	Where the claim has been refuted as not agreeing with the facts (as e. g. the sum claimedhaving been repaid by the debtor), there the witnesses of the defendant have to be examined as well.
8	12	An appointed witness having died or gone abroad, those who have heard his deposition may give evidence.
8	13	(The evidence of) witnesses is (of two kinds): either of what was seen, or of what was heard.
8	14	Witnesses are free from blame if they give true evidence.
8	15	Whenever the death of a member of any of the four castes (would be occasioned by true evidence, they are free from blame) if they give false evidence.
8	16	In order to expiate the sin thus committed, such a witness), if he belongs to a twice-born caste, must pour an oblation in the fire, consecrating it with the texts called Kûshmândî.
8	17	If he is a Sûdra, he must feed ten cows for one day.IS. A false witness may be known by his altered looks, by his countenance changing colour, and by his talk wandering from the subject.
8	19	Let the judge summon the witnesses, at the time of sunrise, and examine them after having bound them by an oath.
8	20	A Brâhmana he must address thus, 'Declare.'
8	21	A Kshatriya he must address thus, 'Declare the truth.'
8	22	A Vaisya he must address thus, 'Thy kine, grain, and gold (shall yield thee no fruit, if thou wert to give false evidence).'
8	23	A Sûdra he must address thus, 'Thou shalt have to atone for all (possible) heavy crimes (if thou wert to give false evidence).'
8	24	Let him exhort the witnesses (with the following speeches):
8	25	'Whatever places (of torture) await (the killer of a Brâhmana and other) great criminals and (the killer of a cow and other) minor offenders, those places of abode are ordained for a witness who gives false evidence;
8	26	'And the fruit of every virtuous apt he has done, from the day of his birth to his dying day, shall be lost to him.
8	27	'Truth makes the sun spread his rays.
8	28	'Truth makes the moon shine.
8	29	'Truth makes the wind blow.
8	30	'Truth makes the earth bear (all that is upon it).
8	31	'Truth makes waters flow.
8	32	'Truth makes the fire burn.
8	33	'The atmosphere exists through truth.
8	34	'So do the gods.
8	35	'And so do the offerings.
8	36	'If veracity and a thousand horse-sacrificesare weighed against each other, (it is found that) truth ranks even higher than a thousand horse-sacrifices.
8	37	'Those who, though acquainted with the facts, and appointed to give evidence, stand mute, are equally criminal with, and deserve the same punishment as, false witnesses.' (After having addressed them) thus, let. the king examine the witnesses in the order of their castes.
8	38	That plaintiff whose statement the witnesses declare to be true, shall win his suit; but he whose statement they declare to be wrong, shall certainly lose it.
8	39	If there is contradictory evidence, let the king decide by the plurality of witnesses; if equality in number, by superiority in virtue; if parity in virtue, by the evidence of the best among the twice-born.
8	40	Whenever a perjured witness has given false evidence in a suit, (the king) must reverse the judgment; and whatever has been done, must be considered as undone.
9	1	Now follows (the rule regarding) the performance of ordeals.
9	2	In cases of a criminal action directed against the king, or of violence (they may be administered) indiscriminately.
9	3	In cases of (denial of) a deposit or of (alleged.)theft or robbery they must be administered each according to the value (of the property claimed).
9	4	In all such cases the value (of the object claimed) must be estimated in gold.
9	5	Now if its value amounts to less than one Krishnala, a Sûdra must be made to swear by a blade of Dûrvâ grass, (which he must hold in his hand);
9	6	If it amounts to less than two Krishnala, by a blade of Tila;
9	7	If it amounts to less than three Krishnala, by a blade of silver;
9	8	If it amounts to less than four Krishnala, by a blade of gold;
9	9	If it amounts to less than five Krishnala, by a lump of earth taken from a furrow;
9	10	If it amounts to less than half a Suvarna, a Sûdra must be made to undergo the ordeal by sacred libation;
9	11	If it exceeds that amount, (the judge must administer to him) any one of the (other) ordeals, viz. the ordeal by, the balance, by fire, by water, or by poison, considering duly (the season, &c.)
9	12	If the amount (of the matter in contest) is twice as high (as in each of the last-mentioned cases), a Vaisya must (in each case) undergo that ordeal which has (just) been ordained (for a Sûdra);
9	13	A Kshatriya (must undergo the same ordeals), if the amount is thrice as high;
9	14	A Brâhmana, if it is four times as high. He is, however, not subject to the ordeal by sacred libation.
9	15	No judge must administer the (ordeal by) sacred libation to a Brâhmana;
9	16	Except if it be done as a preliminary proof of his dealing fairly in some future transaction.
9	17	Instead of (administering the ordeal by) sacred libation to a Brâhmana (in suits regarding an object, the value of which amounts to less than two Suvarnas), let the judge cause him to swear by a lump of earth taken from a furrow.
9	18	To one formerly convicted of a crime (or of perjury) he must administer one of the ordeals, even though the matter in contest be ever so trifling.
9	19	But to one who is known (and esteemed) among honest men and virtuous, he must not (administer any ordeal), even though the matter in contest be ever so important.
9	20	The claimant must declare his willingness to pay the fine (which is, due in case of his being defeated);
9	21	And the defendant must go through the ordeal.
9	22	In cases of a criminal action directed against the, king, or of violence (an ordeal may be administered) even without (the claimant) promising to pay the fine (due in case of defeat in ordinary suits).
9	23	To women, Brâhmanas, persons deficient in an organ of sense, infirm (old) men, and sick persons, the (ordeal by the) balance must be administered.
9	24	But it must not be administered to them while a wind is blowing.
9	25	The (ordeal by) fire must not be administered to lepers, to infirm persons, or to blacksmiths;
9	26	Nor must it ever be administered in autumn or summer.
9	27	The (ordeal by) poison must not be administered to lepers, bilious persons, or Brâhmanas;
9	28	Nor during the rainy season.
9	29	The (ordeal by) water must not be administered to persons afflicted with phlegm or (another) illness, to the timid, to the asthmatic, nor to those who gain their subsistence from water (such as fishermen and the like);
9	30	Nor during (the two cold seasons) Hemanta and Sisira (or from middle of November to middle of March);
9	31	The (ordeal by) sacred libation must not be administered to atheists;
9	32	Nor when the country is afflicted with disease or pestilence.
9	33	Let the judge summon the defendant at the time of sunrise, after having, fasted on the previous day and bathed in his clothes, and make him go through all the ordeals in the presence of (images of) the gods and of the (assessors and other) Brâhmanas.
10	1	Now follows the (rule regarding the ordeal by) balance.
10	2	; The transverse beam, by which the balance is to be suspended, should be fastened upon two posts, four Hastas above the ground (each), and should be made two Hastas long.
10	3	The beam of the balance should be made of strong wood (such as that of the Khadira or Tinduka trees), five Hastas long, and the two scales must be suspended on both sides of it, (and the whole suspended upon the transverse beam by means of an iron hook).
10	4	A man out of the guild of goldsmiths, or of braziers, should make it equal on both sides.
10	5	Into the one scale the person (who is to be tried by this ordeal) should be placed, and a stone (or earth or bricks) or some other (equivalent) of the same weight into the other.
10	6	The equivalent and the man having been made equal in weight and (the position of the scales) well marked, the man should be caused to descend from the balance.
10	7	Next (the judge) should adjure by (the following) imprecations the balance
10	8	And the person appointed to look after the weighing:
10	9	Those places of torture which have been prepared for the murderer of a Brâhmana, or for a false witness, the same places are ordained for a who person appointed to look after the weighing, who acts fraudulently in his office.
10	10	'Thou, O balance (dhata), art called by the same name as holy law (dharma); thou, O balance, knowest what mortal., do not comprehend.
10	11	'This man, being arraigned in a cause, is weighed upon thee. Therefore mayest thou deliver him lawfully from this perplexity.'
10	12	Thereupon the judge should have him placed, into the one scale again. If he rises in it, he is freed from the charge according to law.
10	13	In case of the strings bursting, or of the splitting of the transverse beam, the man should be placed in the scale once more. Thus the facts will be ascertained positively, and a just sentence be the result.
11	1	Now follows the (rule regarding the ordeal by) fire.
11	2	He must make seven circles, sixteen Angulas in breadth each, the intervals being of the same breadth.
11	3	Thereupon he must place seven leaves of theholy fig-tree into the hands of the person (about to perform the ordeal), who must turn his face towards the east and stretch out both arms.
11	4	Those (leaves) and his hands he must bind together with a thread.
11	5	Then he must place into his hands a ball made of iron, red-hot, fifty Palas in weight, and smooth.
11	6	Having received this, the person must proceed through the (seven) circles, without either walking at a very hurried pace, or lingering on his way.
11	7	Finally, after having passed the seventh circle, he must put down the ball upon the ground.
11	8	That man whose hands are burnt ever so little, shall be deemed guilty; but if he remains wholly unburnt, he is freed from the charge.
11	9	If he lets the ball drop from fear, or if there exists a doubt as to whether he is burnt or not, let him take the ball once more, because the proof has not been decided.
11	10	At the beginning (of the whole ceremony) the judge shall cause the person to rub some rice in his hands, and shall mark (with red sap, or the like, the already existing scars, eruptions of the skin, &c., which will thus have become visible). Then the judge, after having addressed the iron ball (with the following prayer), shall place it in his hands:'Thou, O fire, dwellest in the interior of all creatures, like a witness. O fire, thou knowest what mortals do not comprehend.
11	12	'This man being arraigned in a cause, desires to be cleared from guilt. Therefore mayest thou deliver him lawfully from this perplexity.'
12	1	Now follows the (rule regarding the ordeal by) water.
12	2	(The defendant must enter) water which is free from mud, aquatic plants, (crabs and other) vicious animals, (porpoises or other) large rapacious animals living in water, fish, leeches, and other (animals or plants),
12	3	The water having been addressed with the Mantras (mentioned hereafter), he must enter it, seizing the knees of another man, who must be free from friendship or hatred, and must dive into the water up to his navel.
12	4	At the same time another man must discharge an arrow from a bow, which must neither be too strong nor too weak.
12	5	That arrow must be fetched quickly by another man.
12	6	He who is not seen above the water in the mean time is proclaimed innocent. But in the contrary case he is (declared) guilty, even though one limb of his only has become visible.
12	7	'Thou, O water, dwellest in the interior of all creatures, like a witness. O water, thou knowest what mortals do not comprehend.
12	8	'This man being arraigned in a cause, desires to be cleared from guilt. Therefore mayest thou deliver him, lawfully from this perplexity.'
13	1	Now follows the (rule regarding the ordeal by) poison.
13	2	All (other) sorts of poison must be avoided (in administering this ordeal),
13	3	Except poison from the Sringa tree, which grows on the Himâlayas.
13	4	(Of that) the judge must give seven grains, mixed with clarified butter, to the defendant (while reciting the prayer hereafter mentioned).
13	5	If the poison is digested easily, without violent symptoms, he shall recognise him as innocent, and dismiss him at the end of the day.
13	6	'On account of thy venomous and dangerous nature thou art destruction to all living creatures; thou, O poison, knowest what mortals, do not comprehend.
13	7	'This man being arraigned in a cause, desires to be cleared from guilt. Therefore mayest thou deliver him lawfully from this perplexity.'
14	1	Now follows the (rule regarding the ordeal by) sacred libation.
14	2	Having invoked terrible deities (such as Durgâ, the Âdityas or others, the defendant) must drink three handfuls of water in which (images of) those deities have been bathed,
14	3	Uttering at the same time the words, 'I have not done this,' with his face turned towards the deity (in question).
14	4	He to whom (any calamity) happens within a fortnight or three weeks (such as an illness, or fire, or the death of a relative, or a heavy visitation by the king),
14	5	Should be known to be guilty; otherwise (if nothing adverse happens to him), he is freed from the charge. A just king should honour (with presents of clothes, ornaments, &c.) one who has cleared himself from guilt by an ordeal.
15	1	Now there are twelve kinds of sons.
15	2	The first is the son of the body, viz. he who is begotten (by the husband) himself on his own lawfully wedded wife.
15	3	The second is the soil begotten on a wife, viz. one begotten by a kinsman allied by funeral oblations, or by a member of the highest caste, on an appointed (wife or widow).
15	4	The third is the son of an appointed daughter.
15	5	She is called an appointed daughter, who is given away by her father with the words, 'The son whom she bears be mine.'
15	6	A damsel who has no brother is also (in every case considered) an appointed daughter, though she has not been given away according to the rule of an appointed daughter.
15	7	The son of a twice-married woman is the fourth.
15	8	She who, being still a virgin, is married for the second time is called twice married (punarbhû).
15	9	She also is called twice married (punarbhû) who, though not legally married more than once, has lived with another man before her lawful marriage.
15	10	The son of an unmarried damsel is the fifth.
15	11	(He is called so who is) born by an unmarried daughter in the house of her father.
15	12	And he belongs to the man who (afterwards) marries the mother.
15	13	The son who is secretly born in the house is the sixth.
15	14	He belongs to him in whose bed he is born.
15	15	The son received with a bride is the seventh.
15	16	He (is called so who) is the son of a woman married while she was pregnant.
15	17	And he belongs to the husband (of the pregnant bride).
15	18	The adopted son (dattaka) is the eighth.
15	19	And he belongs to him to whom he is given by his mother or father.
15	20	The son bought is the ninth.
15	21	And he belongs to him by whom he is bought.
15	22	The son self-given is the tenth.
15	23	And he belongs to him to whom he gave himself
15	24	The son cast away is the eleventh.
15	25	(He is called so) who was forsaken by his father or mother (or by both).
15	26	And he belongs to him by whom he is received.
15	27	The son born by any woman whomsoever is the twelfth.
15	28	Amongst these (sons) each preceding one is preferable (to the one next in order).
15	29	And he takes the inheritance (before the next in order).
15	30	And let him maintain the rest.
15	31	He should marry unmarried (sisters) in a manner correspondent with the amount of his property.
15	32	Outcasts, eunuchs, persons incurably diseased, or deficient (in organs of sense or actions, such as blind, deaf, dumb, or insane persons, or lepers) do not receive a share.
15	33	They, should be maintained by those who take the inheritance.
15	34	And their legitimate sons receive a share.
15	35	But not the children of an outcast;
15	36	Provided they were born after (the commission of) the act on account of which the parents were outcasted.
15	37	Neither do children begotten (by husbands ofan inferior caste) on women of a higher caste receive a share,
15	38	Their sons do not even receive a share of the wealth of their paternal grandfathers.
15	39	They should be supported by the heirs.
15	40	And he who inherits the wealth, presents the funeral oblation (to the deceased).
15	41	Amongst wives of one husband also the son of one is the son of all (and must present funeral oblations to them after their death).
15	42	Likewise, amongst brothers begotten by, one (father, the son of one is the son of all, and must present funeral oblations to them all).
15	43	Let a son present the funeral oblations to his father, even though he inherit no property.
15	44	Because he saves (trâyate) his father from the hell called Put, therefore (a male child) is called put-tra (protector from Put, son) by Svayambhû himself
15	45	He (the father) throws his debt on him (the son); and the father obtains immortality, if he sees the face of a loving son.
15	46	Through a son he conquers the worlds. through a grandson he obtains immortality, and through the soil's grandson he gains the world of the sun.
15	47	No difference is made in this world between the son of a son and the son of a daughter; for even a daughter's son works the salvation of a childless man, just like a son's son.
16	1	On women equal in caste (to their husbands) sons are begotten, who are equal in caste (to their fathers).
16	2	On women of lower caste than their husbands sons are begotten, who follow the caste of their mothers.
16	3	On women of higher caste than their husbands sons are begotten, who are despised by the twice-born.
16	4	Among these, the son of a Sûdra with a Vaisya woman is called Âyogava.
16	5	The Pukkasa and Mâgadha are sons of a Vaisya and Sûdra respectively with a Kshatriya woman.
16	6	The Kandâla, Vaidehaka, and Sûta are the sons of a Sûdra, Vaisya, and Kshatriya respectively with a Brâhmana woman.
16	7	Besides these, there are innumerable other mixed castes produced by further intermixture between those that have been mentioned.
16	8	Âyogavas must live by artistic performances (such as public wrestling, dancing, and the like).
16	9	Pukkasas must live by hunting.
16	10	Mâgadhas must live by calling out in public the good qualities (of saleable commodities).
16	11	Kandâlas must live by executing criminals sentenced to death.
16	12	Vaidehakas must live by keeping (dancing girls and other public) women and profiting by what they earn.
16	13	Sûtas must live by managing horses.
16	14	Kandâlas must live out of the town, and their clothes must be the mantles of the deceased. In this their condition is different (from, and lower than that of the other mixed castes).
16	15	All (members of mixed castes) should have intercourse (of marriage, and other community) only between themselves.
16	16	(In the lower castes also) the son inherits the property of his father.
16	17	All members of those mixed castes, whether their descent has been kept secret or is generally known, may be found out by their acts.
16	18	Desertion of life, regardless of reward, in order to save a Brâhmana, or a cow, or for the sake of a woman or child, may confer heavenly bliss even upon (members of those) base castes.
17	1	If a father makes a partition with his sons, he may dispose of his self-acquired property as he thinks best.
17	2	But in regard to wealth 'inherited of the paternal grandfather, the ownership of father and son is equal.
17	3	(Sons), who have separated from their father, should give a share to (a brother) who is born after partition.
17	4	The wealth of a man who dies without male issue goes to his wife;
17	5	On failure of her, to his daughter;
17	6	On failure of her, to his father;
17	7	On failure of him, to his mother;
17	8	On failure of her, to his brother;
17	9	On failure of him, to his brother's son;
17	10	On failure of him, to the relations called Bandhu;
17	11	On failure of them, to the relations called Sakulya;
17	12	On failure of them, to a fellow-student;
17	13	On failure of him, it goes to the king, with the exception of a Brâhmana's property.
17	14	The property of a Brâhmana goes to (other) Brâhmanas.
17	15	The wealth of a (deceased) hermit shall be taken by his spiritual teacher;
17	16	Or his pupil (may take it).
17	17	But let a reunited coparcener take the share of his reunited coparcener who has died (without issue), and a uterine brother that of his uterine brother, and let them give (the shares of their deceased coparceners and uterine brothers) to the sons of the latter.
17	18	What has been given to a woman by her father, mother, sons, or brothers, what she has received before the sacrificial fire (at the marriage ceremony), what she receives on supersession, what has been given to her by her relatives, her fee (Sulka), and a gift subsequent, are called 'woman's property' (Strîdhana).
17	19	If a woman married according to (one of the first) four rites, beginning with the Brâhma rite, dies without issue, that (Strîdhana) belongs to her husband.
17	20	(If she has been married) according to (one of) the other (four reprehensible rites), her father shall take it.
17	21	If she dies leaving children, her wealth goes in every case to her daughter.
17	22	Ornaments worn by women when their husbands were alive, the heirs shall not divide among themselves; if they divide them, they become outcasts.
17	23	(Coparceners) descended from different fathers must adjust their shares according to the fathers. Let each take the wealth due to his father, no other (has a right to it).
18	1	If there are four sons of a Brâhmana (springing from four different wives) of the four castes, they shall divide the whole estate of their father into ten parts.
18	2	Of these, let the soil of the Brâhmana wife take four parts;
18	3	The son of the Kshatriya wife, three parts;
18	4	The son of the Vaisya wife, two parts;
18	5	The son of the Sûdra wife, a single part.
18	6	Again, if there are three sons of a Brâhmana (by wives of different castes), but no son by a Sûdra (wife) among them, they shall divide the estate into nine parts.
18	7	(Of these) let them take, each in the order of his caste, shares amounting to four, three, and two parts of the whole respectively.
18	8	(If there are three sons by wives of different castes, but) no Vaisya among them, they shall divide the estate into eight parts, and take four parts, three parts, and one part respectively.
18	9	(If there are three sons, but) no Kshatriya among them, they shall divide it into seven parts, and take four parts, two parts, and a single part respectively.
18	10	If there is no Brâhmana, among them, they hall divide it into six parts, and take three parts, two parts, and a single part respectively.
18	11	If there are sons of a Kshatriya by a Kshatriya, a Vaisya, and a Sûdra wife, the mode of division shall be the same (i.e. the estate shall be divided into six parts, &c.)
18	12	Again, if there are two sons of a Brâhmana, the one belonging to the Brâhmana and the other to the Kshatriya caste, they shall divide the estate into seven parts; and of these the Brâhmana son shall take four parts;
18	13	The Kshatriya son, three parts.
18	14	Again, if there are two sons of a Brâhmana, and the one belongs to the Brâhmana and the other to the Vaisya caste, the estate shall be divided into six parts; and of these, the Brâhmana shall take four parts;
18	15	The Vaisya, two parts.
18	10	Again, if there are two sons of a Brâhmana, and the one belongs to the Brâhmana and the other to the Sûdra caste, they shall divide the estate into five parts;
18	17	And of these, the Brâhmana shall take four parts;
18	18	The Sûdra, a single part.
18	19	Again, if there are two sons of a Brâhmana or a Kshatriya, and the one belongs to the Kshatriya and the other to the Sûdra caste, they shall divide the estate into five parts;
18	90	And of these, the Kshatriya shall take three parts;
18	21	The Sûdra, one part.
18	22	Again, if there are two sons of a Brâhmana or a Kshatriya, and the one belongs to the Kshatriya, the other to the Sûdra caste, they shall divide the estate into four parts;
18	23	And of these, the Kshatriya shall take three parts;
18	24	The Sûdra, a single part.
18	25	Again, if there are two sons of a Brâhmana or a Vaisya or a Sûdra, and the one belongs to the Vaisya, the other to the Sûdra caste, they shall divide the estate into three parts;
18	26	And of these, the Vaisya shall take two parts;
18	27	The Sûdra, a single part,
18	28	If a Brâhmana has an only son, he shall take the whole estate, provided he be a Brâhmana, Kshatriya, or Vaisya.
18	29	If a Kshatriya has (an only son who is) either a Kshatriya or a Vaisya, (the rule shall be the same.)
18	30	If a Vaisya has (an only son who is) Vaisya, (the rule shall also be the same);
18	31	(And so shall the only) son of a Sûdra (be sole heir) to his Sûdra (father).
18	32	A Sûdra, who is the only son of a father belonging to a twice-born caste, shall inherit one-half of his property;
18	33	The other half shall devolve in the same way as the property of one who died without leaving issue.
18	34	Mothers shall receive shares proportionate to their son's shares;
18	35	And so shall unmarried daughters.
18	36	Sons, who are equal in caste (to their father), shall receive equal shares.
18	37	A best part (the twentieth part of the inheritance, &c.) shall be given to the eldest, as his additional share.
18	38	If there are two sons by a Brâhmana and one by a Sûdra wife, the estate shall be divided into nine parts; and of these, the two sons of the Brâhmana wife shall take two parts, the one son of the Sûdra wife, a single part.
18	39	If there are two sons by a Sûdra, and one son by a Brâhmana wife, the estate shall be divided into six parts; and of these, the son of the Brâhmana wife shall take four parts, and the two sons of the Sûdra wife together shall take two parts.
18	40	Upon the same principles the shares have to be adjusted in other cases also.
18	41	If (brothers), who after a previous division of the estate live again together as parceners, should make a second partition, the shares must be equal in that case, and the eldest has no right to an additional share.
18	42	What a brother has acquired by, his own efforts, without using the patrimony, he must not give up (to his brothers or other co-heirs), unless by his own free will; for it was gained by his own exertion.
18	43	And if a man recovers (a debt or other property), which could not before be recovered by his father, he shall not, unless by his own free will, divide it with his sons; for it is an acquisition made by himself.
18	44	Apparel, vehicles (carriages or riding-horses), and ornaments (such as are usually worn according to the custom of the caste), prepared food, water (in a well or pool), females (slaves or mistresses of the deceased), property destined for pious uses or sacrifices, a common pasture-ground, and a book, are indivisible.
19	1	He must not cause a member of a twice-born caste to be carried out by a Sûdra (even though he be a kinsman of the deceased);
19	2	Nor a Sûdra by a member of a twice-born caste.
19	3	A father and a mother shall be carried out by their sons (who are equal in caste to their parents).
19	4	But Sûdras must never carry out a member of a twice-born caste, even though he be their father.
19	5	Those Brâhmanas who carry out (or follow the corpse of) a (deceased) Brâhmana who has no relatives shall attain a mansion in heaven.
19	6	Those who have carried out a dead relative and burnt his corpse, shall walk round the pile from left to right, and then plunge into water, dressed in their clothes.
19	7	After having offered a libation of water to the deceased, they must place one ball of rice on blades of Kusa grass, (and this ceremony has to be repeated on each subsequent day, while the period of impurity lasts.)
19	8	Then, having changed their dress, they mustbite Nimba leaves between their teeth, and having stepped upon the stone threshold, they must enter the house.
19	9	Then they must throw unbroken grains into the fire.
19	10	On the fourth day they must collect the bones that have been left.
19	11	And they must throw them into water from the Ganges.
19	12	As many bones of a man are contained in the water of the Ganges, so many thousands of years will he reside in heaven.
19	13	While the term of impurity lasts, they must continually offer a libation of water and a ball of rice to the deceased.
19	14	And they must eat food which has been bought, or which they have received unsolicited.
19	15	And they, must eat no meat.
19	16	And they must sleep on the ground.
19	17	And they must sleep apart.
19	18	When the impurity is over, they must walk forth from the village, have their beards shaved, and having cleansed themselves with a paste of sesamum, or with a paste of mustard-seed, they must change their dress and re-enter the house.
19	19	There, after reciting a propitiatory prayer, they must honour the Brâhmanas.
19	20	The gods are invisible deities, the Brâhmanas are visible deities.
19	21	The Brâhmanas sustain the world.
19	22	It is by the favour of the Brâhmanas that the gods reside in heaven; a speech uttered by Brâhmanas (whether a curse or a benediction) never fails to come true.
19	23	What the Brâhmanas pronounce, when highly pleased (as, if they promise sons, cattle, wealth, or some other boon to a man), the gods will ratify; when the visible gods are pleased, the invisible gods are surely pleased as well.
19	24	The mourners, who lament the loss of a relative, shall be addressed by men gifted with a tranquil frame of mind with such consolatory speeches as I shall now recite to thee, O Earth, who art cherished to my, mind.
20	1	The northern progress of the sun is a day, with the gods.
20	2	The southern progress of the sun is (with them) a night.
20	3	A year is (with them) a day and a night;
20	4	Thirty such are a month;
20	5	Twelve such months are a year.
20	6	Twelve hundred years of the gods are a Kaliyuga.
20	7	Twice as many (or two thousand four hundred) are a Dvâpara (Yuga).S. Thrice as many (or three thousand six hundred) are a Tretâ (Yuga).
20	9	Four times as many (or four thousand eight hundred) are a Krita Yuga.
20	10	(Thus) twelve thousand years make a Katuryuga (or period of four Yugas).
20	11	Seventy-one Katuryugas make a Manvantara (or period of a Manu).
20	12	A thousand Katuryugas make a Kalpa.
20	13	And that is a day of the forefather (Brahman).
20	14	His night also has an equal duration.
20	15	If so many such nights and days are put together that, reckoned by the month and by the year, they make up a period of a hundred years (of Brahman) it is called the age of one Brahman.
20	16	A day of Purusha (Vishnu) is equal in duration to the age of one Brahman.
20	17	When it ends, a Mahâkalpa is over.
20	18	The night following upon it is as long.
20	19	The days and nights of Purusha that have gone by are innumerable;
20	20	And so are those that will follow.
20	21	For Kâla (time) is without either beginning or end.
20	22	Thus it is, that in this Kâla (time), in whom there is nothing to rest upon, and who is everlasting, I can espy nothing created in which there is the least stability.
20	23	The sands in the Ganges and (the waters pouring down from the sky) when Indra sends raincan be counted, but not the number of 'Forefathers' (Brahmans) who have passed away.
20	24	In each Kalpa, fourteen chiefs of the gods (Indras) go to destruction, as many rulers of the world (kings), and fourteen Manus.
20	25	And so have many thousands of Indras and hundred thousands of princes of the Daityas (such as Hiranyakasipu, Hiranyâksha, and others) been destroyed by Kâla, (time). What should one say of human beings then?
20	26	'Many royal Rishis too (such as Sagara), all of them renowned for their virtues, gods and Brahmanical Rishis (such as Kasyapas) have perished by the action of Kâla.
20	27	Those even who have the power of creating and annihilating in this world (the sun, moon, and other heavenly bodies) continually perish by the act of Kâla; for Kâla (time) is hard to overcome.
20	28	Every creature is seized upon by Kâla and carried into the other world. It is the slave of its actions (in a former existence). Wherefore then should you wail (on its death)?
20	29	Those who are born are sure to die, and those who have died are sure to be born again. This is inevitable, and no associate can follow a man (in his passage through mundane existence).
20	30	As mourners will not help the dead in this world, therefore (the relatives) should not weep, but perform the obsequies to the best of their power.
20	31	As both his good and bad actions will followhim (after death) like associates. what does it matter to a man whether his relatives mourn over him or no?
20	32	But as long as his relatives remain impure, the departed spirit finds no rest, and returns to visit (his relatives), whose duty it is to offer tip to him the funeral ball of rice and the water libation.
20	33	Till the Sapindîkarana has been performed, the dead man remains a disembodied spirit (and is afflicted with hunger and thirst). Give rice and a jar with water to the man who has passed into the abode of disembodied spirits.
20	34	Having passed into the abode of the manes (after the performance of the Sapindîkarana) he enjoys in the shape of celestial food his portion of the Srâddha (funeral oblation); offer the Srâddha, therefore, to him who has passed into the abode of the manes.
20	35	Whether he has become a god, or stays in hell, or has entered the body of an animal, or of a human being, he will receive the Srâddha offered to him by his relatives.
20	36	The dead person and the performer of the Srâddha are sure to be benefitted by its performance. Perform the Srâddha always, therefore, abandoning bootless grief.
20	37	This is the duty which should be constantly discharged towards a dead person by his kinsmen; by mourning a man will neither benefit the dead nor himself.
20	38	Having seen that no help is to be had from this world, and that his relations are dying (one afterthe other), you must choose virtue for your only associate, O ye men.
20	39	Even were he to die with him, a kinsman is unable to follow his dead relative: all excepting his wife are forbidden to follow him on the path of Yama.
20	40	Virtue alone will follow him, wherever he, may go; therefore do your duty unflinchingly in this wretched world.
20	41	To-morrow's business should be done to-day, and the, afternoons business in the forenoon; for death will not wait, whether a person has done it or not.
20	42	While his mind is fixed upon his field, or traffic, or his house, or while his thoughts are engrossed by some other (beloved) object, death suddenly carries him away as his, prey, as a she-wolf catches a lamb.
20	43	Kâla (time) is no one's friend and no one's enemy: when the effect of his acts in a former existence, by which his present existence is caused, has expired, he snatches a man away forcibly.
20	44	He will not die before his time has come, even though he has been pierced by a thousand shafts; he will not live after his time is out, even though he has only been touched by the point of a blade of Kusa grass.
20	45	Neither drugs, nor magical formulas, norburnt-offerings, nor prayers will save a man who is in the bonds of death or old age.
20	46	An impending evil cannot be averted even by a hundred precautions; what reason then for you to complain?
20	47	Even as a calf finds his mother among a thousand cows, an act formerly done is sure to find the perpetrator.
20	48	Of existing beings the beginning is unknown, the middle (of their career) is known, and the end again unknown; what reason then for you to complain?
20	49	As the body of mortals undergoes (successively the vicissitudes of) infancy, youth, and old age, even so will it be transformed into another body (hereafter); a sensible man is not mistaken about that.
20	50	As a man puts on new clothes in this world, throwing aside those which he formerly wore, even so the self of man puts on new bodies, which are in accordance with his acts (in a former life).
20	51	No weapons will hurt the self of man, no fire burn it, no waters moisten it, and no wind dry it up.
20	52	It is not to be hurt, not to be burnt, not to be moistened, and not to be dried up; it is imperishable, perpetual, unchanging, immovable, without beginning.
20	53	It is (further) said to be immaterial, passing all thought, and immutable. Knowing the self of man to be such, you must not grieve (for the destruction of his body).
21	1	Now then , (on the day) after the impurity is over, let him bathe duly (during the recitation of Mantras), wash his hands and feet duly, and sip water duly, (and having invited some Brâhmanas), as many as possible, who must cleanse themselves in the same way and turn their faces towards the north, let him bestow presents of perfumes, garlands, clothes and other things (a lamp, frankincense, and the like) upon them, and hospitably entertain them.
21	2	At the Ekoddishta (or Srâddha for one recently deceased) let him alter the Mantras so as to refer to (the) one person (deceased).
21	3	Close to the food left (by the Brâhmanas) let him offer a ball of rice, at the same time calling out his name and (that of) his race.
21	4	The Brâhmanas having taken food and having been honoured with a gift, let him offer, as imperishable food, water to the Brâhmanas, after having called out the name and Gotra of the deceased; and let him dig three trenches, each four Angulas in breadth, their distance from one another and their depth also measuring (four Angulas), and their length amounting to one Vitasti (or twelve Angulas).
21	5	Close by the trenches let him light three fires, and having added fuel to them, let him make three oblations (of boiled rice) in each (fire, saying),
21	6	'Svadhâ and reverence to Soma, accompanied by the manes.
21	7	'Svadhâ and reverence to Agni, who conveys the oblations addressed to the manes.
21	8	'Svadhâ and reverence to Yama Angiras.'
21	9	Then let him offer balls of rice as (ordained) before  on the three mounds of earth (adjacent to the three trenches).
21	10	After having filled the three trenches with
 {p.
21	85	}rice, sour milk, clarified butter, honey, and meat, let him mutter (the Mantra), 'This is for you.'
21	11	This ceremony he must repeat monthly, on the day of his death.
21	12	At the close of the year let him give food to the Brâhmanas, after having fed the gods first, in honour of the deceased and of his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather.
21	13	At (the Ekoddishta belonging to) this ceremony let him perform the burnt-offering, the invitation, and (the offering of) water for washing the feet.
21	14	Then he must pour the water for washing the feet and the Arghya (water libation) destined for the deceased person into the three vessels containing the water for washing the feet, and the three other vessels containing the Arghya of his three ancestors. At the same time he must mutter(the two Mantras), 'May earth unite thee ,' and 'United your minds.'
21	15	Near the leavings he must make (and put) four balls of rice.
21	16	Let him show out the Brâhmanas, after they have sipped water duly and have been presented by him with their sacrificial fee.
21	17	Then let him knead together the ball of the deceased person with the three balls (of the three ancestors), as (he has mixed up) his water for washing the feet and his Arghya (with theirs).
21	18	Let him do the same (with the balls placed) near the three trenches.
21	19	Or  the Sapindîkarana must be performed on the thirteenth, after the monthly Srâddha has been performed on the twelfth day.
21	20	For Sûdras it should be performed on the twelfth day, without Mantras.
21	21	If there be an intercalary month in that year, he must add one day to the (regular days of the) monthly Srâddha.
21	22	The ceremony of investing women with the relationship of Sapinda has to be performed in the same manner. Later, he must perform a Srâddha every year, while he lives, (on the anniversary of the deceased relative's death).
21	23	He, for whom the ceremony of investing him with the, relationship of Sâpinda is performed after the lapse of a year, shall be honoured by the gift, (on each day) of that year, of food and a jar with water to a Brâhmana.
22	1	The impurity of a Brâhmana caused by the birth or death of Sapindas lasts ten days.
22	2	In the case of a Kshatriya (it lasts) twelve days.
22	3	In the case of a Vaisya (it lasts) fifteen days.
22	4	In the case of a Sûdra (it lasts) a month.
22	5	The relationship of Sapinda ceases with the seventh man (in descent or ascent).
22	6	During the period of impurity oblations (to the Visvedevâs), gifts and receiving of alms, and study have to be interrupted.
22	7	No one must eat the food of one impure (unless he be a Sapinda of his).
22	8	He who eats but once the food of Brâhmanas or others, while they are impure, will remain impure as long as they.
22	9	When the (period of) impurity is over, he must perform a penance (as follows):
22	10	If a twice-born man has eaten (the food) of a member of his own caste, while the latter was impure, he must approach a river and plunge into it, mutter the (hymn of) Aghamarshana three times, and, after having emerged from the water, must mutter the Gâyatrî one thousand and eight times.
22	11	If a Brâhmana has eaten the food of a Kshatriya, while the latter was impure, he is purified by performing the same penance and by fasting (on the previous day).
22	12	(The same penance is ordained for) a Kshatriya who has eaten the food of a Vaisya, while the latter was impure.
22	13	(The same penance is ordained for) a Brâhmana (who has eaten the food) of an impure Vaisya; but he must fast besides during the three (previous) days.
22	14	If a Kshatriya or a Vaisya (have eaten the food) of a Brâhmana or a Kshatriya respectively, who were impure, they must approach a river and mutter the Gâyatrî five hundred times.
22	15	A Vaisya, who has eaten the food of a Brâhmana, while the latter was impure, must (go to a river and) mutter the Gâyatrî one hundred and eight times.
22	16	A twice-born man (who has eaten the food), of a Sûdra, while the latter was impure must (go to a river and) perform the Prâgâpatya (penance).
22	17	A Sûdra (who has eaten the food) of an impure man of a twice-born caste must bathe (in a river).
22	18	A Sûdra (who has eaten the food) of another Sûdra, while the latter was impure, must bathe (in a river) and drink Pañkagavya.
22	19	Wives and slaves in the direct order of the castes (i. e. who do not belong to a higher caste than their lord) remain impure as long as their lord.
22	20	If their lord is dead (or if they live apart from him, they remain impure) as long as (members of) their own caste.
22	21	If Sapindas of a higher caste (are born or have died) the period of impurity has for their lower caste relations the same duration as for members of the higher caste.
22	22	A Brâhmana (to whom) Sapindas of the Kshatriya, Vaisya, or Sûdra castes (have been born or have died) becomes pure within six nights, or three nights, or one night, respectively.
22	23	A Kshatriya (to whom Sapindas of the) Vaisya or Sûdra castes (have been born or have died) is purified within six and three nights, respectively.
22	24	A Vaisya (to whom Sapindas of the) Sûdra caste (have been born or have died) becomes pure within six nights.
22	25	In a number of nights equal to the number of months after conception, a woman is purified from an abortion.
22	26	The relatives of children that have died immediately after birth (before the cutting of the navel-string), and of still-born children, are purified at once.
22	27	(The relatives) of a child that has died before having teethed (are also purified) at once.
22	28	For him no ceremony with fire is performed, nor offering of water.
22	29	. For a child that has teethed but has not yet been shorn, purity is obtained in one day and night;
22	30	For a child that has been shorn but not initiated, in three nights;
22	31	From that time forward (i. e. for initiated persons) in the time that has been mentioned above
22	32	In regard to women, the marriage ceremony is (considered as their) initiation.
22	33	For married women there is no impurity for the relatives on the father's side.
22	34	If they happen to stay at their father's house during childbirth or if they die there, (their distant relatives are purified) in one night, and their parents (in three nights).
22	35	If, while the impurity, caused by a birth lasts,another impurity caused by childbirth intervenes, it ends when the former impurity terminates.
22	36	If it intervenes when one night (only of the period of impurity remains, the fresh impurity terminates) two days later.
22	37	If it intervenes when one watch (only of the last night remains, the impurity ends) three days later.
22	38	The same rule is observed if a relative dies during a period of impurity caused by the death (of another relative).
22	39	If a man, while staying in another country, hears of the birth or death (of a relative), he becomes purified after the lapse of the period still wanting (to the ten days).
22	40	if the period of impurity, but not a whole year, has elapsed, (he is purified in one night.)
22	41	After that time (he is purified) by a bath.
22	42	If his teacher or maternal grandfather has died, (he is purified) in three nights.
22	43	Likewise, if sons other than a son of the body have been born or have died, and if wives who had another husband before have been delivered of a child or have died.
22	44	(He becomes pure) in one day, if the wife or son of his teacher, or his Upâdhyâya (sub-teacher), or his maternal uncle, or his father-in-law, or a brother-in-law, or a fellow-student, or a pupil has died.
22	45	The impurity has the same duration (as in the cases last mentioned), if the king of that country in which he lives has died.
22	46	Likewise, if a man not his Sapinda has died at his house.
22	47	The relatives of those who have been killed by (falling from) a precipice, or by fire, or (have killed themselves by) fasting, or (have been killed by) water, in battle, by lightning, or by the king (on account of a crime committed by them), do not become impure;
22	48	Nor do kings (become impure) while engaged in the discharge of their ditties (such as the protection of their subjects, the trial of lawsuits, &c.)
22	49	Devotees fulfilling a vow (also do not become impure);
22	50	Nor do sacrificers engaged in a sacrificial ceremony;
22	51	Nor workmen (such as carpenters or others) while engaged in their work;
22	52	Nor those who perform the king's orders, if the king wishes them to be pure.
22	53	Nor (can impurity arise) during the installation of the monument of a deity, nor duringa marriage ceremony, if those ceremonies have actually begun;
22	54	Nor when the whole country is afflicted with a calamity;
22	55	Nor in times if great public distress (such as an epidemic or a famine).
22	56	Suicides and outcasts do not cause impurity or receive offerings of water.
22	57	On the death-day of an outcast a female slave of his must upset a pot with water with her feet, (saying, 'Drink thou this.')
22	58	He who cuts the rope by which (a suicide) has hung himself, becomes pure by performing the Taptakrikkhra ('hot penance').
22	59	So does he who has been (in any way) concerned with the funeral of a suicide;
22	60	And he who sheds tears for such.
22	61	He who sheds tears for any deceased person together with the relations of the latter (becomes pure) by a bath.
22	62	If he has done so, before the bones (of the deceased) had been collected, (he becomes pure) by bathing with his apparel.
22	63	If a member of a twice-born caste has followed the corpse of a dead Sûdra, he must go to a river, and having plunged into it, mutter the Aghamarshana three times, and then, after having emerged from it, mutter the Gâyatrî one thousand and eight times.
22	64	(If he has followed) the corpse of a dead member of a twice-born caste,  one hundred and eight times only.
22	65	If a Sûdra has followed the corpse of a member of a twice-born caste, he must bathe.
22	66	Members of any caste, who have come near to the smoke of a funeral pile, must bathe.
22	67	(Bathing is also ordained) after sexual intercourse, bad dreams (of having been mounted upon an ass, or the like), when blood has issued from the throat, and after having vomited or been purged;
22	68	Also, after tonsure of the head;
22	69	And after having touched one who has touched a corpse (a carrier of a corpse), or a woman in her courses, or a Kândâla (or other low-caste persons, such as Svapakas), or a sacrificial post;
22	70	And (after having touched) the corpse of a five-toed animal, except of those kinds that may be eaten, or their bones still moist with fat.
22	71	In all such ablutions he must not wear his (defiled) apparel without having washed it before.
22	72	A woman in her courses becomes pure after four days by bathing.
22	73	A woman in her courses having touched another woman in her courses, who belongs to a lower caste than she does, must not eat again till she is purified.
22	74	If she has (unawares) touched a woman of her own caste, or of a higher caste than her own, she becomes pure at once, after having taken a bath.
22	75	Having sneezed, having slept, having eaten,going to eat or to study, having drunk (water), having bathed, having spat, having put on his garment, having walked on the high road, having discharged urine or voided excrements, and having touched the bones no longer moist with fat of a five-toed animal, he must sip water;
22	76	Likewise, if he has talked to a Kândâla or to a Mlekkha (barbarian).
22	77	If the lower part of his body, below the navel, or one of his fore-arms, has been defiled by one of the impure excretions of the body, or by one of the spirituous liquors or of the intoxicating drinks (hereafter mentioned), he is purified by cleansing the limb in question with earth and water.
22	78	If another part of his body (above the navel) has been defiled, (he becomes pure by cleansing it) with earth and water, and by bathing.
22	79	If his mouth has been defiled (he becomes pure) by fasting, bathing, and drinking Pañkagavya;
22	80	Likewise, if his lip has been defiled.
22	81	Adeps, semen, blood, dandruff, urine, fæces, earwax, nail-parings, phlegm, tears, rheum, and sweat, are the twelve impure excretions of the body.
22	82	Distilled from sugar, or from the blossoms of the Madhûka. (Mâdhvi wine), or from flour: these three kinds of spirituous liquor have to be discerned; as one, so are all: none of them must be tasted by the twice-born.
22	83	Again, distilled from the blossoms of theMadhûka tree (Madhûka wine), from molasses, from the fruits of the Tanka (or Kapittha tree), of the jujube tree, of the Khargûra tree, or of the breadfruit tree, from wine-grapes, from Madhûka blossoms (Mâdhvîka wine), Maireya, and the sap of the cocoanut tree:
22	84	These ten intoxicating drinks are unclean for a Brâhmana; but a Kshatriya and a Vaisya commit no wrong in touching (or drinking) them.
22	85	A pupil having performed (on failure of other mourners) the funeral of his dead Guru, becomes pure after ten nights, like those (kinsmen) who carry out the dead.
22	86	A student does not infringe the rules of his order by carrying out, when dead, his teacher, or his sub-teacher, or his father, or his mother, or his Guru.
22	87	A student must not offer a libation of water to a deceased relative (excepting his parents) till the term of his studentship has expired; but if, after its expiration, he offers a libation of water, he becomes pure after three nights.
22	88	Sacred knowledge , religious austerities (see go), fire , holy food (Pañkagavya), earth , the mind, water , smearing , air  religious acts, the sun, and time (by the lapse of the ten days of impurity and the like) are purifiers of animate objects.
22	89	Of all pure things, pure food is pronounced the most excellent; for he who eats pure food only, is truly pure, not he who is only purified with earth and water.
22	90	By forgiveness of injuries the learned are purified; by liberality, those who have done forbidden acts; by muttering of prayers, those who have sinned in secret; by religious austerities, those who best know the Veda.
22	91	By water and earth is purified what should be purified (because it has been defiled); a river is purified by its current (carrying away all slime and mud); a woman, whose thoughts have been impure, by her menses,; and the chief among the twice-born (the Brâhmanas), by renouncing the world.
22	92	Bodies (when defiled) are purified by water; the mind is purified (from evil thoughts) by truth; the soul (is purified or freed from worldly vanity) by sacred learning and austerities; the understanding (when unable to resolve some doubt), by knowledge.
22	93	Thus the directions for purifying animate bodies have been declared to thee; hear now the rules for cleaning all sorts of inanimate objects.
23	1	What has been defiled by the impure excretions of the body, by spirits, or by intoxicating drinks, is impure in the highest degree.
23	2	All vessels made of iron (or of other metals or of composition metals such as bell-metal and the like), which are impure in the highest degree, become pure by exposure to the fire.
23	3	Things made of gems or stones or water-shells, (such as conch-shells or mother-of-pearl, become pure) by digging them into the earth for seven days.
23	4	Things made of horns (of rhinoceroses or other animals), or of teeth (of elephants or other animals), or of bone (of tortoises or other animals, become pure) by planing them.
23	5	Vessels made of wood or earthenware must be thrown away.
23	6	Of a garment, which has been defiled in the highest degree, let him cut off that part which, having been washed, is changed in colour.
23	7	Objects made of gold, silver, water-shells, or gems, when (they are only defiled by leavings of food, and the like, and) not smeared (with greasy substances), are cleansed with water.
23	8	So are stone cups and vessels used at Soma-sacrifices (when not smeared).
23	9	Sacrificial pots, ordinary wooden ladles, and wooden ladles with two collateral excavations (used for pouring clarified butter on a sacrificial fire) are cleansed with hot water (when not smeared).
23	10	Vessels used for oblations (of butter, fruits, and the like are cleansed) by rubbing them with the hand (with blades of Kusa grass) at the time of the sacrifice.
23	11	Sword-shaped pieces of wood for stirring the boiled rice, winnowing baskets, implements used for preparing grain, pestles and mortars (are cleansed) by sprinkling water over them.
23	12	So are beds, vehicles, and seats (when defiled even by the touch of a Sûdra).
23	13	Likewise, a large quantity (of anything).
23	14	Grain, skins (of antelopes, &c.), ropes, woven cloth, (fans and the like) made of bamboo, thread, cotton, and clothes (which have only just come from the manufactory, or which are dyed with saffron and will not admit of washing for that reason, are cleansed in the same way, when there is a large quantity of them);
23	15	Also, pot-herbs, roots, fruits, and flowers;
23	16	Likewise, grass, firewood, dry cow-dung (used as fuel), and leaves (of the Madhûka, Palâsa, or other trees).
23	17	The same (when smeared with excrements and the like, are cleansed) by washing
23	18	And so , when there is only a small quantity of them;
23	19	Silk and wool, with saline earths;
23	20	(Blankets or plaids) made of the hair of the mountain-goat, with the fruits of the soap plant;
23	21	Clothes made of the bark of trees, with Bèl fruit;
23	22	Linen cloth, with white sesamum;
23	23	Likewise, things made of horns, bone, or teeth;
23	24	(Rugs or covers) made of deer's hair, with lotus-seeds;
23	25	Vessels of copper, bell-metal, tin, and lead, with acidulated water;
23	26	Vessels of white copper and iron, with ashes;
23	27	Wooden articles, by planing;
23	28	Vessels made of fruits (such as cocoa-nuts, bottle-gourds, and Be] fruits), by (rubbing them with) cows' hair.
23	29	Many things in a heap, by sprinkling water over them;
23	30	Liquids (such as clarified butter, milk, &c.), by straining them;
23	31	Lumps of sugar and other preparations from the sugar-cane, stored up in large quantities (exceeding a Drona) and kept in one's own house, by water and fire;
23	32	All sorts of salt, in the same manner;
23	33	Earthern vessels (if smeared with excrements and the like), by a second burning;
23	34	Images of gods (if smeared), by cleansing them in the same way as the material (of which they are made is generally cleansed), and then installing them anew (in their former place).
23	35	Of undressed grain let him remove so much only as has been defiled, and the remainder let him pound in a mortar and wash.
23	36	A quantity of prepared grain not exceeding a Drona is not spoiled by being defiled (by dogs, crows, and other unclean animals).
23	37	He must throw away thus much of it only as has been defiled, and must sprinkle over the remainder water, into which a piece of gold has been dropped, and over which the Gâyatrî has been pronounced, and must hold it tip before a goat (or before a horse) and before the fire.animals whose flesh may be eaten), has died, or which has been defiled in the highest degree, he must take out all the waters and dry up the remainder with a cloth.
23	45	If it is a well constructed with burnt bricks (or stones,) he must light a fire and afterwards throw Pañkagavya into it, when fresh water is coming forth.
23	46	For small reservoirs of water and for ponds the same mode of purification has been prescribed as for wells, O Earth; but large tanks (excepting Tîrthas) are not defiled (by dead animals, &c.)
23	47	The gods have declared, as peculiar to Brâhmanas, three causes effecting purity: if an (existing) impurity has not been perceived by them; if they, sprinkle the object (supposed to be impure) with water; and if they commend it, in doubtful cases, with their speech, (saying, 'This or that shall be pure.')
23	48	The hand of a (cook or other) artizan, things exposed for sale in a shop (though they may, have passed through the hands of many customers), food given to a Brâhmana (by other Brâhmanas, or by, Kshatriyas, &c., but not by Sûdras), and all manufactories or mines (of sugar, salt, and the like, but not distilleries of spirituous liquor), are always pure.
23	49	The mouth of a woman is always pure (for the purpose of a kiss); a bird is pure on the fall of fruit (which he has pecked); a sucking calf (or child), on the flowing of the milk; a dog, on his catching the deer.
23	50	Flesh of an animal which has been killed by dogs is pronounced pure; and so is that of ananimal slain by other carnivorous creatures (such as tigers) or by huntsmen such as Kandâlas (Svapakas, Kshattris, or other low-caste men).
23	51	The cavities above the navel must be considered as pure; those below it are impure; and so are all excretions that fall from the body.
23	52	Flies, saliva dropping from the mouth, a shadow, a cow, an elephant, a horse, sun-beams, dust, the earth, air, fire, and a cat are always pure.
23	53	Such drops as fall from the mouth of a man upon any part of his body do not render it impure, nor do hairs of the beard that enter his mouth, nor remnants of his food adhering to his teeth.
23	54	Drops which trickle on the feet of a man holding water for others to sip it, are considered as equal to waters springing from the earth: by them he is not soiled.
23	55	He who is anyhow touched by anything impure, while holding things in his hands, is purified by sipping water, without laying the things on the ground.
23	56	A house is purified by scouring it with a broom and plastering the ground with cow-dung, and a manuscript or book by sprinkling water over it. Land is cleansed by scouring, by plastering it with cow-dung,
23	57	By sprinkling, by scraping, by burning, or by letting cows (or goats) pass (a day and a night) on it. Cows are auspicious purifiers, upon cows depend the worlds,
23	58	Cows alone make sacrificial oblations possible (by producing sacrificial butter), cows take away every sin. The urine of cows, their dung, clarified butter, milk, sour milk, and Gorokanâ:
23	59	Those six excellent (productions) of a cow are always propitious. Drops of water falling from the horns of a cow are productive of religious merit, and have the power to expiate all sins (of those who bathe in, or rub themselves with, them).
23	60	Scratching the back of a cow destroys all guilt, and giving her to eat procures exaltation in heaven.
23	61	In the urine of cows dwells the Ganges, prosperity (dwells) in the dust (rising from their couch), good fortune in cow-dung, and virtue in saluting them. Therefore should they be constantly saluted.
24	1	Now a Brâhmana may take four wives in the direct order of the (four) castes;
24	2	A Kshatriya, three;
24	3	A Vaisya, two;
24	4	A Sûdra, one only.
24	5	Among these (wives), if a man marries one of his own caste, their hands shall be joined.
24	6	In marriages with women of a different class, a Kshatriya bride must hold an arrow in her hand;
24	7	A Vaisya bride,. a whip;
24	8	A Sûdra bride, the skirt of a mantle.
24	9	No one should marry a woman belonging to the same Gotra, or descended from the same Rishi ancestors, or from the same Pravaras.
24	10	Nor (should he marry) one descended from his maternal ancestors within the fifth, or from his paternal ancestors within the seventh degree;
24	11	Nor one of a low family (such as an agriculturer's, or an attendant of the king's family);
24	12	Nor one diseased;
24	13	Nor one with a limb too much (as e. g. having six fingers);
24	14	Nor one with a limb too little;
24	15	Nor one whose hair is decidedly red;
24	16	Nor one talking idly.
24	17	There are eight forms of marriage
24	18	The Brâhma, Daiva, Ârsha, Prâgâpatya, Gândharva, Âsura, Râkshasa, and Paisâka forms.
24	19	The gift of a damsel to a fit bridegroom, who has been invited, is called a Brâhma marriage.
24	20	If she is given to a Ritvig (priest), while he is officiating at a sacrifice, it is called a Daiva marriage.
24	21	If (the giver of the bride) receives a pair of kine in return, a is called an Ârsha marriage.
24	22	(If she is given to a suitor) by his demand, it is called a Prâgâpatya marriage.
24	23	A union between two lovers, without the consent of mother and father, is called a Gândharva marriage.
24	24	If the damsel is sold (to the bridegroom), it is called an Âsura marriage.
24	25	If he seizes her forcibly, it is called a Râkshasa marriage.
24	26	If he embraces her in her sleep, or while she is unconscious, it is called a Paisâka marriage.
24	27	Among those (eight forms of marriage), the four first forms are legitimate (for a Brâhmana);
24	28	And so is the Gândharva form for a Kshatriya.
24	29	A son procreated in a Brâhma marriage redeems (or sends into the heavenly abodes hereafter mentioned) twenty-one men (viz. ten ancestors, ten descendants, and him who gave the damsel in marriage).
24	30	A son procreated in a Daiva marriage, fourteen;
24	31	A son procreated in an Ârsha marriage, seven;
24	32	A son procreated in a Prâgâpatya marriage, four.
24	33	He who gives a damsel in marriage according to the Brâhma rite, brings her into the world of Brahman (after her death, and enters that world himself).
24	34	(He who gives her in marriage) according to the Daiva rite, (brings her) into Svarga (or heaven, and enters Svarga himself).
24	35	(He who gives her in marriage) according to the Ârsha rite, (brings her) into the world of Vishnu (and enters that world himself).
24	36	(He who gives her in marriage) according to the Prâgâpatya rite, (brings her) into the world of the gods (and enters that world himself).
24	37	(He who gives her in marriage) according to the Gândharva rite, will go to the world of Gandharvas.
24	38	A father, a paternal grandfather, a brother, a kinsman, a maternal grandfather, and the mother (are the persons) by whom a girl may be given in marriage.
24	39	On failure of the preceding one (it devolves upon) the next in order (to give her in marriage), in case he is able.
24	40	When she has allowed three monthly periods to pass (without being married), let her choose a husband for herself; three monthly periods having passed, she has in every case full power to dispose of herself (as she thinks best).
24	41	A damsel whose menses begin to appear (while she is living) at her father's house, before she has been betrothed to a man, has to be considered as a degraded woman: by taking her (without the consent of her kinsmen) a man commits no wrong.
25	1	Now the duties of a woman (are as follows):
25	2	To live in harmony with her husband;
25	3	To show reverence (by embracing their feet and such-like attentions) to her mother-in-law, father-in-law, to Gurus (such as elders), to divinities, and to guests;
25	4	To keep household articles (such as the winnowing basket and the rest) in good array;
25	5	To maintain saving habits;
25	6	To be careful with her (pestle and mortar and other) domestic utensils;
25	7	Not to practise incantations with roots (or other kinds of witchcraft);
25	8	To observe auspicious customs;
25	9	Not to decorate herself with ornaments (or to partake of amusements) while her husband is absent from home;
25	10	Not to resort to the houses of strangers (during the absence of her husband);
25	11	Not to stand near the doorway or by the windows (of her house);
25	12	Not to act by herself in any matter;
25	13	To remain subject, in her infancy, to her father; in her youth, to her husband; and in her old age, to her sons.
25	14	After the death of her husband, to preserve her chastity, or to ascend the pile after him.
25	15	No sacrifice, no penance, and no fasting is allowed to women apart from their husbands; to pay obedience to her lord is the only means for a woman to obtain bliss in heaven.
25	16	A woman who keeps a fast or performs a penance in the lifetime of her lord, deprives her husband of his life, and will go to hell.
25	17	A good wife, who perseveres in a chaste life after the death of her lord, will go to heaven like (perpetual) students, even though she has no son.
26	1	If a man has several wives of his own caste,he shall perform his religious duties together with the eldest (or first-married) wife.
26	2	(If he has several) wives of divers castes (he shall perform them) even with the youngest wife if she is of the same caste as himself.
26	3	On failure of a wife of his own caste (he shall perform them) with one belonging to the caste next below his own; so also in cases of distress (i.e. when the wife who is equal in caste to him happens to be absent, or when she has met with a calamity);
26	4	But no twice-born man ever with a Sûdra wife.
26	5	A union of a twice-born man with a Sûdra wife can never produce religious merit; it is from carnal desire only that he marries her, being blinded by lust.
26	6	Men of the three first castes, who through folly marry a woman of the lowest caste, quickly degrade their families and progeny to the state of Sûdras.
26	7	, If his oblations to the gods and manes and (his hospitable attentions) to guests are offered principally through her hands, the gods and manes (and the guests) will not eat such offerings, and he will not go to heaven.
27	1	The Nishekakarman (ceremony of impregnation)must be performed when the season fit for procreating children distinctly appears (for the first time).
27	2	The Pumsavana (ceremony to cause the birth of a male) must be performed before the embryo begins to move.
27	3	The Sîmantonnayana (ceremony of parting the hair) should take place in the sixth or eighth month (of pregnancy).
27	4	The Gâtakarman (birth-ceremony) should take place on the birth of the child.
27	5	The Nâmadheya (naming-rite) must be performed as soon as the term of impurity (caused by the birth of the child) is over.
27	6	(The name to be chosen should be) auspicious in the case of a Brâhmana;
27	7	Indicating power in the case of a Kshatriya;
27	8	Indicating wealth in the case of a Vaisya;
27	9	Indicating contempt in the case of a Sûdra.
27	10	The Âdityadarsana, (ceremony of taking the child out to see the sun) should take place in the fourth month (after birth).
27	11	The Annaprâsana (ceremony of first feeding) should take place in the sixth month.
27	12	The Kûdâkarana '(tonsure rite) should take place in the third year .
27	13	For female children the same ceremonies, (beginning with the birth ceremony, should be performed, but) without Mantras.
27	14	The marriage ceremony only has to be performed with Mantras for them.
27	15	The initiation of Brâhmanas (should take plate) in the eighth year after conception;
27	16	Of Kshatriyas, in the eleventh year after conception;
27	17	Of Vaisyas,, in the twelfth year after conception;
27	18	Their girdles should be made of Muñga grass, a bow-string, and Balbaga (coarse grass) respectively.
27	19	Their sacrificial strings and their garments should be made of cotton, hemp, and wool respectively.
27	20	The skins (which they wear) should be those of a black antelope, of a tiger, and of a he-goat respectively.
27	21	Their staves should be made of Palâsa, Khadira, and Udumbara wood respectively.
27	22	Their staves should be of such a length as to reach the hair, the forehead, and the nose respectively.
27	23	Or all (kinds of staves may be used for all castes indiscriminately).
27	24	And they should not be crooked, nor should the bark be stripped off.
27	25	In begging alms, they should put in the word 'Lady' at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end of their request (according to their caste).
27	26	The ceremony of initiation must not be delayed beyond the sixteenth year in the case of a Brâhmana; beyond the twenty-second, in the case of a Kshatriya; and beyond the twenty-fourth, in the case of a Vaisya.
27	27	After that, the youths belonging to any of those three castes, who have not been initiated at the proper time, are excluded from initiation, and contemned by the twice-born, and are called Vrâtyas.
27	28	That skin, that cord, that girdle, that staff, and that garment which has been given to any one (on his initiation), that he must for ever wear when performing any religious observance.
27	29	His girdle, his skin, his staff, his string, and his ewer he must throw into the water when broken (or spoiled by use), and receive others consecrated with Mantras.
28	1	Now students shall dwell at their Guru's (spiritual teacher's) house.
28	2	They shall recite their morning and evening prayers.
28	3	(A student) shall mutter the morning prayer standing, and the evening prayer sitting.
28	4	He shall perform twice a day (in the mornings and evenings) the religious acts of sprinkling the ground (round the altar) and of putting fuel on the fire.
28	5	He must plunge into the waters like a stick.
28	6	Let him study when called (by his teacher).
28	7	He shall act so as to please his Guru (spiritual teacher) and to be serviceable to him.
28	8	He shall wear his girdle, his staff, his skin, and his sacrificial string.
28	9	He shall go begging at the houses of virtuous persons, excepting those of his Guru's (and of his own) relatives.
28	10	He may eat (every morning and evening) some of the food collected by begging, after having received permission to do so from his Guru.
28	11	He must avoid Srâddhas, factitious salt, food turned sour, stale food, dancing, singing, women, honey, meat, ointments, remnants of the food (of other persons than his teacher), the killing of living beings, and rude speeches.
28	12	. He must occupy a low couch.
28	13	He must rise before his Guru and go to rest after him.
28	14	He must salute his Guru, after having performed his morning devotion.
28	15	Let him embrace his feet with crossed hands.
28	16	The right foot with his right hand, and the left foot with his left.
28	17	After the salutation (abhivâdaye, 'I salute') he must mention his own name and add the word 'bhos' (Venerable Sir) at the end of his address.
28	18	He must not speak to his Guru while he is himself standing, or sitting, or lying, or eating, or averting his face.
28	19	And let him speak, if his teacher sits, standing up; if he walks, advancing towards him; if he is coming near, meeting him; if he runs, running after him;
28	20	If his face is averted, turning round so as to face him;
28	21	If he is at some distance, approaching him;
28	22	If he is in a reclining position, bending to him;
28	23	Let him not sit in a careless attitude (such as e. g. having a cloth tied round his legs and knees, while sitting on his hams) before the eyes of his teacher,
28	24	Neither must he pronounce his mere name (without adding to it the word Srî or a similar term at the beginning).
28	25	He must not mimic his gait, his manner, his speech, and so on.
28	26	Where his Guru is censured or foully belied, there let him not stay.
28	27	Nor must he sit on the same seat with him,
28	28	Unless it be on a rock, on a wooden bench, in a boat, or in a carriage.
28	29	If his teacher's teacher is near, let him behave towards him as if he were his own teacher.
28	30	He must nor salute his own Gurus without his teacher's leave.
28	31	Let him behave towards the son of his teacher, who teaches him the Veda, as towards his teacher, even though he be younger or of an equal age with himself;
28	32	But he must not wash his feet,
28	33	Nor eat the leaving of his food.
28	34	Thus let him acquire by heart one Veda, or two Vedas, or (all) the Vedas.
28	35	Thereupon, the Vedângas (that treating of phonetics and the rest).
28	36	He who, not having studied the Veda, applies himself to another study, will degrade himself, and his progeny with him, to the state of a Sûdra.
28	37	From the mother is the first birth; the second, from the girding with the sacrificial string.
28	38	In the latter, the Sâvitrî hymn is his mother, and the teacher his father.
28	39	It is this which entitles members of the three higher castes to the designation of 'the twice-born.'
28	40	Previous to his being girded with the sacrificial string, a member of these castes is similar to a Sûdra (and not allowed to study the Veda).
28	41	A student shall shave all his hair, or wear it tied in one lock.
28	42	After having mastered the Veda, let him take leave of his teacher and bathe, after having presented, him with a gift.
28	43	Or let him spend the remainder of his life at his teacher's house.
28	44	If, while he is living there, his teacher should die, let him behave to his teacher's son as towards his teacher himself;
28	45	Or towards one of his wives, who is equal to him in caste.
28	46	On failure of such, let him pay homage to the fire, and live as a perpetual student.
28	47	A Brâhmana who passes thus without tiring (of the discharge of his duties) the time of his studentship will attain to the most exalted heavenly abode (that of Brahman) after his death, and will not be born again in this world.
28	48	A voluntary effusion of the semen by a twice-born youth (in sexual intercourse with a woman), during the period of his studentship, has been pronounced a transgression of the rule prescribed for students by expounders of the Vedas well acquainted with the system of duties.
28	49	Having loaded himself with that crime, be must go begging to seven houses, clothed only with the skin of an ass, and proclaiming his deed.
28	50	Eating once a day only a meal consisting of the alms obtained at those (houses), and bathing at the three Savanas (dawn, noon, and evening), he will be absolved from guilt at the end of the year.
28	51	After an involuntary effusion of the semen during sleep, a twice-born student must bathe (on the next morning), worship the sun (by offerings of perfumes and the like), and mutter three times the Mantra, 'Again shall my strength return to me.'
28	52	He who for seven days omits to collect alms and to kindle the sacred fire, must perform the penance of an Avakîrnin (breaker of his vow), provided that he has not been prevented from the discharge of his duties by an illness.
28	53	If the sun should rise or set while a student is purposely indulging in sleep, ignoring (the precepts of law), he must fast for a day, muttering (the Gâyatrî one thousand and eight times).
29	1	He who having initiated a youth and instructed him in the Vratas, teaches him (one branch of) the Veda (together with its Angas, such as that relating to phonetics, and the rest) is called Âkârya (teacher). Taitt. Ârany. I,

29	1	The Vratas of a student are certain observances to be kept by him before he is admitted to the regular course of study of the Veda, and again before he is allowed to proceed to the study of the Mahânâmnî verses and to the other higher stages of Vedic learning. See, particularly, Sânkh. II,
29	11	,
29	12	, with Dr. Oldenberg's note .]
29	2	He who teaches him (after he has been initiated by another) either (an entire branch of the Veda) in consideration of a fee, or part of a Veda (without taking a fee), is called Upâdhyâya (sub-teacher).
29	3	He who performs sacrifices (whether based upon Sruti or upon Smriti) is called Ritvig (officiating priest).
29	4	He must not engage a priest for the performance of sacrifices without having ascertained (his descent, character, and conduct).
29	5	Neither must he admit to his teaching (one whom he does not know).
29	6	And he must not initiate such a one.
29	7	If one answers improperly, or the other asks improperly, that one (or both) will perish or incur hatred.
29	8	If by instructing a pupil neither religious merit nor wealth are acquired, and if no sufficient attention is to be obtained from him (for his teacher's words), in such soil divine knowledge must not be sown: it would perish like fine seed in barren soil.
29	9	The deity of sacred knowledge approached a Brâhmana (and said to him), 'Preserve me, I am thy treasure, reveal me not to a scorner, nor to a wicked man, nor to one of uncontrolled passions: thus I shall be strong
29	10	'Reveal me to him, as to a keeper of thy gem, O Brâhmana, whom thou shalt know to be pure, attentive, possessed of a good memory, and chaste, who will not grieve thee, nor revile thee.'
30	1	After having performed the Upâkarman ceremony on the full moon of the month Srâvana, or of the month Bhâdra, the student must (pass over the two next days without studying, and then) study for four months and a half.
30	2	After that, the teacher must perform out of town the ceremony of Utsarga for those students (that have acted up to this injunction); but not for those who have failed to perform the ceremony of Upâkarman.
30	3	During the period (subsequent upon the ceremony of Upâkarman and) intermediate between it and the ceremony of Utsarga, the student must read the Vedângas.
30	4	He must interrupt his study for a day and a night on the fourteenth and eighth days of a month.
30	5	(He must interrupt his study for the next dayand night) after a season of the year has begun, (and for three nights) after an eclipse of the moon.
30	6	(He must not study for a day and a night) when Indra's flag is hoisted or taken down.
30	7	(He must not study) when a strong wind is going,
30	8	(He must not study for three days) when rain, lightning, and thunder happen out of season.
30	9	(He must not study till the same hour next day) in the case of an earthquake, of the fall of a meteor, and when the horizon is preternaturally red, as if on fire.
30	10	(He must not study) in a village in which a corpse lies;
30	11	Nor during a battle;
30	12	Nor while dogs are barking, jackals yelling. or asses braying;
30	13	Nor while the sound of a musical instrument is being, heard;
30	14	Nor while Sûdras or outcasts are near;
30	15	Nor in the vicinity of a temple, of a burial-ground, of a place where four ways meet, or of a high road;
30	16	Nor while immersed in water;
30	17	Nor with his foot placed upon a bench;
30	18	Nor while riding upon an elephant, a horse, or a camel, (or in a carriage drawn by any of those animals), or being borne in a boat, or in a carriage drawn by oxen;
30	19	Nor after having vomited;
30	20	Nor after having been purged;
30	21	Nor during an indigestion.
30	22	When a five-toed animal has passed between the teacher and the pupil (the latter must interrupt his study for a day and a night).
30	23	When a king or a learned Brâhmana (who has mastered one Veda), or a cow, or a Brâhmana (in general) has met with an accident (he must not study).
30	24	After the Upâkarman (he must not study for three days).
30	25	And after the Utsarga, (he must interrupt his study for as many days).
30	26	And (he must avoid to study) the hymns of the Rig-veda, or those of the Yagur-veda, while the Sâman melodies are being chanted.
30	27	Let him not lie down to sleep again when he has begun to study in the second half of the night.
30	28	Let him avoid studying at times when there ought to be an intermission of study, even though a question has been put to him (by his teacher);
30	29	Since to study on forbidden days neither benefits him in this nor in the other world.
30	30	To study on such days destroys the life of both teacher and pupil.
30	31	Therefore should a teacher, who wishes to obtain the world of Brahman, avoid improper days, and sow (on proper days) the seed of sacred knowledge on soil consisting of virtuous pupils.
30	32	At the beginning and at the end of the lecture let the pupil embrace his teacher's feet;
30	33	And let him pronounce the sacred syllable Om.
30	34	Now he who studies the hymns of the Rig-veda (regularly), feeds the manes with clarified butter.
30	35	He who studies the Yagus texts, (feeds them) with honey.
30	36	He who studies the Sâman melodies, (feeds them) with milk.
30	37	He who studies the Atharva-veda, (feeds them) with meat.
30	38	He who studies the Purânas, Itihâsas, Vedângas, and the Institutes of Sacred Law, feeds them with rice.
30	39	He who having collected sacred knowledge, gains his substance by it in this world, will derive no benefit from it in the world to come.
30	40	Neither will he (derive such benefit from it), who uses his knowledge in order to destroy the reputation of others (by defeating them in argument).
30	41	Let no one acquire sacred knowledge, without his teacher's permission, from another who is studying divine science.
30	42	. Acquiring it in that way constitutes theft of the Veda, and will bring him into hell.
30	43	Let (a student) never grieve that man from whom he has obtained worldly knowledge (relating to poetry, rhetoric, and the like subjects), sacred knowledge (relating to the Vedas and Vedângas), or knowledge of the Supreme Spirit.
30	44	Of the natural progenitor and the teacher who imparts the Veda to him, the giver of the Veda is the more venerable father; for it is the new existence acquired by his initiation in the Veda, which will last him both in this life and the next.
30	45	Let him consider as a merely human existence that which he owes to his father and mother uniting from carnal desire and to his being born from his mother's womb.
30	46	That existence which his teacher, who knows all the Vedas, effects for him through the prescribed rites of initiation with (his divine mother) the Gâyatrî, is a true existence; that existence is exempt from age and death.
30	47	He who fills his ears with holy truths, whofrees him from all pain (in this world and the next). and confers immortality (or final liberation) upon him, that man let the student consider as his (true) father and mother: gratefully acknowledging the debt he owes him, he must never grieve him.
31	1	A man has three Atigurus (or specially venerable superiors):
31	2	His father, his mother, and his spiritual teacher.
31	3	To them he must always pay obedience.
31	4	What they say, that he must do.
31	5	And he must do what is agreeable and serviceable to them.
31	6	Let him never do anything without their leave.
31	7	Those three are equal to the three Vedas (Rig-veda, Sâma-veda, and Yagur-veda), they are equal to the three gods (Brahman, Vishnu, and Siva), they are equal to the three worlds (of men, of gods, and of Brahman), they are equal to the three fires.
31	8	The father is the Gârhapatya (or household) fire, the mother is the Dakshina (or ceremonial) fire, and the spiritual teacher is the Âhavanîya (or sacrificial) fire.
31	9	He pays regard to all his duties, who pays regard to those three; he who shows no regard tothem, derives no benefit from any religious observance.
31	10	By honouring his mother, he gains the present world; by honouring his father, the world of gods; and by paying strict obedience to his spiritual teacher, the world of Brahman.
32	1	A king, a priest, a learned Brâhmana, one who stops wicked proceedings, an Upâdhyâya, a paternal uncle, a maternal grandfather, a maternal uncle, a father-in-law, an eldest brother, and the parents-in-law of a son or a daughter are equal to a teacher;
32	2	And so are their wives, who are equal in caste to them.
32	3	And their mother's sister, their father's sister, and I their eldest sister.
32	4	A father-in-law, a paternal uncle, a maternaluncle, and a priest he must honour by rising to meet and saluting them, even though they be younger than himself.
32	5	The wives of Gurus (superiors), who are of a lower class than their husbands (such as Kshatriya or Vaisya or Mûrdhâvasikta wives), shall be honoured by (rising to meet and) saluting them from far; but he must not embrace their feet.
32	6	He should avoid to rub and anoint the limbs of Guru's wives, or to anoint their eyes, or to arrange their hair, or to wash their feet, or to do other such services for them.
32	7	To the wife of another, even though he does not know her, he must either say 'sister' (if she is of equal age with himself), or 'daughter' (if she is younger than himself), or 'mother' (if she is older than himself).
32	8	Let him not say 'thou' to his Gurus (superiors).
32	9	If he has offended one of them (by saying 'thou' to him, or in some other manner), he must keep a fast and not eat again till the end of the day, after having obtained his forgiveness.
32	10	He must avoid to quarrel with his spiritual teacher and to argue with him (from emulation).
32	11	And he must not censure him;
32	12	Nor act so as to displease him.
32	13	(A pupil) must not embrace the feet of a Guru's young wife, if he has completed his twentieth year, or can distinguish virtue from vice.
32	14	But a young student may at pleasure prostrate himself before a young wife of his Guru, (stretching out both hands) as ordained , 'I, N. N. (ho! salute thee).'
32	15	On returning from a journey he shall (once) embrace the feet of the wives of his Gurus (superiors), and daily, salute them, remembering the practice of the virtuous.
32	16	Wealth, kindred, age, the performance of religious observances, and, fifthly, sacred knowledge are titles to respect; each subsequent one is superior to the one preceding in order.
32	17	A Brâhmana, though only ten years old, and a member of the kingly caste, though a hundred years old, must be considered as father and son; and of these two, the Brâhmana is the father.
32	18	The seniority of Brâhmanas is founded upon sacred knowledge; of Kshatriyas, upon valour in arms; of Vaisyas, upon grain and (other) wealth; of Sûdras, upon (priority of) birth.
33	1	Now man has three most dangerous enemies, called carnal desire, wrath, and greed.
33	2	They are specially dangerous to the order of householders, because they have (houses, wives, and other) property.
33	3	Man, being overcome by those (three enemies), commits crimes in the highest degree, high crimes, minor crimes, and crimes in the fourth degree;
33	4	Also crimes effecting loss of caste, crimes degrading to a mixed caste, and crimes rendering the perpetrator unworthy (to receive alms and the like);
33	5	And crimes causing defilement, and miscellaneous offences.
33	6	This is the threefold path to hell, destructive of self: carnal desire, wrath, and greed: therefore must a man shun those three vices.
34	1	Sexual connection with one's mother, or daughter, or daughter-in-law are crimes in the highest degree.
34	2	Such criminals in the highest degree should proceed into the flames; for there is not any other way to atone for their crime.
35	1	Killing a Brâhmana, drinking spirituous liquor,stealing the gold of a Brâhmana, and sexual connection with a Guru's wife are high crimes.
35	2	And social intercourse with such (criminals is also a high crime).
35	3	He who associates with an outcast is outcasted himself after a year;
35	4	And so is he who rides in the same carriage with him, or who eats in his company, or who sits on the same bench, or who lies on the same couch with him.
35	5	Sexual intercourse, intercourse in sacrificing, and intercourse by the mouth (with an outcast) entails immediate loss of caste.
35	6	Such mortal sinners are purified by a horse sacrifice and by visiting all Tîrthas (places of pilgrimage) on earth.
36	1	Killing a Kshatriya or Vaisya engaged in a sacrifice, or a woman in her courses, or a pregnant woman, or a woman (of the Brâhmana caste) who has bathed after temporary uncleanness, or an embryoof unknown sex, or one come for protection, are crimes equal to the crime of killing a Brâhmana.
36	2	Giving false evidence and killing a friend: these two crimes are equal to the drinking of spirituous liquor.
36	3	Appropriating to one's self land belonging to a Brâhmana or a deposit (belonging to a Brâhmana and not consisting of gold) are crimes equal to a theft of gold (belonging to a Brâhmana).
36	4	Sexual connection with the wife of a paternal uncle, of a maternal grandfather, of a maternal uncle, of a father-in-law, or of the king, are crimes equal to sexual connection with a Guru's wife;
36	5	And so is sexual intercourse with the father's or mother's sister and with one's own sister;
36	6	And sexual connection with the wife of a learned Brâhmana, or a priest, or an Upâdhyâya, or a friend;
36	7	And with a sister's female friend (or with one's own female friend), with a woman of one's own race, with a woman belonging to the Brâhmana caste, with a (Brâhmana) maiden (who is not yet betrothed to a man), with a low-caste woman, with a woman in her courses, with a woman come for protection,with a female ascetic, and with a woman entrusted to one's own care.
36	8	Such minor offenders become pure, like mortal sinners, by a horse-sacrifice and by visiting Tîrthas.
37	1	Setting one's self up by false statements (as by saying, 'I have done this,' or the like).
37	2	Making statements, which will reach the ears of the king, regarding a (minor) offence committed by some one;
37	3	Unjustly upbraiding a Guru (as by saying 'You have neglected such a household duty');
37	4	Reviling the Veda;
37	5	Forgetting the Veda texts, which one has studied;
37	6	(Abandoning) one's holy fire, or one's father, mother, son, or wife;
37	7	Eating the food of those whose food may not be eaten, or forbidden food;
37	8	Appropriating to one's self (grain, copper, or other) goods of another man (but not his gold);
37	9	Sexual intercourse with another man's wife;
37	10	Sacrificing for persons for whom it is forbidden to sacrifice (such as Sûdras, persons for whom the initiation has not been performed, and the like);
37	11	To live by a forbidden occupation (as, if a Brâhmana lives by the occupation of a Kshatriya, or of a Vaisya).
37	12	Receiving unlawful presents;
37	13	Killing a Kshatriya, or a Vaisya, or a Sûdra, or a cow;
37	14	Selling articles that ought not to be sold (such as salt, lac, or others);
37	15	For an elder brother to suffer his younger brother to marry before him;
37	16	For a younger brother to marry, though his elder brother is not yet married;
37	17	To give a girl in marriage to either of those two (categories of offenders);
37	18	Or to perform the nuptial ceremony for them;
37	19	To allow the proper time for the ceremony of initiation to pass without being initiated;
37	20	To teach the Veda for a reward (unless it be in an emergency);
37	21	To be taught by one who teaches the Veda for a reward (unless it be in an emergency);
37	22	To be employed (by the king's order) in the working of mines of any sort (whether gold mines, or silver mines, or others, or manufactories);
37	23	To make large (sharp) instruments (such as instruments for piercing an elephant's car);
37	24	Cutting trees, shrubs, creepers, long climbing plants (such as vines), or herbs;
37	25	Living by (prostituting) one's own wife;
37	26	Trying to overcome another by incantations (tending to kill him), or by forcible means;
37	27	Performing the act (of cooking) for one's own sole benefit;
37	28	Not to have kindled one's own sacred fire;
37	29	Omitting to pay one's debts to the gods, Rishis, and manes (or sacrificing, study of the Veda, and propagation of one's race);
37	30	Studying irreligious books;
37	31	Atheism;
37	32	Subsisting by a reprehensible art (such as dancing);
37	33	Intercourse with women who drink spirits;
37	34	Thus have the crimes in the fourth degree been enumerated.
37	35	Such criminals in the fourth degree shall perform the Kândrâyana or Parâka penances, or shall sacrifice a cow (as the case may require).
38	1	Causing (bodily) pain to a Brâhmana;
38	2	Smelling at things which ought not to be smelt (such as excrements), or at spirituous liquor;
38	3	Dishonest dealing;
38	4	Sexual connection with cattle;
38	5	And (sexual connection) with a man (or unnatural intercourse with a woman):
38	6	Such are the crimes effecting loss of caste.
38	7	He who has knowingly committed one of the acts effecting loss of caste shall perform the Sântapana penance; he who has done so unawares shall perform the Prâgâpatya penance.
39	1	Killing domestic or wild animals are crimes degrading to a mixed caste.
39	2	He who has committed a crime degrading to a mixed caste shall eat barley-gruel for a month (if he has committed it knowingly), or perform the penance Krikkhrâtikrikkhra (if he has committed it unawares).
40	1	Receiving anything from a (Mlekkha or other) despicable person (even though not as a present, but in the form of interest, &c.), traffic (even with articles that are not forbidden to sell), subsisting by money-lending (even without exceeding the legitimate rate of interest), telling lies (even though not in giving evidence), and serving a Sûdra (even though without doing servile acts for him) are crimes rendering unworthy to receive alms.
40	2	He who has committed a crime rendering unworthy to receive alms, is purified by the penance Taptakrikkhra (in case he committed it knowingly), or by the penance Sîtakrikkhra (in case he did it unawares), or by the penance Mahâsântapana (in case it was committed) repeatedly.
41	1	Killing birds, amphibious animals, and aquatic animals (such as fish);
41	2	And worms or insects;
41	3	Eating (nutmegs or other) plants similar to intoxicating drinks (in their effect upon the system):
41	4	Such are the crimes causing defilement.
41	5	The penance ordained for crimes causing defilement is the Taptakrikkhra penance (if they were committed unintentionally), or they shall be atoned for by the Krikkhrâtikrikkhra penance (if they were committed intentionally).
42	1	Miscellaneous crimes are those which have not been mentioned before.
42	2	Having committed one out of the number of miscellaneous crimes, a prudent man should always perform a penance, by the advice of a Brâhmana, after the higher or less degree of his guilt has been ascertained.
43	1	Now follow the hells. (They are called:)
43	2	Tâmisra (darkness);
43	3	Andhatâmisra (complete darkness);
43	4	Raurava (place of howling);
43	5	Mahâraurava (place of much howling);
43	6	Kâlasûtra (thread of time or death);
43	7	Mahânaraka (great hell);
43	8	Sañgîvana (restoring to life);
43	9	Avîki (waveless);
43	10	Tâpana (burning);
43	11	Sampratâpana (parching);
43	12	Samghâtaka, (pressing together)
43	13	Kâkola (ravens);
43	14	, Kudmala (bud);
43	15	Pûtimrittika (stinking clay);
43	16	Lohasankti (iron-spiked);
43	17	Rikîsha (frying-pan);
43	18	Vishamapanthâna (rough or uneven roads);
43	19	Kantakasâlmali (thorny Sâlmali trees);
43	20	Dîpanadî (flame river);
43	21	Asipattravana (sword-leaved forest);
43	22	Lohakâraka (iron fetters);
43	23	In each of those (hells) successively criminals in the highest degree, who have not performed the penance (prescribed for their crime), are tormented for the time of a Kalpa.
43	24	Mortal sinners (who have not done penance) for a Manvantara;
43	25	Minor offenders, for the same period;
43	26	Criminals in the fourth degree, for the period of a Katuryuga;
43	27	Those who have committed a crime effecting loss of caste, for a thousand years;
43	28	Those who have committed a crime degrading to a mixed caste, for the same period;
43	29	Those likewise who have committed a crime rendering unworthy to receive alms and the like.
43	30	And those who have committed a crime causing defilement;
43	31	Those who have committed one of the miscellaneous crimes, for a great number of years;
43	32	All sinners who have committed (one of those nine kinds of) crimes have to suffer terrible pangs, when they have departed life and entered upon the path of Yama.
43	33	Being dragged hither and thither (upon even and uneven roads), by the dire ministers of Yama, they are conducted (to hell by them), with menacing
43	34	(There) they are devoured by dogs and jackals, by hawks, crows, herons, cranes, and other (carnivorous animals), by (bears and other) animals having fire in their mouth, and by serpents and scorpions.
43	35	They are scorched by blazing fire, pierced by thorns, divided into parts by saws, and tormented by thirst.
43	36	They are agitated by hunger and by fearful troops of tigers, and faint away. at every step on account of the foul stenches proceeding from pus and from blood.
43	37	Casting wistful glances upon the food and drink of others, they receive blows from ministers (of Yama), whose faces are similar to those of crows, herons, cranes, and other horrid animals.
43	38	Here they are boiled in oil, and there pounded with pestles, or ground in iron or stone vessels.
43	39	In one place they (are made to) eat what has been vomited, or pus, or blood, or excrements, and in another place, meat of a hideous kind, smelling like pus.
43	40	Here, enveloped in terrible darkness, they are devoured by worms and (jackals and other) horrible animals having flames in their mouth.
43	41	There again they are tormented by frost, or have to step through unclean things (such as excrements), or the departed spirits eat one another, driven to distraction (by hunger).
43	42	In one place they are beaten with their deeds in a former existence, in another they are suspended (by trees and the like, with a rope), or shot with heaps of arrows, or cut in pieces.
43	43	In another place again, walking upon thorns, and their bodies being encircled by snakes, they are tormented with (grinding) machines, and dragged on by their knees.
43	44	Their backs, heads, and shoulders are fractured, the necks of these poor beings are not stouter than a needle, and their bodies, of a size fit for a hut only, are unable to bear torments.
43	45	Having thus been tormented (in the hells) and suffered most acute pain, the sinners have toendure further pangs in their migration through animal bodies.
44	1	Now after having suffered the torments inflicted in the hells, the evil-doers pass into animal bodies.
44	2	Criminals in the highest degree enter the bodies of all plants successively.
44	3	Mortal sinners enter the bodies of worms or insects.
44	4	Minor offenders enter the bodies of birds.
44	5	Criminals in the fourth degree enter the bodies of aquatic animals.
44	6	Those who have committed a crime effecting loss of caste, enter the bodies of amphibious animals.
44	7	Those who have committed a crime degrading to a mixed caste, enter the bodies of deer.
44	8	Those who have committed a crime rendering them unworthy to receive alms, enter the bodies of cattle.
44	9	Those who have committed a crime causing defilement, enter the bodies of (low-caste) men (such as Kandâlas), who may not be touched.
44	10	Those who have committed one of the miscellaneous crimes, enter the bodies of miscellaneous wild carnivorous animals (such as tigers).
44	11	One who has eaten the food of one whose food may not be eaten, or forbidden food, becomes a worm or insect.
44	12	A thief (of other property than gold), becomes a falcon.
44	13	One who has appropriated a broad passage, becomes a (serpent or other) animal living in holes.

44	25	One who has stolen sour milk, becomes a crane.
44	26	One who has stolen silk, becomes a partridge.
44	27	One who has stolen linen, becomes a frog.
44	28	One who has stolen cotton cloth, becomes a curlew.
44	29	One who has stolen a cow, becomes an iguana.
44	30	One who has stolen sugar, becomes a Vâlguda.
44	31	One who has stolen perfumes, becomes a musk-rat.

44	43	One who has stolen cattle, becomes a vulture.
44	44	He who has taken by force any property belonging to another, or eaten food not first presented to the gods (at the Vaisvadeva offering), inevitably enters the body of some beast
44	45	Women, who have committed similar thefts, receive the same ignominious punishment: they become females to those male animals.
45	1	Now after having undergone the torments inflicted in the hells, and having passed through the animal bodies, the sinners are born as human beings with (the following) marks (indicating their crime):
45	2	A criminal in the highest degree shall have leprosy;
45	3	A killer of a Brâhmana, pulmonary consumption;
45	4	A drinker of spirits, black teeth;
45	5	A stealer of gold (belonging to a Brâhmana), deformed nails;
45	6	A violator of his spiritual teacher's bed, a disease of the skin;
45	7	A calumniator, a stinking nose;
45	8	A malignant informer, stinking breath;
45	9	A stealer of grain, a limb too little;
45	10	One who steals by mixing (i. e. by taking good grain and replacing the same amount of bad grain in its stead), a limb too much;
45	11	A stealer of food, dyspepsia;
45	12	A stealer of words, dumbness;
45	13	A stealer of clothes, white leprosy;
45	14	A stealer of horses, lameness;
45	15	One who pronounces an execration against a god or a Brâhmana, dumbness;
45	16	A poisoner, a stammering tongue;
45	17	An incendiary, madness;
45	18	One disobedient to a Guru (father), the falling sickness;
45	19	The killer of a cow, blindness;
45	20	The stealer of a lamp, the same;
45	21	One who has extinguished a lamp, blindness with one eye;
45	22	A seller of tin, chowries, or lead, is born a dyer of cloth;
45	23	A seller of (horses or other) animals whose foot is not cloven, is born a hunter;
45	24	One who eats the food of a person born from adulterous intercourse, is born as a man who suffers his mouth to be abused;
45	25	A thief (of other property than gold), is born a bard;
45	26	A usurer becomes epileptic;
45	27	One who eats dainties alone, shall have rheumatics;
45	28	The breaker of a convention, a bald head;
45	29	The breaker of a vow of chastity, swelled legs;
45	30	One who deprives another of his subsistence, shall be poor;
45	31	One who injures another (without provocation), shall have an incurable illness.
45	32	Thus, according to their particular acts, are men born, marked by evil signs, sick, blind, humpbacked, halting, one-eyed;
45	33	Others as dwarfs, or deaf, or dumb, feeble-bodied (eunuchs, whitlows, and others). Therefore must penances be performed by all means.
46	1	Now follow the penances.
46	2	Let a man fast for three days;
46	3	And let him perform each day the three ablutions (at dawn, noon, and sunset);
46	4	And let him, at every ablution, plunge into the water three times;
46	5	And let him mutter the Aghamarshana three times, after having plunged into the water;
46	6	During day-time let him be standing;
46	7	At night let him continue in a sitting position;
46	8	At the close of the ceremony let him give a milch cow (to a Brâhmana).
46	9	Thus has the penance Aghamarshana been described.
46	10	Let a man for three days eat in the evening only; for other three days, in the morning only; for further three days, food (given to him) unsolicited; (and let him fast entirely for three days): that is the Prâgâpatya (the penance invented by Pragâpati).
46	11	Let him drink for three days hot water; for other three days, hot clarified butter; and for further three days, hot milk; and let him fast for three days: that is the Taptakrikkhra (hot penance).
46	12	Taking the same (liquids) cold is called the Sîtakrikkhra (cold penance).
46	13	The Krikkhrâtikrikkhra (the most difficult penance) consists in subsisting on milk only for twenty-one days.
46	14	Eating (nothing but) ground barley mixed with water for a whole month is called the Udakakrikkhra (water penance).
46	15	Eating nothing but lotus-fibres (for a whole month) is called the Mûlakrikkhra (root penance).
46	16	Eating nothing but Bèl fruit (for a whole month) is called the Srîphalakrikkhra (Bèl fruit penance).
46	17	Or (this penance is performed) by (eating) lotus-seeds.
46	18	A total fast for twelve days is called Parâka.
46	19	Subsisting for one day on the urine and fæces of a cow, milk, sour milk, butter, and waterin which Kusa grass has been boiled, and fasting the next day, is called Sântapana (the tormenting penance).
46	20	Swallowing (the same six things, viz.) cow-urine and the rest, each for one day, is called Mahâsântapana (the particularly tormenting penance).
46	21	Swallowing each for three days is called Atisântapana (the extremely tormenting penance).
46	22	Swallowing oil-cakes, foam of boiled rice, buttermilk, water, and ground barley (each for one day), with a fasting day between (every, two days), is called Tulâpurusha (a man's weight).
46	23	Drinking water boiled with Kusa grass, leaves of the Palâsa and Udumbara trees, of lotuses, of the Sankhapushpî plant, of the banyan tree, and of the Brahmasuvarkalâ plant, each (for one day), is called Parnakrikkhra (leaves penance).
46	24	Let a man perform all those penances after having shorn his hair and his beard, and let him bathe at morning, noon, and evening every day, lying on a low couch, and restraining his passions,
46	25	And let him (while engaged in performing them) avoid to converse with women, Sûdras, or outcasts, and let him constantly, to the best of his ability, mutter purifying Mantras and make oblations in the fire.
47	1	Now follows the Kândrâyana (lunar penance).
47	2	Let a man eat single mouthfuls (of food) unchanged in size;
47	3	And let him during the moon's increase add (successively) one mouthful (every day, so as to eat one mouthful on the first day of the moon's increase, two mouthfuls on the second day, and so on; fifteen mouthfuls on the day of full moon), and during the wane of the moon let him take off one mouthful (every day, so as to eat fourteen mouthfuls on the first day of the moon's wane, thirteen mouthfuls on the second, and one mouthful on the fourteenth day of the moon's wane), and on the day of new moon let him fast entirely: thus has the barley-shaped Kândrâyana been described.
47	4	Or the ant-shaped Kândrâyana (may be performed).
47	5	That Kândrâyana is called 'ant-shaped' in which the day of new moon is placed in the middle.
47	6	That one is, called 'barley-shaped' in which the day of full moon is placed in the middle.
47	7	If a man eats for a month eight mouthfuls a day, it is (the penance called) Yatikândrâyana (an hermit's Kândrâyana).
47	8	Eating (for a month) four mouthfuls each morning and evening is (the penance called) Sîsukândrâyana (a child's Kândrâyana).
47	9	Eating anyhow three hundred minus sixty mouthfuls a month is the penance called Sâmânyakândrâyâna (general Kândrâyana).
47	10	After having performed this penance, in a former age, the seven holy Rishis, Brahman, and Rudra acquired a splendid abode, O Earth.
48	1	Now if a man feels his conscience charged with some guilty act (such as performing a sacrifice for, or accepting a gift from, unworthy persons, or eating excrements) committed by himself (or if his conscience tells him that he has done more evil than good, or if he thinks himself less pure than others), let him boil a handful of barley-gruel for the sake of his own spiritual welfare.
48	2	Let him not make the (customary) Vaisvadeva offering after that.
48	3	Neither must he make the Bali offerings.
48	4	Let him consecrate with Mantras the barley, before it has been put to the fire, while it is being boiled, and after it has been boiled.
48	5	Let him watch the barley, while it is being boiled (muttering at the same time the following Mantra):
48	6	'Soma, who is the highest priest among priests (gods), leader among the wise, Rishi among bards, the falcon among rapacious birds, the Svadhiti tree among trees, trickles murmuring through the filter.'With these words he must fasten blades of Kusa grass (round the neck of the kettle).
48	7	The pulse having been boiled, he must pour it into another vessel and eat it.
48	8	Let him help himself to it, while muttering the Mantra, 'The gods, who have sprung up in the mind and satisfy the mind, who are gifted with great energy, and whose father is Daksha, shall protect and help us. To them be Namah (adoration), to them be Svâhâ (hail).'
48	9	Then, after having sipped water, let him seize the centre (of the vessel) and mutter the Mantra:
48	10	'Be satisfied in our stomach, O ye waters, and ye barley-corns, after having been bathed; they shall be salubrious to us, conferring bliss, causing health, divine, causing immortality, and increasers of Rita (truth and justice).'
48	11	One desirous of wisdom (must perform this rite) for three days;
48	12	A sinner, for six days.
48	13	Any of the mortal sinners (killers of a Brâhmana, stealers of gold, and the rest) becomes purified by swallowing it for seven days.
48	14	Swallowing it for twelve nights effaces even sins committed by an ancestor;
48	15	Swallowing it for a month, every sin (whether light or heavy, and whether committed by himself or by an ancestor).
48	16	And so does swallowing barley-corns dissolved in the excrements of a cow for twenty-one days (efface every sin).
48	17	'Thou art barley, thou the king of grains,thou water mixed with honey; the Rishis have proclaimed thee an expeller of every kind of guilt and an instrument of purification.
48	18	'You are clarified butter and honey, O ye barley-corns; you are water and ambrosia, O ye barley-corns. May you efface whatever sinful acts I have committed:
48	19	'Sins committed by words, by acts, and by evil thoughts. Avert distress and ill-fortune from me, O ye barley-corns.
48	20	'Purify food licked at by dogs or pigs, or defiled by leavings (of food), and (purify me from the stain) of disobedience towards mother and father, O ye barley-corns.
48	21	'Purify for me food given by a multitude of persons, the food of a harlot, or of a Sûdra, food offered at a Srâddha, food rendered impure by the birth of a child in the house, the food of a thief, and food offered at a Navasrâddha (or new Srâddha, which takes place on the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh day after a person's demise).
48	22	'Purify me, O ye barley-corns, from the sin of injuring a child or of causing (a punishment) to be inflicted on some one by the king, from theft of gold (or other high crimes), from the violation of a religious duty, from performing a sacrifice for an unworthy person, and from abusing a Brâhmana.'
49	1	After having fasted during the eleventh day of the bright half of the month Mârgasîrsha, let aman worship, on the twelfth day, the venerable Vâsudeva (Vishnu).
49	2	(He shall worship him) with flowers, incense, unguents, lamps, eatables (such as milk), and repasts given to Brâhmanas.
49	3	By performing this rite (on the twelfth day of the bright half of every month, from the month Mârgasîrsha to the month Kârttika) for one year, he is purified from every sin.
49	4	By performing it till he dies, he attains Svetadvîpa ('the white island,' the abode of Bhagavat).
49	5	By performing it for a year on each twelfth day of both halves of a month, he attains heaven.
49	6	By performing it (within the same intervals), till he dies, (he attains) the world of Vishnu.
49	7	The same (heavenly rewards are gained by him who performs this rite) on each fifteenth day (after having fasted during the fourteenth).
49	8	If he worships (according to the latter rite) Kesava (Vishnu) who has become one with Brahman, on the day of full moon, and Kesava absorbed in meditation, on the day of new moon, he will obtain a great reward.
49	9	If in a year on a day of full moon the moon and the planet Jupiter are seen together in the sky, it is called a great full moon.
49	10	Gifts, fasts, and the like are declared to be imperishable on that day. The same is the case if a conjunction with the asterism. Sravanâ falls on the twelfth day of the bright half (of any month).
50	1	Let a man make a hut of leaves in a forest and dwell in it;
50	2	And let him bathe (and perform his prayers) three times a day;
50	3	And let him collect alms, going from one village to another, and proclaiming his own deed;
50	4	And let him sleep upon grass:
50	5	This is called a Mahâvrata (great observance).
50	6	He who has killed a Brâhmana (unintentionally) must perform it for twelve years.
50	7	(He who has unintentionally killed) a Kshatriya or a Vaisya engaged in a sacrifice, for the same period.

50	13	He who has (unintentionally) killed a Vaisya (not engaged in a sacrifice), for half of that time (or for six years).
50	14	He who has (unintentionally) killed a (virtuous) Sûdra, for half of that time again (or for three years).
50	15	He who is performing any of those penances, must carry (on his stick) the skull of the person slain, like a flag.
50	16	Let a man serve cows for a month, his hair and beard having been shorn.
50	17	And let him sit down to rest when they rest;
50	18	And let him stand still when they stand still;
50	19	And let him give assistance to a cow that has met with an accident (such as getting into a slough, or falling into a pit).
50	20	And let him preserve them from (the attacks of lions and tigers and other) dangers.
50	21	Let him not seek shelter himself against cold (and hot winds) and similar dangers, without having previously protected the cows against them.
50	22	Let him wash himself with cow-urine (three times a day);
50	23	And let him subsist upon the (five) productions of a cow:
50	24	This is the Govrata (cow rite), which must be performed by him who has (unintentionally) killed a cow (belonging to a Kshatriya).

50	43	If he has (unintentionally) killed a bird (not mentioned before), he must eat at night only;
50	44	Or (if unable to do so), he must give a silver Mâsha.
50	45	If he has (unintentionally) killed an aquatic animal, he must fast (for a day and a night).
50	46	If he has killed a thousand (small) animals having bones, or an ox-load of animals that have no bones, he must perform the same penance as for killing a Sûdra.
50	47	But, if he has killed animals having bones, he must (moreover) give some trifle to a Brâhmana (for each animal which he has killed); if he has killed boneless animals, he becomes purified by one stopping of the breath.
50	48	For cutting (unawares?) trees yielding fruit (such as the bread-fruit or mango trees), shrubs, creeping or climbing plants, or plants yielding blossoms (such as the jasmine tree), he must mutter a Vedic text (the Gâyatrî) a hundred times.

51	43	A student, who partakes (unawares) of a Srâddha repast, must fast for three days.
51	44	And he must remain in water for a whole day (afterwards).
51	45	If he eats honey or meat (at any time), he must perform the Prâgâpatya penance.

51	58	For (unawares) eating dressed food (left by such), the Parâka penance is ordained.
51	59	Let no Brâhmana ever eat (the flesh of) beasts which has not been consecrated with Mantras; but if it has been consecrated with Mantras, he may eat it, following the eternal rule (laid down in the Veda).
51	60	As many hairs as the beast has, which he has slain in this world, for so many days will the killer of a beast for other purposes than a (Srauta or Smârta) sacrifice, suffer terrible pangs in this world and in the next.
51	61	It is for sacrifices that beasts have been created by the Self-existent (Brahman) himself. Sacrificing causes the whole universe to prosper; therefore is the slaughter (of beasts) for a sacrifice no slaughter.
51	62	The sin of him who kills deer for the sake of gain, is not so great (and visited less heavily) in the world to come, than the sin of him who eats meat which has not been offered to the gods.
51	63	Plants, cattle, trees, amphibious animals, and birds, which have been destroyed for the purposes of sacrifice, obtain exaltation in another existence (in which they are born as Gandharvas, or other beings of a high rank).
51	64	When honouring a guest, at a sacrifice, or when worshipping the manes, or the gods, a man may slay cattle, but not otherwise on any account.
51	65	That twice-born man who, knowing the exact truth (promulgated) in the Veda, slays cattle for the sacrifices (ordained in the Veda), will convey himself and the cattle (slain by him) to a blissful abode.
51	66	A self-controlled man of a twice-born caste, whether he be a householder, or be dwelling with his spiritual teacher, or in the forest, must never slay an animal in opposition to the precepts of the Veda, even in cases of distress.
51	67	That slaughter which is in accordance with the precepts of the Veda, and has been fixed for this world of movable and immovable creatures, should be considered as no slaughter at all; because it is from the Veda that law shines forth.
51	68	He who hurts animals that do not hurt any one, merely in order to afford pleasure to himself, will never obtain happiness, whether living or dead.
51	69	He who gives no living creature intentionally the pain of confining or killing (or hurting) it, from benevolence towards all (creatures), will enjoy everlasting happiness.
51	70	Whatever he thinks of, whatever he strives for, and whatever he desires in his heart, all that is easily obtained by him who does not injure any created being.
51	71	Meat cannot be obtained without injuring ananimal, and the murder of animals excludes the murderer from heaven, therefore must meat be avoided.
51	72	Reflecting upon the origin of flesh and upon the (sin of) hurting or confining animated creatures, he must abstain from animal food of any kind.
51	73	He who transgresses not the law and eats not flesh like a Pisâka, is beloved by men and remains free from disease.
51	74	He who gives his consent to the killing of an animal, he who cuts it up, he who kills it, the purchaser and the seller, he who prepares it, he who serves it up, and he who eats it, all these are denominated slaughterers of an animal.
51	75	There is no greater sinner than he who, without giving their share to the manes and to the gods, wants to increase his own flesh with the flesh of another creature.
51	76	Those two, he who performs a horse-sacrifice annually for a hundred years and he who does not eat meat, shall both obtain the same recompense for their virtue.
51	77	By eating (wild rice or other) sacred fruits or roots, and by living upon such grains as are the food of hermits, a man does not reap so high a reward as by avoiding meat
51	78	(An eater of flesh must say within himself), Me he (mâm sa) will eat in the next world, whoseflesh I am tasting here. This, say the learned, is the derivation of the word flesh (mâmsa).
52	1	He who has stolen the gold (of a Brâhmana), must bring a club to the king, proclaiming his deed.
52	2	Whether the king kills him with it, or dismisses him unhurt, he is purified.
52	3	Or (in case he committed the theft unawares), he must perform the Mahâvrata for twelve years.
52	4	He who appropriates (knowingly) a deposit, (must perform the same penance.)
52	5	He who steals (knowingly) grain or valuable objects, (or prepared food belonging to a Brâhmana,) (must perform) the Krikkhra for a year.
52	6	For stealing male or female slaves (not belonging to a Brâhmana, and for seizing) a well or pool (actually containing water), or a field, the Kândrâyana (penance must be performed).
52	7	(For stealing) articles of small value (such as tin or lead, not exceeding twenty-five Panas in value), the Sântapana (penance must be performed).
52	8	(For stealing) sweetmeats, (rice or other) food,(milk or other) drinks, a bed, a seat, flowers, roots, or fruit, drinking Pañkagavya (is ordained as penance).
52	9	(For stealing) grass, firewood, trees, rice in the husk, sugar, clothes, skins, or flesh, the thief must fast for three days.
52	10	(For stealing knowingly) precious stones, pearls or coral, copper, silver, iron, or white copper. he must eat grain separated from the husk for twelve days.
52	11	For stealing (unawares) cotton, silk, wool or other (stuffs), he must subsist for three days upon milk.
52	12	For stealing two-hoofed or one-hoofed animals, he must fast for three days.
52	13	For stealing birds, or perfumes, or medicinal herbs, or cords, or basket-work, he must fast for one day.
52	14	Though a thief may have restored to the owner the stolen property (either openly or) in some indirect manner, he must still perform a penance, in order to purify himself from guilt.
52	15	Whatever a man takes from others, unchecked (by the dictates of religion), of that will he be bereft in every future birth.
52	16	Because life, religious merit, and pleasure depend upon wealth, therefore let a man take care not to injure the wealth (of others by robbing them) by any means.
52	17	Among those two, he who injures animal life, and be who injures wealth, the one who injures wealth shall incur the heavier penalty.
53	1	One who has (unawares) had illicit sexual intercourse, must perform the Prâgâpatya penance for a year, according to the rule of the Mahâvrata, clad in a garment of bark, and living in a forest.
53	2	The same (penance is ordained) for sexual intercourse with the wife of another man (who belongs to his own caste, but is no Guru of his).
53	3	For intercourse with a cow, the Govrata (must be performed).
53	4	For intercourse with a man, for unnatural crimes with a woman, (for wasting his manhood) in the air, (for intercourse with a woman) in water, by day, or in a go-cart, he must bathe dressed in his clothes.
53	5	By intercourse (knowingly) with a Kandâla woman, he becomes her equal in caste.
53	6	For intercourse unawares with such, he must perform the Kândrâyana twice.
53	7	For intercourse (knowingly) with cattle (other) than cows) or with a public prostitute, (he must perform) the Prâgâpatya penance.
53	8	A woman who has committed adultery once,must perform that penance which has been prescribed for an adulterer.
53	9	That guilt which a Brâhmana incurs by intercourse with a Kandâla woman one night, he can only remove by subsisting upon alms, and constantly repeating (the Gâyatrî) for three years.
54	1	If a man associates with one guilty of a crime, he must perform the same penance as he.
54	2	A Brâhmana who has drunk water from a well in which a five-toed animal has perished, or which has been defiled in the highest degree, must fast for three days.
54	3	A Kshatriya (must fast) for two days (in the same case).
54	4	A Vaisya (must fast) for one day (and one night).
54	5	A Sûdra (must fast) for a night only.
54	6	And all (the former, but not a Sûdra) must drink Pañkagavya, when their penance has been completed.
54	7	If a Sûdra drinks Pañkagavya, or if a Brâhmana drinks spirituous liquor, they both go to the hell called Mahâraurava.
54	8	If a man has not connection with his wife in the natural season, unless it be on the days of the full and new moon, or because she is ill, he must fast for three days.
54	9	A false witness must perform the penance ordained for killing a Brâhmana.
54	10	He who has (unawares) voided excrements without water (being near), must bathe in his clothes, pronounce the 'great words,' and offer a burnt-oblation.
54	11	One who has been surprised asleep by the sun rising or setting, must bathe in his clothes and mutter the Gâyatrî one hundred -and eight times.
54	12	He who has been bitten by a dog, a jackal, a tame pig, an ass, an ape, a crow, or a public prostitute, shall approach a river and (standing in it, shall) stop his breath sixteen times.
54	13	One who forgets the Vedic texts which he has studied, or who forsakes the sacred fires, must subsist upon alms for a year, bathing at the tree Savanas  an ungrateful man, one who buys or sells with false weights, and one who deprives Brâhmanas of their livelihood (by robbing them of a grant made to them by the king or private persons, or by other bad practices), all those persons must subsist upon alms for a year.
54	16	An unmarried elder brother whose younger brother is married, a younger brother married before the elder, an unmarried elder sister whose younger sister is married, the relative who gives such a damsel in marriage, and the priest who officiates at such a marriage, must perform the Kândrâyana.
54	17	, He who sells living beings, land, religious merit (obtained by a sacrifice or otherwise), or Soma, must perform the Taptakrikkhra.
54	18	He who sells fresh ginger, (edible) plants (such as rice or barley), perfumes, flowers, fruits, roots, skins, canes, (winnowing baskets or fans and the like) made of split bamboo, chaff, potsherds, hair, ashes, bone, cow-milk or curds, oil-cakes, sesamum, or oil, must perform the Prâgâpatya.
54	19	He who sells the fruit of the Sleshmâtaka tree, lac, bees-wax, shells, mother-of-pearl, tin, lead, iron, copper, or, (sacrificial) vessels made of the horn of the rhinoceros, must perform the Kândrâyana.
54	20	He who sells dyed cloth, tin, preciousstones, perfumes, sugar, honey, liquids or condiments (other than sugar, salt, and the like), or wool, must fast for three days.
54	21	He who sells meat, salt, lac, or milk, must perform the Kândrâyana.
54	22	And all those persons  must be initiated a second time.
54	23	He who has been riding (voluntarily) upon a camel, or upon an ass, and he who has (purposely) bathed, or slept, or eaten, quite naked, must stop his breath three times.
54	24	By muttering attentively the Gâyatrî three thousand times, (by dwelling) upon the pasture of cows, (and) by subsisting on milk for a month, he becomes free from the sin of accepting unlawful presents.
54	25	He who has (knowingly) offered a sacrifice for an unworthy person (such as a low-caste person, or an outcast), he who has performed the funeral rites for a stranger, he who has practised magic rites (in order to destroy an enemy), and he who has performed a sacrifice of the kind called Ahîna, (all those persons) may rid themselves of theirsins by performing three Krikkhra (Prâgâpatya) penances.
54	26	Those twice-born men, by whom the Gâyatrî has not been repeated (and the other initiatory ceremonies performed), as the law directs, must be made to perform three (Prâgâpatya) penances and must be initiated according to custom.
54	27	Those twice-born men who are anxious to make an atonement for having committed an illegal act, or for having neglected the study of the Veda, must be made to perform the same penance.
54	28	Those Brâhmanas who have acquired property by base acts (such as living by the occupations of a lower caste, or accepting unlawful presents) become free from sin by relinquishing it, and by muttering (Veda texts) and practising austerities.
54	29	For omitting one of the regular acts enjoined in the revealed (and traditional) law, and for a breach of the rules laid down for a Snâtaka, a fast is ordained as atonement.
54	30	For attacking a Brâhmana (by raising a stick or a weapon against him), the Krikkhra (Prâgâpatya) penance must be performed; for striking him, the Atikrikkhra; and for fetching blood from him, the Krikkhrâtikrikkhra.
54	31	With sinners, who have not expiated their crime, let a man not transact business of any kind. But a man who knows the law must not blame (or shun) those who have expiated it.
54	32	Let him not, however, live (or have any intercourse) with those who have killed children, or with ungrateful persons, or with those who have slain one come for protection, or a woman, even though such sinners may have obtained their absolution, as directed by the law.
54	33	(An old man) who has passed his eightieth year, a youth under the age of sixteen, women, and sick persons have only to perform half of every penance.
54	34	In order to remove those sins for which no particular mode of expiation has been mentioned, penances must be prescribed, which shall be in accordance with the ability of the offender, and with the heaviness of his offence.
55	1	Now follow the penances for secret sins.
55	2	The killer of a Brâhmana is purified, if, having approached a river (and bathed in it), he restrains his breath sixteen times, and takes only one meal, consisting of food fit for offerings, each day, for a month.
55	3	At the end of this rite he must give a milch cow.
55	4	By performing the same rite and by muttering (while standing in the water) the Aghamarshana (instead of stopping his breath), a drinker of spirituous liquor becomes free from sin.
55	5	(By performing the same rite and) muttering the Gâyatrî one thousand and ten times (each day), a stealer of gold becomes free from guilt.
55	6	One who has connection with a Guru's wife (becomes free from sin) by fasting for three days and muttering the Purushasûkta and (at the same time) offering a burnt-oblation.
55	7	Even as the horse-sacrifice, the king of sacrifices, removes all sin, the hymn of Aghamarshana likewise removes all sin.
55	8	Let a twice-born man stop his breath, in order to rid himself of all sin; all sins committed by atwice-born man may be removed by repeated Prânâyâmas.
55	9	It is called a Prânâyâma, if a man, stopping the breath (which comes from the mouth and from the nostrils), recites the Gâyatrî three times, together with the Vyâhritis ('words'), with the sacred syllable Om, and with the (text called) Siras.
55	10	The lord of creatures (Brahman) has milked out from the three Vedas the letter A, the letter U, and the letter M (of which the sacred syllable Om is composed), and (the three sacred words) Bhûh, Bhuvah, Svah (earth, the atmosphere, and heaven).
55	11	The lord of creatures, the supreme deity, has also milked out from the three Vedas successively the three verses of the sacred stanza which begins with the word 'tad,' and is called Sâvitrî (or Gâyatrî).
55	12	By muttering, every morning and evening, that syllable and that stanza, preceded by the three 'words,' a Brâhmana will obtain that religious merit which the (study of the) Veda confers, just as if he had actually studied the Veda.
55	13	By repeating those three (Om, the 'words,' and the Gâyatrî every day) for a month out of the village, a thousand times, a twice-born man is purified even from a mortal sin, as a snake (is freed) from its withered skin.
55	14	Any member of the Brâhmana, Kshatriya, or Vaisya castes, who does not know those three texts,or fails to recite them in the proper season, meets with reproach among the virtuous.
55	15	The three imperishable 'great words,' preceded by the syllable Om, and the Gâyatrî consisting of three divisions, have to be recognised as the mouth (or beginning) of the Veda.
55	16	He who repeats that stanza (preceded by the syllable Om and the three 'words') carefully every day for three years, will be absorbed in the highest Brahman after death, move as freely as air, and become as pure as air.
55	17	The monosyllable (Om) is the highest Brahman, the stoppings of the breath are the best of austerities, but nothing is more exalted than the Gâyatrî; (declaring the) truth is better than silence.
55	18	All religious acts ordained in the Veda, (whether) consisting in burnt-oblations or sacrifices (or alms-giving or other pious observances), perish (after the merit obtained by them has been exhausted); but the syllable Om (akshara) must be known to be imperishable (akshara), as it is identical with Brahman, the lord of creatures.
55	19	The act of reciting (the syllable Om, the 'words,' and the Gâyatrî) is ten times better than the (Gyotishtoma or other) sacrifices prescribed (by the Veda); it is a hundred times better when muttered in a low voice; it is a thousand times better when repeated mentally only.
55	20	The four Pâkayagñas (small or domesticofferings), together with the sacrifices prescribed (in the Veda), though all united, are not equal to a sixteenth part of the sacrifice performed by reciting (those sacred prayers).
55	21	A Brâhmana may beyond doubt obtain final emancipation by solely repeating (those prayers), whether he perform any other religious observance or no; one who is benevolent towards all creatures (and does not slay them for sacrifices) is justly, called a Brâhmana (or one united to Brahman).
56	1	Now then follow the purifying Mantras from all the Vedas.
56	2	By muttering them, or reciting them at a burnt-oblation, the twice-born are purified from their sins. (They are as follows:)
56	3	The Aghamarshana;
56	4	The Devakrita;
56	5	The Suddhavatîs;
56	6	The Taratsamandîya;
56	7	The Kûshmândîs;
56	8	The Pâvamânîs;
56	9	The Durgâsâvitrî;
56	10	The Atishangas;
56	11	The Padastobhas;
56	12	The Vyâhriti Sâmans.;
56	13	The Bhârundas;
56	14	The Kandrasâman;
56	15	Thetwo Sâmans called Purushavrata;
56	16	The Ablinga;
56	17	The Bârhaspatya;
56	18	The Gosûkta;
56	19	The Âsvasûkta;
56	20	The two Sâmans called Kandrasûkta;
56	21	The Satarudriya;
56	22	The Atharvasiras;
56	23	The Trisuparna;
56	24	The Mahâvrata;
56	25	The Nârâyanîya;
56	26	And the Purushasûkta;;
56	27	The three Âgyadohas, the Rathantara, the Agnivrata, the Vâmadevya, and the Brihatsâman, properly chanted, purify man from sin; and if he wishes he may obtain through them recollection of his existence in a former life.
57	1	Now (the following persons) must be avoided:
57	2	Vrâtyas (i. e. those for whom the ceremony of initiation has not been performed)
57	3	Outcasts;
57	4	Descendants within the third degree' of an outcast mother or father, if they (or their outcast ancestors) have not been purified (by a penance).
57	5	(As a rule) the food of all such persons must not be eaten, nor gifts be accepted from them,.
57	6	He must avoid accepting repeated gifts from those whose presents must not be accepted.
57	7	By accepting such gifts, Brâhmanas lose their divine lustre.
57	8	And he who, not knowing the law regarding acceptance of gifts, accepts (illicit) gifts, sinks, to hell together with the giver.
57	9	He who, being worthy to receive gifts, does not accept them, obtains that world which is destined for the liberal-minded (after death).
57	10	Firewood, water, roots, fruits, protection, meat, honey, a bed, a seat, a house, flowers, sourmilk, and vegetables he must not disdain to accept when they are offered to him.
57	11	Even if an offender (but not a mortal sinner) has beckoned and offered alms to him, which had been brought previously for the purpose, the lord of creatures has declared that they may be accepted from him.
57	12	Neither will the manes eat (his funeral oblations offered to them) for fifteen years, nor will the fire convey his burnt-offerings (to the gods) if he rejects such alms.
57	13	If he wishes to provide for his (parents or other) Gurus or for (his wife or other) such persons as he is bound to maintain, or if he wants to worship the manes or the gods, he may accept gifts from any one; but he must not satisfy himself with them.
57	14	But even in those cases, and though he be worthy to receive presents, let him not accept them from a dissolute woman, from a eunuch, from an outcast, or from an enemy.
57	15	And if his parents are dead, or if he is living apart from them in a house of his own, he must never, while seeking to obtain food for himself, accept alms from any other persons but those who are of respectable descent (and belong to a twice-born caste).
57	16	One who ploughs the ground for half the crop (and gives the other half to the king or a private person, who is the owner), a friend of the family, a (house-)slave, a herdsman, a barber, andone who announces himself (with the words 'I am your slave'): the food of all such may be eaten, although they are Sûdras.
58	1	The property of householders is of three kinds:
58	2	White, mottled, and black.
58	3	By those obsequies which a man performs with white property, he causes (his departed ancestor) to be born again as a god.
58	4	By performing them with mottled property, he causes him to be born as a man.
58	5	By performing them with black property, he causes him to be born as an animal.
58	6	What has been acquired by the mode of livelihood of their own caste, by members of any caste, is called 'white.'
58	7	What has been acquired by the mode of livelihood of the caste next below in order to their own, is called 'mottled.'
58	8	What has been acquired by the mode of livelihood of a caste by two or more degrees lower than their own, is called 'black.'
58	9	What has been inherited, friendly gifts, andthe dowry of a wife, that is called white property, for members of any caste indiscriminately.
58	10	What has been acquired as a bribe, as a fee (for crossing a river and the like, or for a bride, &c.), or by the sale of forbidden articles (such as lac, or salt), or as a return for a benefit conferred, is denoted 'mottled wealth.'
58	11	What has been acquired by servile attendance, by gambling, by thieving, by begging, by deceit (as if a man says that he wants a present for another and takes it himself, or by forging gold or other metals), by robbery, or by fraud (as if a man shows one thing to a purchaser and delivers another to him instead), is called 'black property.'
58	12	Whatever a man may do (in this world) with anything (he has, whether white, mottled, or black property) he will get his reward accordingly; both in the next world and in this.
59	1	A householder must perform the Pâkayagñas(small or domestic offerings) in the fire kindled at the time of marriage.
59	2	He must offer the Agnihotra (or daily oblations of clarified butter) every morning and evening (in the Tretâ fires).
59	3	He must offer burnt-oblations to the gods (in case the Agnihotra cannot be performed).
59	4	Let him offer the two Darsapurnamâsas on the days of conjunction and opposition of the sunand moon.
59	5	Once in each half of the year, (at the two solstices, let him offer) the Pasubandha (animal sacrifice).
59	6	In autumn and summer let him offer the Âgrayana (oblation of first-fruits);
59	7	Or when rice and barley are ripening (in winter and spring).
59	8	He who has a sufficient supply of food for more than three years (shall perform the Soma-sacrifice).
59	9	(He shall perform) the Soma-sacrifice once a year (in spring).
59	10	If he has not wealth (sufficient to defray the expenses of the Pasubandha, Soma, Kâturmâsya, and other Srauta sacrifices), he shall perform the Ishti Vaisvânarî.
59	11	Let him not make an offering of food obtained as alms from a Sûdra.
59	12	If he has begged articles for a sacrifice (and obtained them), let him employ them all for that purpose (and never for himself).
59	13	Every evening and morning let him offer up the Vaisvadeva;
59	14	And let him give alms to an Ascetic (afterwards).
59	15	For giving alms and showing due honour to the recipient (by pouring water on his hands both before and afterwards) he obtains the same reward as for giving a cow.
59	16	If there is no ascetic (or other person worthy to receive alms), he must give a mouthful to cows;
59	17	Or he must cast it into fire.
59	18	If there is food in the house, he must not reject a mendicant, (who arrives) after he has taken his meal himself.
59	19	A householder has five places where animals are liable to be destroyed: his wooden mortar, his slab to grind wheat or condiments upon, his fireplace, his water-pot, and his broom.
59	20	For the sake of expiating offences committed (by ignorantly destroying life) in those places, he must perform the (five) sacrifices addressed to the Veda, to the gods, to all created beings (or 'to the goblins'), to the manes, and to men.
59	21	Privately reciting (and teaching) the Veda is the sacrifice addressed to the Veda.
59	22	The regular burnt-oblation (Vaisvadeva) is the sacrifice addressed to the gods.
59	23	The Pitritarpana (refreshing the manes with food and water) is the sacrifice addressed to the manes.
59	24	The Bali-offering is the sacrifice addressed to all creatures (or 'to the goblins').
59	25	The sacrifice addressed to men consists in honouring a guest.
59	26	He who does not give their share to these five, the gods, his guests, (his wife and children and others,) whom he is bound to maintain, his manes, and himself, is not alive, though he breathes.
59	27	These (three), the student, the hermit, and the ascetic, derive their existence from the order of householders; therefore must a householder not treat them with disdain, when they have arrived (at his house at the proper time for begging alms).
59	28	The householder offers sacrifices, the householder practises austerities, the householder distributes gifts; therefore is the order of householders, the first of all.
59	29	The Rishis, the manes, the gods, all creatures (dogs, &c.), and guests beg householders for support; therefore is the order of householders the best of all.
59	30	If a householder is intent upon pursuing the three objects of life (virtue, love, and wealth), upon constantly distributing presents of food, upon worshipping the gods, upon honouring the Brâhmanas, upon discharging his duty of privately reciting (and teaching) the Veda, and upon refreshing the manes (with oblations of balls of rice, water, and the like), he will attain the world of Indra.
60	1	In (the last watch of the night, which is called)the hour sacred to Brahman, let him rise and void his excrements.
60	2	By night (let him void them) facing the south, by day and during either twilight (let him void them) facing the north.
60	3	(He must) not (void them) on earth which has not been previously covered (with grass and the like);
60	4	Nor on a ploughed field;
60	5	Nor in the shade of a tree (fit to be used for sacrifices);
60	6	Nor on barren soil;
60	7	Nor on a spot abounding in fresh grass;
60	8	Nor where there are worms or insects;
60	9	Nor in a ditch (or hole, or upon the roots of a tree);
60	10	Nor on an ant-hill;
60	11	Nor on a path;
60	12	Nor on a public road;
60	13	Nor in a place previously defiled by another person;
60	14	Nor in a garden;
60	15	Nor in the vicinity of a garden or of (a reservoir of) water;
60	16	Nor on ashes;
60	17	Nor on coal;
60	18	Nor oncow-dung;
60	19	Nor in a fold for cattle;
60	20	Nor in the air;
60	21	Nor in water;
60	22	Nor facing the wind, or fire, or the moon, or the sun, or a woman, or a (father or other) Guru, or a Brâhmana;
60	23	Nor without having enveloped his head;
60	24	Having cleaned his hindparts with a clod of earth, or with a brick, (or with wood or grass,) and seizing his organ (with his left, after having removed his garment), he must rise and clean himself with water and earth (previously) fetched for the purpose, so as to remove the smell and the filth.
60	25	The organ must once be cleaned with earth, the hindparts three times, the one hand (the left) ten times, both hands together seven times, and both feet together three times.
60	26	Such is the purification ordained for householders; it is double for students treble for hermits; and quadruple for ascetics.
61	1	A householder must not use Palâsa-wood for cleaning his teeth.
61	2	Nor (must he use the twigs of) the Sleshmântaka(or Selu) plant, nor of the soap plant, nor of the Vibhîtaka (or Kalidruma) tree, nor of the Dhava plant, nor of the Dhâmani tree (for that purpose).
61	3	Nor (the twigs of) the Bandhûka (or Bandhugîvaka) plant, nor of the Nirgundî shrub, nor of theS
61	4	Nor (the twigs of) the Kovidâra (Yugapattraka) Samî, Pîlu (Gudaphala), Pippala (holy fig-tree), Inguda, or Guggula trees;
61	5	Nor (the twigs of) the Pâribhâdraka (Sakrapâdapa), or tamarind, or Mokaka, or Semul trees, nor those of the hemp plant;
61	6	Nor sweet plants (such as liquorice sticks):
61	7	Nor sour plants (such as Âmlikâs);
61	9	Nor twigs that have withered on the stem;
61	9	Nor perforated (or otherwise faulty) wood;
61	10	Nor stinking wood;
61	11	Nor smooth wood;
61	12	He must not (use the sticks) facing the south or west.
61	13	He must use them facing the north or east;
61	14	He may use (the twigs of) the banyan or Asana trees, or of the Arka plant, or of the Khadira, or Karañga, or Badara (jujube), or Sal, or Nimb trees, or of the Arimeda, shrub, or of the Apâmârga or Malatî plants, or of the Kakubha or Bèl trees;
61	15	Or of the Kashâya tree, or of the Tikta or Katuka plants.
61	16	Before sunrise let him silently clean his teeth with a stick, which must be as thick as the top of the little finger, provided with one end that may be chewed (or 'with a brush'), and twelve Angulas long.
61	17	Having washed and used the stick for cleaning the teeth, he must take care to leave it in a clean place; he must never make use of it on the day of new moon (or on the day of full moon).
62	1	The part at the root of the little finger of a twice-born man is called the Tîrtha sacred to Pragâpati.
62	2	The part at the root of the thumb is called the Tîrtha sacred to Brahman.
62	3	The part at the tops of the fingers is called the Tîrtha sacred to the gods.
62	4	The part at the root of the forefinger is called the Tîrtha sacred to the manes.
62	5	Let him sip water, which has not been put to the fire and is free from foam (and bubbles), which has not been poured out by a Sûdra (or other uninitiated person), or by a man who has one hand only, and which has no saline flavour; and (let him sip it) in a clean place, duly seated, placing (his right hand) between his knees, facing the east or the north (or, the north-east), attentively regarding the water, and in a cheerful mood.
62	6	Let him sip water thrice with the Tîrtha sacredto Brahman (or with the Tîrthas sacred to the gods and to Pragipati respectively).
62	7	Let him wipe his lips twice (with the root of his thumb).
62	8	Let him touch the cavities (above his navel), his head, and his breast with water.
62	9	By water which reaches either their heart, or their throat, or their palate respectively, members of the three twice-born castes are purified each in his turn; a woman and a Sûdra are purified by water which has once touched their palate.
63	1	In order to obtain wealth and for the sake of security he shall apply to a lord.
63	2	He must not travel alone;
63	3	Nor with wicked companions;
63	4	Nor with Sûdras;
63	5	Nor with enemies;
63	6	Nor too early in the morning;
63	7	Nor too late in the evening;
63	8	Nor in the twilight;
63	11	Nor in too great a hurry;
63	12	Nor at night
63	13	Nor (let him travel) without cessation with (horses or other) beasts of draught that are quite young, diseased, or (otherwise) afflicted;
63	14	Nor with such as are deficient in limb;
63	15	Nor with weak ones;
63	16	Nor with young bulls;
63	17	Nor with untrained animals.
63	18	He must not appease his hunger and allay his thirst without having first given grass and water to the animals.
63	19	He must not stop at a place where four ways meet;
63	20	Nor at night at the root of a tree:
63	21	Nor in an empty house;
63	22	Nor upon a meadow;
63	23	Nor in a stable;
63	24	Nor (must he stand) on hair, on the husks of grain, on potsherds, on bones, on ashes, or coal;
63	25	Nor on seeds of the cotton plant.
63	26	When he passes by a place where four ways meet, let him turn his right side towards it.
63	27	And let him do the same in passing by the image of a deity;
63	28	And in passing by well-known large trees.
63	29	After having seen a fire, or a Brâhmana (with his turban on), or a public prostitute, or a jar filled (with water), or a looking-glass, or an umbrella, or a flag, or a banner, or a Bèl tree, or a lid (or platter), or a palace built in the shape of a certain diagram (or in the form of a quadrangle without a western gate);
63	30	Or a fan, or a chowrie, or a horse, or an elephant, or a goat, or a cow (having a calf), or sour milk, or milk, or honey, or white mustard;
63	31	Or a lute, or sandal-wood, or a weapon, or fresh cow-dung, or fruit, or a flower, or a fresh pot-herb, or Gorokanâ, or blades of Dûrvâ grass;
63	32	Or a turban, or ornaments, or jewels, or gold, or silver, or clothes, or a seat, or a vehicle, or (raw) meat;
63	33	Or a golden vase, or cultivated land which is being carried away (by a stream), or a single (bull or other) piece of cattle tied with a rope, or an unmarried damsel (clad in white), or a (boiled) fish, (let him turn his right side towards them and) go on.
63	34	Having seen one intoxicated, or insane, deformed, he must or turn back;
63	35	(Also, if he has seen) one who has vomited, or one who has been purged, or one who has had his head shorn, or one who wears all his hair tied in one knot, or a dwarf;
63	36	Or (if he has seen) one wearing a dress (of a reddish-yellow colour) dyed with Kashâya, or an ascetic, or one smeared (with ashes);
63	37	Or (if he has seen) oil, or sugar, or dry cow-dung, or fire-wood, or grass (other than Kusa or Dûrvâ grass), or Palâsa (and other leaves, other than betel leaves), ashes, or coal;
63	38	Or (if he has seen) salt, or a eunuch, or (the spirituous liquor called) Âsava, or an impotent man, or cotton cloth, or a rope, or an iron chain for the feet, or a person with dishevelled hair.
63	39	(If he sees), while about to begin a journey, a lute, or sandal-wood, or fresh pot-herbs, or a turban, or an Ornament, or an unmarried damsel, he must praise them.
63	40	He must not (knowingly) step on (or step over, or stand on) the shade of the image of a deity, of a (learned) Brâhmana, of a spiritual teacher, of a brown (bull or other animal), or of one by whom the initiatory ceremony at a Soma-sacrifice has been performed.
63	41	Nor (must he step) on anything spat out or vomited, nor on blood, nor on fæces or urine, nor on water used for ablutions.
63	42	He must not step over a rope to which a calf (or a cow) is tied.
63	43	He must not walk quickly in the rain.
63	44	He must not cross a river without need;
63	45	Nor without having previously offered an oblation of water to the gods and to the manes;
63	46	Nor (swimming) with his arms;
63	47	Nor in a leaky vessel.
63	48	He must not stand on the bank (of a river).
63	49	He must not gaze into a pool.
63	50	He must not cross it (by swimming through it, or in any other way).
63	51	Way must be made for an aged man, for one carrying a burden, for a king, for a Snâtaka (of any of the three kinds), for a woman, for a sick person, for a bridegroom, and for one riding in a carriage. Among those, should they all meet, a king must behonoured by the rest (excepting the Snâtaka); but the king himself must show honour to a Snâtaka.
64	1	He must not bathe in another man's pool;
64	2	In cases of distress (if there is no other water at hand) he may bathe (in another man's pool), after having offered up five (or seven, or four) lumps of clay and (three jars with) water.
64	3	(He must not bathe) during an indigestion;
64	4	Nor while he is afflicted (with a fever or other illness);
64	5	Nor without his clothes;
64	6	Nor at night;
64	7	Unless it be during an eclipse;
64	8	Nor in the twilight.
64	9	, He must bathe early in the morning, when he beholds the east reddening with the rays of the (rising) sun.
64	10	After having bathed, he must not shake his head (in order to remove the water from his hair);
64	11	And he must not dry his limbs (with his hand or with a cloth);
64	12	Nor must he touch any oily substance.
64	13	He must not put on again the garment which he wore before, without its having been washed.
64	14	After having bathed, he must cover with his head a turban and put on two garments washed (by himself).
64	15	He must not converse, (after having bathed,) with barbarians, low-caste persons, or outcasts.
64	16	He must bathe in cascades, ponds dug by the gods, and lakes.
64	17	Stagnant water is more pure (and purifies more effectually) than water taken out (of a well or the like); the water of a spring is more pure than that of a tank; the water of a river is more pure than the former; water collected by (Vasishtha or some other) devout sage is even more pure; but the water of the Ganges is the purest of all.
64	19	After having removed the dirt by means of earth and water, and after having dived under water and returned (to the bank of the river), he must address the bathing-place with the three Mantras (beginning with the words), 'Ye waters are,'with the four Mantras (beginning with the words),'The golden-coloured (waters),' and with (the one Mantra beginning with the words), 'Carry away (all), that, O ye waters.'
64	19	Then he must dive underwater and mutter the Aghamarshana three times;
64	20	Or (he must mutter three times the Mantra which begins with the words), 'That most exalted step of Vishnu;'
64	21	Or the Drupadâ Sâvitrî (which begins with the words, 'Like one released from a post);
64	22	Or the Anuvâka (which begins with the words), 'They get their minds ready;'
64	23	Or the Purushasûkta.
64	24	After having bathed, he must feed the gods and the manes, while standing in the water with his wet clothes on.
64	25	If (being unable to remain in water after having bathed) he has changed his dress, (he must feed the gods and the manes,) after having crossed the bathing-place (and reached the bank).
64	26	(But) he must not wring his bathing-dress till he has satisfied the gods and the manes.;
64	27	After having bathed and sipped water, he must sip water (once more) according to the rule.
64	28	He must offer (sixteen) flowers to Purusha,while muttering the Purushasûkta, one with each verse.
64	29	Afterwards (he must offer) a libation of water.
64	30	He must first offer one to the gods with the Tîrtha sacred to the gods.
64	31	Then he must offer an other to the manes with the Tîrtha sacred to the manes.
64	32	In offering the latter he must first of all feed (the manes of) his next of kin (such as his father, mother, maternal grandfather, uncles, brothers, &c.)
64	33	After that (he must feed) his relatives (such as a sister's son, a father-in-law, a brother-in-law, &c.) and distant kinsmen (such as the sons of his father's sisters and of his mother's sisters).
64	34	Then (he must feed) his (deceased) friends.
64	35	According, to the above rule he must bathe every day.
64	36	After having bathed, he must mutter as many purifying Mantras as possible.
64	37	And he must mutter the Gâyatrî even more often (than other Mantras);
64	38	And the Purushasûkta.
64	39	There is nothing more sublime than those two (prayers).
64	40	One who has bathed is thereby entitled to perform the offerings to the Visvedevâs and to the manes, to mutter sacred texts, and to exercise the duty of hospitality, as prescribed by law.
64	41	Distress and misfortune, bad dreams and evil thoughts are taken from him even who only sprinkles himself with water (no matter from where it comes): that is the law.
64	42	He who regularly takes the prescribed bath (every morning), does not experience the tortures of Yama's hell. By the regular bath criminals even obtain their absolution.
65	1	Now then, after having duly bathed, and duly washed his hands and feet, and duly sipped water, he must worship Bhagavat Vâsudeva (Vishnu), who is without beginning and end, before an idol or on the sacrificial ground.
65	2	Having called up in his mind (Vishnu to life, with the Mantra), 'The two Asvins possess life, may they (give you life),'and having invited (Vishnu) with the Anuvâka (beginning with the words), 'They get their minds ready,' he must worship him with his knees, his hands, and his head.
65	3	With the three Mantras (beginning with the words), 'Ye waters are,' he must (fetch and) announce the Arghya (or water for washing the hands).
65	4	With the four Mantras (beginning with the words), 'The golden-coloured,' (he must fetch and announce) the water for washing the feet;

65	9	With (the one Mantra, beginning with the word), 'Blooming,' a flower;
65	10	With (the one Mantra, beginning with thewords), 'Thou art murderous (dhûr), slay (dhûrva) (the slayer),' incense (dhûpa);
65	11	With (the one Mantra, beginning with the words), 'Thou art splendour and light,' a lamp;
65	12	With (the one Mantra, beginning with the words, 'I have praised) Dadhikrâvan,' a Madhuparka (honey-mixture);
65	13	With the eight Mantras (beginning with the word), 'Hiranyagarbha,' an offering of (other) eatables.
65	14	A chowrie, a fan, a looking-glass, an umbrella, a (palanquin or other) vehicle, and a (throne or other) seat, all these objects he must announce (and place before) the god (Vishnu), muttering the Gâyatrî (at the same time).
65	15	After having thus worshipped him, he must mutter the Purushasûkta. After that, he who wishes to obtain eternal bliss must make oblations of clarified butter, while reciting the same hymn.
66	1	He must not make an oblation to the gods or to the manes with water collected at night.
66	2	He must not give any other fragrant substance than sandal, or musk, or (fragrant) wood (of the odoriferous Devadâru tree), or camphor, or saffron, or the wood of the Gâtîphala tree;
66	3	Nor a garment dyed with indigo;
66	4	Nor an ornament made of factitious jewels or gold;
66	5	Nor (a flower) having a nasty odour;
66	6	Nor one that has no odour at all;
66	7	Nor one grown upon a thorny plant.
66	8	But he may give even a flower grown upon a thorny plant, if it is white and sweet-smelling.
66	9	He may give even a red flower, if it is saffron, or a water-flower (such as the red lotus).
66	10	(He must) not (give) any animal substance (such as claws or horns) for the incense.
66	11	(He must) not (give) anything but clarified butter or oil for the lamp.
66	12	(He must) not (give) forbidden food at the offering of eatables;
66	13	Nor the milk of goats or female buffalos, though it is lawful food (otherwise);
66	14	Nor the flesh of five-toed animals, of fishes, and of boars.
66	15	Fully prepared for the sacrifice and pure, he must announce (and offer up to Vishnu) all the oblations, with his mind fixed upon the deity, with a cheerful heart, and free from precipitation or anger.
67	1	After having swept the place around the (kitchen) fire, sprinkled it with water all around,strewed (Kusa grass) all around, and sprinkled (the latter) with water all around, he must take out of all dishes the uppermost part and offer it:
67	2	To Vâsudeva, to Sankarshana, to Pradyumna, to Aniruddha, to Purusha, to Satya, to Akyuta, to Vâsudeva.
67	3	Afterwards (he must offer twelve burnt-oblations) to Agni, to Soma, to Mitra, to Varuna, to Indra, to Indra and Agni united, to the Visvedevâs, to Pragâpati, to Anumati, to Dhanvantari, to Vâstoshpati, and to Agni Svishtakrit (the god of the fire who causes the proper performance of the sacrifice).
67	4	Then let him make a Bali-offering with that which has been left of the dishes.
67	5	To (the serpent demons) Taksha and Upataksha,
67	6	(Strewing the two Balis) on both sides of the fire, to the east of it (on the north-eastern side first, and on the south-eastern side afterwards).
67	7	(Then let him offer other seven Balis) to all (the seven Ishtakâs or goddesses of the bricks of the altar, also to the east of the fire, while pronouncing the Mantras), 'Thy name is Ambâ; thy name is Dulâ; thy name is Nitatnî (Nitatnir); thy name is Kupunîkâ (and so on).'
67	8	(He must offer four Balis with the Mantras), 'O Nandinî; O Subhagâ; O Sumangalî; O Bhadrankarî,' (placing the Balis) in the corners (beginning with the south-eastern corner and proceeding) towards the south.
67	9	(He must place two Balis), addressed to Sri Hiranyakesî and to the trees, near the firm pillar.
67	10	(He must place two Balis), addressed to Dharma and Adharma and to Mrityu, near the door.
67	11	(He must place one Bali), addressed to Varuna, in the water-jar.
67	12	(With the words, 'Adoration be) to Vishnu,' (he must place one Bali) in the mortar.
67	13	(With the words, 'Adoration be) to the Maruts,' (he must place one Bali) on the mill-stone.
67	14	(In the apartment) on the roof (let him place two Balis) addressed to Vaisrâvana (Kubera) the king, and to all created beings.
67	15	(With the words, 'Adoration be) to Indra and to Indra's ministers,' (he must place two Balis). in the eastern part (of the house).
67	16	(With the words, 'Adoration be) to Yama and to Yama's ministers,' (he must place two Balis) in the southern part..
67	17	(With the words, 'Adoration be) to Varuna and to Varuna's ministers,' (he must place two Balis) in the western part.
67	18	(With the words, 'Adoration be) to Soma and to Soma's ministers,' (let him place two Balis) in the northern part.
67	19	(With the words, 'Adoration be) to Brahman and to Brahman's ministers,' (let him place two Balis) in the centre (of the house).
67	20	(Let him throw) in the air (a Bali) addressed to Âkâsa (the air).
67	21	(With the words, 'Adoration be) to the goblins roaming by day,' (let him place a Bali) on the sacrificial ground.
67	22	(With the words, 'Adoration be to the goblins) roaming by night,' (let him offer a Bali in the same place at the Vaisvadeva which takes place) at night.
67	23	Afterwards he must offer upon blades of Kusa grass, having the points turned towards the south, balls of rice to his father, to his grandfather, and to his great-grandfather, to his mother, to his grandmother, and to his great-grandmother, proclaiming at the same time their name and race (and adding the word Svadhâ, 'reverence').
67	24	Along with the balls of rice let him give ointments, flowers, incense, eatables, and the like.
67	25	After having fetched a jar with water, let himcause a Brâhmana to say the benediction (and give him the jar).
67	26	(The share) of dogs, crows, and Svapakas let him strew upon the earth.
67	27	And let him give (a mouthful of food as) alms.
67	28	By honouring guests he obtains the highest reward.
67	29	Let him assiduously honour a guest who arrives in the evening (after the Vaisvadeva is over).
67	30	Let him not suffer a guest to stay at his house unfed.
67	31	As the Brâhmanas are lords over all other castes, and as a husband is lord over his wives, a guest is the lord of a householder.
67	32	By honouring a guest he obtains heaven.
67	33	(One who has arrived as) a guest and is obliged to turn home disappointed in his expectations, takes away from the man, to whose house he has come, his religious merit, and throws his own guilt upon him.
67	34	A Brâhmana who stays for one night only as a guest, is called atithi (a guest); because he does not stay for a long time, therefore is he termed atithi.
67	35	Let him not consider a Brâhmana fellow-villager or an acquaintance as his guest, though he has come to the house where his wife and his fires are.
67	16	But if a Kshatriya has come to his house in the way of a guest, let him hospitably entertain him also, to his heart's desire, after the Brâhmana guests have eaten.
67	37	Should a Vaisya or a Sûdra come to his house as guests, he must even give food to them (at the same time and) with his servants, and treat them with kindness (but not like guests in the proper sense of the term).
67	38	To (members of) other castes (such as Mûrdhâvasiktas) and to friends (or relatives or) other such persons, who have come to his house out of attachment, let him offer such food as happens to be there, to the best of his power, at the time when his wife takes her meal.
67	39	One recently married (but not yet delivered to her husband), an unmarried damsel, a sick woman, and a pregnant woman: to these let him give food unhesitatingly, even before his guests.
67	40	The foolish man who eats first himself, without having offered food to those (persons that have been mentioned), is not aware that he will himself be food (after death) for dogs and vultures.
67	41	After the Brâhmanas, (the Kshatriyas who have come as guests), the friends and relatives, (the parents and others) whom he is bound to maintain,(and the servants) have made their repast, let man and wife eat the leavings themselves.
67	42	Having shown honour to the gods, to the manes, to men, to those whom he is bound to maintain, and to the household deities (as well as to dogs, crows, and the rest), let a householder enjoy that which has been left.
67	43	He who cooks food for himself only, cats nothing but sin: for that alone is considered as fit food for the virtuous, which is left, after the (customary) oblations have been offered.
67	44	By the daily recitation of the Veda, by the Agnihotra, by sacrificing, and by austerity, a householder does not obtain such excellent places of abode (after death) as by honouring a guest.
67	45	Whether he arrives in the evening or in the morning, he must offer a seat and water to his guest, and food, to the best of his ability, after having shown him marks of honour as the law directs.
67	46	By giving (to a guest) shelter, a bed, ointments for his feet, and a lamp: for each of these gifts singly he reaps the same reward as for the gift of a cow.
68	1	He must not eat during an eclipse of the moon or of the sun.
68	2	He shall eat, after having previously bathed, when the eclipse is over.
68	3	If (the sun or moon) have set before the eclipse was over, he must bathe, and on the next day he may eat again, after having seen (the sun or moon rise),
68	4	A cow or a Brâhmana having met with a calamity, he must not eat on that day.
68	5	If the king has met with an accident, (he must not eat on that day).
68	6	An Agnihotrin, who is absent on a journey, must eat at that time of the day when the Agnihotra is supposed to be over.
68	7	He may also eat at that time of the day when the Vaisvadeva is supposed to be over.
68	8	On the days of new and full moon (he may eat at that time) when he supposes the sacrifice customary on those days to have been performed.
68	9	He must not eat during an indigestion;
68	10	Nor at midnight;
68	11	Nor at noon;
68	12	Nor in the twilight;
68	13	Nor dressed in wet clothes;
68	14	Nor without his upper garment;
68	15	Nor naked;

68	22	Nor (having placed the food) upon the ground;
68	23	Nor from the palm of his hand.
68	24	That food which has been seasoned with salt (after having been cooked) he must not eat.
68	25	He must not abuse children (eating in the same row with him).
68	26	(He must) not (eat) dainties alone.
68	27	(He must) not (eat) substances from which the fat has been extracted.
68	28	, Nor (must he eat) roasted grain in the daytime.
68	29	At night (he must not eat) anything mixed with sesamum-seeds.
68	30	Nor (must he eat at night) sour milk or ground barley.
68	31	Nor (must he eat) the leaves of the mountain ebony, or of the banyan, or of the holy fig-tree, or of the hemp plant.
68	32	(He must) not (eat) without having first given to eat (to the gods and to the Brâhmanas); Nor without having made a burnt-offering first
68	34	Nor without having sprinkled his feet;
68	35	Nor without having sprinkled his hands and his face;
68	36	While having the remains of food en his mouth or hands, he must not take clarified butter.

68	38	Nor must he touch his head (while unclean).
68	39	Nor must he recite the Veda (while unclean).
68	40	He must eat facing the east;
68	41	Or facing the south;
68	42	And after having honoured his food;
68	43	And cheerfully, adorned with a garland of flowers, and anointed with unguents.
68	44	He must not eat up his food completely;
68	45	Unless it consist of sour milk, or honey, or (clarified) butter, or milk, or ground barley, or meat, or sweetmeats.
68	46	He must not eat together with his wife, nor in the open air, nor standing, nor in the presence of many (hungry spectators), nor must many eat in the presence of one (hungry spectator).
68	47	Let him never eat in an empty house, in a house where the sacred fires are preserved, or in a temple dedicated to the gods. Neither must he drink water out of his joined hands, or satiate himself to repletion.
68	48	, Let him not take a third meal (over and above the two regular meals in the mornings and evenings), nor let him ever take unwholesome food. He must eat neither too early, nor too late, and he must take no food in the evening, after having fully satiated himself in the morning.
68	49	He must not eat bad food (whether injurious to health or otherwise reprehensible), nor from a bad dish (which is similar to the dishes used by barbarians, or which has been defiled by a wicked man eating from it), nor lying on the ground, nor with his feet raised upon a bench, nor sitting on his hams with a cloth tied round his legs and knees.
69	1	He must not have connection with his wife on the eighth, or fourteenth, or fifteenth day of the half-month.

69	3	And after having given (a Srâddha);

71	54	He must not reject sour milk or the Sumanas flower (when offered to him).

71	56	Let him not rouse (a superior) from sleep.
71	57	He must not (by harsh speeches and the like) render disaffected one who is well affected towards him.
71	58	He must not speak to a woman in her courses;
71	59	Nor to barbarians or low-caste persons.

71	61	If he sees a cow trespassing upon another man's field, he must not announce it (to the owner of that field).
71	62	And if he sees a calf sucking (at the udder of a cow, he must not announce it to the owner of the latter).
71	63	He must not endeavour to please overbearing men (by flattering their pretensions).
71	64	He must not dwell in a kingdom governed by a Sûdra king;
71	65	Nor in one abounding with wicked people;
71	66	And he must not live (in a kingdom) in which there are no physicians;
71	67	Nor in one afflicted (with a disease or other calamity).
71	68	And (he must not stay) long on a mountain.
71	69	He must not (walk or otherwise) exert himself without a purpose.
71	70	He must not dance or sing.
71	71	He must not make a noise by slapping (his left arm, after having placed it upon his right shoulder, with his right hand).
71	72	He must not make vulgar speeches.

71	75	He must not strike any one upon a vital part.

71	78	He must not play with (venomous) serpents or with weapons.
71	79	He must not touch the cavities of his body without a cause.

71	87	He must not cut even grass (on those two days).
71	88	He must adorn himself (with garlands, sandal, and the like).
71	89	Thus he must observe established customs.
71	90	Those customs, which have been explicitly ordained in revealed and in traditional texts, and which are practised by the virtuous, must always be observed by a righteous man with subdued passions.
71	91	By adhering to established usage he attains to old age; this is the way to obtain that state in the next life which he desires, and imperishable riches, this is the way to destroy the effect of (bodily) marks foreboding future misfortunes.
71	92	He who observes the usages established among the virtuous, who is a believer in revelation, and free from ill-will, lives a hundred years, eventhough he does not possess any external marks of prosperity.
72	1	He must persist in keeping his mind and his organs of sense under restraint.
72	2	Restraint of the mind implies restraint of the senses.
72	3	One who has acquired complete command over himself, gains this world and the next.
72	4	One who has no command over himself, reaps no fruit from any of his acts (whether worldly or tending to the acquisition of spiritual merit).
72	5	Self-restraint is the best instrument of purification; self-restraint is the best of auspicious objects; by self-restraint he obtains anything he may desire in his heart.
72	6	The man who rides (as it were) in a chariot drawn by his five senses and directed by his mind (as the charioteer), who keeps it on the path of the virtuous, can never be overcome by his enemies (lust, wrath, and greed), unless the horses (unrestrained by the charioteer) run away with the chariot.
72	7	As the waters (of all streams) are stored up (and reabsorbed) in the ocean, which, though being filled with them, remains unmoved and tranquil, even so that man, in whose mind the passions are stored up (and dissolved), obtains perfect calmness but not he who strives after the gratification of his desires.
73	1	One desirous of celebrating a Srâddha must invite the Brâhmanas on the day before (it is to take place).
73	2	On the next day, in the forenoon, if it falls in the bright half of the month, and in the afternoon, if it falls in the dark half of the month, the Brâhmanas, who must have duly bathed and duly sipped water, must be placed by him, in the order of their seniority' (or) of their sacred knowledge, upon seats covered with Kusa grass.
73	3	(He must entertain) two (Brâhmanas) facing the east at the Srâddha of the gods (Visvedevâs), and three facing the north at the Srâddha of the manes;
73	4	Or one only at each Srâddha.
73	5	After having (worshipped the Visvedevâs and) offered a burnt-oblation: during the recitation of the first Pañkaka (pentad) at a Srâddha repast consistingof undressed grain or performed for the gratification of a special desire;
73	6	At a Srâddha repast consisting of meat, during the recitation of the second Pañkaka;
73	7	At a new moon (Srâddha), during the recitation of the last Pañkaka;
73	8	On the Ashtakâs (or eighth days) of the (three) dark halves subsequent to the full moon day of the month Âgrahâyana (or Mârgasîrsha), during the recitation of the first, second, and last Pañkakas respectively;
73	9	Likewise on the Anvashtakâs (or ninth days of the dark halves of those months);
73	10	He must invite the manes, after having received permission to do so from the Brâhmanas.
73	11	Having driven away the Yâtudhânas by strewing grains of sesamum and by reciting the twoMantras (the first of which begins with the words), 'May the Asuras go away;'
73	12	He must invite the manes (with the four Mantras), 'Come near, O ye manes,' '(Conduct) them all (here), O Agni,' 'May my (ancestors) come near,' 'This is your (share), O ye manes.' Then let him prepare the water for washing the feet with scented water, which has been mixed up with Kusa grass and sesamum, while reciting (the three Mantras), 'Those standing,' 'Speech is imperishable,' and 'What my mother (has sinned),' and offer it (to the Brâhmanas); let him prepare the Arghya (or water mixed with Dûrvâ grass, flowers, &c.) and offer it to them; let him offer to the Brâhmanas, to the best of his power, Kusa grass, sesamum, clothes, flowers, ornaments, incense, and lamps; let him take food sprinkled with clarified butter; let him look them in the face with the Mantra, 'O ye Âdityas, Rudras, and Vasus;' let him say, 'I will offer an oblation in the fire,' and if the Brâhmanas say, 'Offer an oblation,' let him offer three burnt-oblations.'
73	13	After having consecrated the offerings with the Mantras, 'They, who are my ancestors,' 'This is your (share), O ye manes,' and 'This offering,' he must pour (what is left of) the food into such vessels as happen to be there, or (into golden ones at the offering addressed to the Visvedevâs and) into silverones (at the offering addressed to the manes), and offer it first to the two Brâhmanas facing the east (who have been invited to the Srâddha of the gods).
73	14	Afterwards he must offer it to the (three) Brâhmanas facing north (who represent his three ancestors, addressing himself) to his father, grandfather and great-grandfather, (and calling out) their name and race.
73	15	While the Brâhmanas are eating the food, let him mutter (the three Mantras), 'Whatever (trickles down) through my fault,' 'With days and nights,' and 'Whatever (limb) of yours, Agni.'
73	16	And (let him mutter) the Itihâsa (Epics), Purâna (Legends), and the Dharmasâstra (Institutes of the Sacred Law).
73	17	Near the leavings let him deposit upon blades of Kusa grass with the ends turned towards the south one ball of rice for his father, while saying, 'Earth is (like) a spoon, imperishable (satisfaction).'
73	18	With the Mantra, 'Air is (like) a spoon, imperishable (satisfaction,' let him deposit) a second ball for his grandfather.
73	19	With the Mantra, 'Heaven is (like) a spoon, imperishable (satisfaction,' let him deposit) a third ball for his great-grandfather.
73	20	With the Mantra, 'Those ancestors whohave died,' let him place a garment (upon the balls).
73	21	With the Mantra, 'Give us sons, O ye manes,' (let him place) food upon them.
73	22	With the Mantra, 'Enjoy it, O ye manes, partake of it,  imparting vigour,' let him sprinkle the balls to the right with the wet (remainder of the food), and offer the Argha, flowers, incense, unguents, and rice, and other victuals and dainties to the Brâhmanas.
73	24	And (he must offer them, ) a jar with water, which has been mixed up with honey, clarified butter, sesamum, and (ointments, oil, and the like).
73	25	The Brâhmanas having eaten and being satisfied, let him sprinkle the food (as much as has been left by them) and the grass with the Mantra, 'Mayest thou not fail me,' and strew the food near the leavings; and having asked them, 'Are you satisfied? Is (the Srâddha) finished,' he must first give water for sipping to the Brâhmanas facing the north, and then to those facing the east; and he must sprinkle the place where the Srâddha has been offered (with water, with the Mantra), 'Well sprinkled.' All these rites he must perform while holding blades of sacred grass in his hand.
73	26	Afterwards he must, while turning his face towards the Brâhmanas facing the east, circumambulatethem from left to right, with the Mantra, 'What a crow (may have eaten of my offering),' and turn back again; he must honour them with sacrificial fees, to the best of his power, saying, 'May you be satisfied,' and on their answering, 'We are satisfied,' he must address them with the Mantra, 'The gods and the manes.'
73	27	After having given (to all) water (with the Mantra, 'May the food and water and whatever else I gave you be) imperishable,' (and calling out their name and race, and having added the Mantra, 'May the Visvedevâs be satisfied,' he must ask, with folded hands, and with an attentive and cheerful mind, the following (benediction) from the Brâhmanas facing the east:
73	28	'May the liberal-minded in our race increase in number, and may the (study of the) Vedas and our progeny (also increase). May faith not depart from us, and may we have plenty to bestow on the poor.
73	29	They shall answer, 'Thus let it be.'
73	30	(The second half of the benediction shall be, as follows), "May we have plenty of food, and may we receive guests. May others come to beg of us, and may not we be obliged to beg of any one.'
73	31	After having received this double benediction (through the Brâhmanas saying, 'Thus let it be'),
73	32	He must dismiss the Brâhmanas, with the Mantra, 'With all food,' after having honoured them according to custom, accompanied them (as far as the limits of his estate), and taken his leave of them.
74	1	After having worshipped, on each Ashtakâ, the gods and performed, with vegetables, meat, and cakes respectively, a Srâddha (according to the rules given in the last chapter), he must, on each Anvashtakâ, worship the gods and offer a burnt-oblation in the same way as on the Ashtakâ (i.e. reciting the same three Pañkakas successively), and entertain Brâhmanas in the same way as (directed) before (in the preceding chapter), in honour of his mother, his paternal grandmother, and his paternal great-grandmother, honour them with presents, accompany them (as far as the limits of his estate), and dismiss them
74	2	Then he must dig (six) trenches.
74	3	On the border of these trenches, to the northeast of them, he must light fires and place balls of rice.
74	4	On the border of three of the trenches (he must place balls) for the men, and on the border of the other three (he must place balls) for the women.
74	5	He must fill the three trenches for the men with water mixed with food.
74	6	(He must fill) the three trenches for the women with milk mixed with food.
74	7	(And he must fill up) each triad of trenches singly with sour milk, meat, and milk.
74	8	After having filled (the trenches), he must mutter the Mantra, 'May this (food) be imperishable for ye men and for ye women.'
75	1	He who makes a Srâddha-offering while his father is alive, must offer it to those persons to whom his father offers (his Srâddhas).
75	2	(If he offers a Srâddha) while both his father and grandfather are alive, (he must offer it to those persons) to whom his grandfather (offers his Srâddhas).
75	3	While his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather are alive, he must offer no Srâddha at all.
75	4	He whose father is dead (but whose grandfather is alive), must first of all offer a ball of rice to his father, after that, two balls to the two ancestors coming before his grandfather (or to his great-grandfather and to his fourth ascendant).
75	5	He whose father and grandfather are dead (but whose great-grandfather is alive), must first offer two balls to those two, and then offer one ball to the grandfather of his grandfather.
75	6	He whose grandfather is dead (but whose father and great-grandfather are alive), must give one ball to his grandfather and two balls to the father and grandfather of his great-grandfather.
75	7	An intelligent man must offer Srâddhas to his maternal grandfather, and to the father and grandfather of him, in the same way (as to his paternal ancestors), duly modifying the Mantras. But the Srâddhas addressed to other relatives, (uncles, brothers, and the like, must be performed) without Mantras.
76	1	The (twelve) days of new moon, the three Ashtakâs, the three Anvashtakâs, a Mâgha day (i.e. 'day on which the moon enters the lunar asterism Maghâ'), which falls on the thirteenth of the dark half of the month Praushthapada, and the two seasons when rice and barley grow ripe (or autumn and spring):
76	2	Thus have the regular times for a Srâddha been declared by the lord of creatures. He who fails to perform a Srâddha on those days, goes to hell.
77	1	The sun's passage from one sign of the zodiac, to another;
77	2	The two equinoctial points;
77	3	The two solstitial points particularly;
77	4	The (Yoga) Vyatîpâta;
77	5	The constellation under which (the sacrificer himself, or his wife, or his son) is born;
77	6	A time of rejoicing (as, when a son has been born, or another happy event happened):
77	7	These occasions for a Srâddha the lord of creatures has pronounced optional; a Srâddha which is performed on these occasions gives infinite satisfaction (to the manes).
77	8	No Srâddha must be performed in the twilight or at night by an intelligent man. A Srâddha may be performed at those times also when an eclipse (of the sun or of the moon) takes place.
77	9	For a Srâddha which is offered them at the time of an eclipse satisfies the manes, as long as the moon and the stars exist, and procures immense advantages and the satisfaction of all his desires to the sacrificer.

82	6	Nor those wearing the insignia of some particular order, without having a claim to them;
82	7	Nor astrologers;
82	8	Nor Brâhmanas who subsist upon the offerings made to an idol which they attend;
82	9	Nor physicians;
82	10	Nor sons of an unmarried woman;
82	11	Nor sons of the son of an unmarried woman;
82	12	Nor those who sacrifice for a multitude of persons;
82	13	Nor those who offer sacrifices for a whole village;
82	14	Nor those who offer sacrifices for Sûdras;
82	15	Nor those who offer sacrifices for those for whom it is forbidden to sacrifice (such as outcasts and others);
82	16	Nor those for whom the ceremony of initiation has not been performed;
82	17	Nor those who sacrifice for such;
82	18	Nor those who do work on holidays;
82	19	Nor malignant informers;
82	20	Nor those who teach (the Veda) for a fee;
82	21	Nor those who have been taught (the Veda) for a fee;
82	22	Nor those who subsist on food given to them by a Sûdra;

82	27	Nor 'naked' persons;
82	29	Nor those who quarrel with their father;
82	29	Nor those who have forsaken their father, mother, Guru, holy fire, or sacred study.
82	30	All those persons are said to defile a company, because they have been expelled from the community of Brâhmanas. Let a wise man avoid carefully, therefore, to entertain them at a Srâddha.
83	1	The following persons sanctify a company:
83	2	A Trinâkiketa;
83	3	One who keeps five fires;
83	4	One who can sing the Sâmans called Gyeshtha;
83	5	One who has studied the whole Veda;
83	6	One who has studied one Vedânga;
83	7	One who has studied either the Purânas (Legends), or the Itihâsas (Epics), or grammar;
83	8	One who has studied one of the Dharmasâstras (Institutes of the Sacred Law);
83	9	One purified by visiting sacred places of pilgrimage;

83	11	One purified by austere devotion;

83	13	One purified by (constantly muttering) Mantras;
83	14	One intent upon muttering the Gâyatrî;
83	15	One in whose family the study and teaching of the Veda are hereditary.
83	16	One who knows the Trisuparna (the text which thrice contains the word Suparna).
83	17	A son-in-law;
83	18	And a grandson. All these persons are worthy (to be fed at a Srâddha);
83	19	And, particularly, devotees.
83	20	, There is a stanza recited by the manes, which refers to this subject:
83	21	'May that man be born to our race, who feeds a Brâhmana devotee assiduously at a Srâddha, by which repast we are satisfied ourselves.'
84	1	He must not offer a Srâddha in a country inhabited by barbarians.
84	2	He must not visit a country, inhabited by barbarians (excepting on a pilgrimage).
84	3	By (constantly) drinking water from (or bathing in) a pool situated in a foreign (barbarous) country, he becomes equal to its inhabitants.
84	4	Those countries are called barbarous (mlekkha) where the system of the four castes does not exist; the others are denoted Âryâvarta, (the abode of the Âryans).
85	1	A Srâddha offered at the (Tîrtha or place of pilgrimage called) Pushkaras confers eternal bliss upon the giver;
85	2	And so does the muttering of prayers, the offering of burnt-oblations, and the practice of austerities in that place.
85	3	Even by merely bathing at Pushkara he is purified from all his sins.
85	4	The same effect may be produced at Gayâsîrsha;
85	5	And near Vata (Akshayavata);
85	6	And on the Amarakantaka mountain;
85	7	And on the Varâha mountain;
85	8	And anywhere on the bank of the Narmadâ (Nerbudda) river;

85	29	And at Agastyâsrama;
85	30	And at Kanvâsrama (on the Mâlinî river);
85	31	And on the Kausikî (Kosi river);
85	32	And on the bank of the Sarayû (Surju river in Oudh);
85	33	And on the confluence of the Sona (Sone) and Gyotisha rivers;
85	34	And on the Srîparvata (mountain);
85	35	And at (the Tîrtha situated on the Yamunâ, which is called) Kâlodaka.
85	36	And at Uttaramânasa (in the Kedâr mountains, in the Himâlayas).
85	37	And at Vadavâ (in the Dekhan).
85	38	And at Matangavâpî (in the southern part of Gayâ);
85	39	And at Saptârsha;
85	40	And at Vishnupada;
85	41	And at Svargamârgapada (or Rathamârga);
85	42	And on the Godâvarî river (in the Dekhan);
85	43	And on the Gomatî (river);
85	44	And on the Vetravatî (river);
85	45	And on the Vipâsâ (river);
85	46	And on the Vitastâ (river);
85	47	And on the banks of the Satadru (river);
85	48	And on the Kandrabhâgâ (river);
85	49	And on the Îrâvati (river);
85	50	And on the banks of the Indus;
85	51	And on the southern Pañkanada;
85	52	And at Ausaga (?);
85	53	And at other such Tîrthas;
85	54	And on the banks of (other) holy rivers;
85	55	And anywhere at the birth-place of a deity, (such as Râma, Krishna, and others);
85	56	And on sand-banks;
85	57	And near waterfalls;
85	58	And on mountains;
85	59	And in arbours (the sporting-places of Krishna);
85	60	And in woods;
85	61	And in groves;
85	62	And in houses smeared with cow-dung,
85	63	And in 'pleasant spots.'
85	64	There are some stanzas recited by the manes, which refer to this subject:
85	65	'May that person be born to our race, who will give us libations of water, taken from streams abounding with water, especially if their floods (coming from the Himâlayas) are cool.
85	66	'May that excellent man be born to our race, who offers us a Srâddha attentively at Gayâsîrsha or at Vata.'
85	67	A man must wish to have many sons, because if only one of them goes to Gayâ (and offers a Srâddha to him after his death), or if he performs a horse-sacrifice, or if he sets a dark-coloured bull at liberty, (he will acquire final emancipation through him.)
86	1	Now follows the ceremony of setting a bull at liberty, (which should take place)
86	2	On the days of full moon in Kârttika or Âsvina.When performing this rite, he must first examine the bull.
86	4	(The bull must be) the offspring of a milch cow having young ones living.
86	5	He must have all marks.
86	6	He must be dark-coloured;
86	7	Or red, but having a white mouth, a white tail.. and white feet and horns.
86	8	He must be one who protects the herd.
86	9	Then, after having (kindled) a blazing fire among the cows (in the cow-pen) and strewed Kusa grass around it, let him boil with milk a dish sacred to Pûshan, and offer (two oblations) in the fire with the Mantras, 'May Pûshan follow our cows,' and 'Here is pleasure.' And let a blacksmith mark the bull.
86	10	On the one flank (the right), with a discus; on the other flank (the left), with a trident.
86	11	After he has been marked, let him wash the bull with the four Mantras, (beginning with the words), 'The golden-coloured,' and with (the five Mantras, beginning with the words), 'May the divine (waters help and propitiate us').
86	12	Having washed and adorned the bull, he must bring him near, together with four young cows,which must also have been washed and decorated, and he must mutter the Rudras, the Purushasûkta, and the Kûshmândîs.
86	13	Then let him pronounce in the bull's right ear the Mantra, 'The father of calves;'
86	14	And the following (Mantras):
86	15	'Holy law is a bull and is declared to have four feet: him I choose for the object of my worship; may he protect me wholly.
86	16	'This young (bull) I give you as husband (O ye calves), roam about sportingly with him for your lover. May we not be deficient in progeny, O king Soma, and may we live long, and may we not be oppressed by our enemies.'
86	17	He must drive away the bull together with the calves in a north-eastern direction and give a pair of garments, gold, and a vessel made of white copper to the officiating priest.
86	18	The blacksmith shall receive as wages as much as he claims, and food prepared with a great deal of butter, and (three) Brâhmanas shall be fed.
86	19	Any pool from which the bull drinks afterhaving been set at liberty) that entire pool will refresh the manes of him who has set the bull at liberty.
86	20	The earth which is anywhere dug up by the bull exulting in his strength, is converted into delicious food and drink to satisfy the manes.
87	1	Now on the day of full moon in the month Vaisâkha he must spread out upon a woollen blanket the skin of a black antelope (together with the horns and hoofs), after having adorned the former with gold and the latter with silver, and after having ornamented the tail with a string of pearls.
87	2	After that, he must cover (that part of the blanket which is not covered by the skin) with sesamum.
87	3	And he must adorn the navel with gold.
87	4	He must cover (the skin) with a couple of new garments.
87	5	He must place all sorts of perfumes and jewels upon it.
87	6	After having placed on its four sides (beginning with the eastern side) four metallic dishes (of copper, silver, white copper, and gold respectively) filled with milk, sour milk, honey, and clarified butter respectively, (and having poured out water) he must give (the skin, seizing it by the tail), to a Brâhmana, who is an Agnihotrin, decked with ornaments, and clad in two garments.
87	7	There are (the following) stanzas in regard to this subject:
87	8	'He who bestows (upon a pious Brâhmana) the skin of a black antelope, together with the hoofs and horns, after having covered it with seeds of sesamum and garments, and adorned it with all sorts of jewels:
87	9	'That man doubtless obtains the same reward as if he were to bestow the whole earth on him, bordered as it is on every side (by the oceans), together with the oceans and caverns, and with rocks, groves, and forests.
87	10	'He who places sesamum, gold, honey, and butter on the skin of a black antelope and gives the whole to a Brâhmana, annihilates the consequences of all his own evil actions.'
88	1	A cow in the act of bringing forth a young one is (comparable to) the earth.
88	2	By bestowing such a cow upon a Brâhmana, after having decked her with ornaments, he obtains the same reward as if he were to bestow the earth (upon him),
88	3	There is a stanza in regard to this subject:
88	4	'One who full of faith and with intense application of mind gives away a pregnant cow, enters heaven for as many Yugas (or ages of the world) as that cow and her calf together have hairs on their bodies.'
89	1	The month Kârttika is sacred to the god Agni.
89	2	Agni is the first of all gods.
89	3	Therefore is that man purified from every sin committed during the past year, who persists during the month Kârttika in bathing (daily) out of the village, in muttering the Gâyatrî, and in taking a single meal each day, consisting of food fit for oblations.
89	4	He who bathes (at the prescribed time, early in the morning) constantly, during the whole month Kârttika, who keeps his organs of sense under control, who mutters (the Gâyatrî), who eats food fit for oblations only, and who governs his passions, is purified from every sin.

96	96	Mind, intellect, the individual Self, and the indiscrete' are 'that which exceeds the senses.'
96	97	This human frame, O Earth, is called 'field.' He who knows (how to enter and how to leave) it is denominated, by those conversant with thesubject, 'the knower of the field' (i.e. Self or Soul).
96	98	Know me, O illustrious one, to be the Self of all fields (whether born from the womb, or arisen from an egg, or from sweat, or from a germ or shoot). Those striving after final emancipation must constantly seek to understand the 'field' and to obtain a knowledge of the knower of the field.
97	1	Sitting with the feet stretched out and crossed so as to touch the thighs, with the right hand (stretched out and) resting upon the left, with the tongue fixed in the palate, and without bringing the one row of teeth in contact with the other, with the eyes directed to the tip of the nose, and without glancing at any of the (four) quarters of the sky, free from fear, and with composure, let him meditate upon (Purusha), who is separate from the twenty-four entities,
97	2	He who is eternal, beyond the cognisance of the senses, destitute of qualities, not concerned with sound, tangibility, form, savour, or odour, knowing everything, of immense size,
97	3	He who pervades everything, and who is devoid of form,
97	4	Whose hands and feet are everywhere, whose eyes, head, and face are everywhere, and who is able to apprehend everything with all the senses.
97	5	Thus let him meditate.
97	6	If he remains absorbed in such meditation for a year, he obtains the accomplishment of Yoga (concentration of the thought and union with the Supreme).
97	7	If he is unable to fix his mind upon the beingdestitute of form, he must meditate successively on earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intellect, self, the indiscrete, and Purusha: having fully apprehended one, he must dismiss it from his thoughts and fix his mind upon the next one in order.
97	8	In this way let him arrive at meditation upon Purusha.
97	9	If unable to follow this method also, he must meditate on Purusha shining like a lamp in his heart, as in a lotus turned upside down.
97	10	If he cannot do that either, he must meditate upon Bhagavat Vâsudeva (Vishnu), who is adorned with a diadem, with ear-rings, and with bracelets, who has the (mystic mark) Srîvatsa and a garland of wood-flowers on his breast, whose aspect is pleasing, who has four arms, who holds the shell, the discus, the mace, and the lotus-flower, and whose feet are supported (and worshipped) by the earth.
97	11	Whatever he meditates upon, that is obtained by a man (in a future existence): such is the mysterious power of meditation.
97	12	Therefore must he dismiss everything perishablefrom his thoughts and meditate upon what is imperishable only.
97	13	There is nothing imperishable except Purusha.
97	14	Having become united with him (through constant meditation), he obtains final liberation.
97	15	Because the great lord pervades the whole universe (pura), as he is lying there (sete), therefore is he denominated Puru-sha by those who reflect upon the real nature (of the Supreme Spirit).
97	16	In the first part and the latter part of the night must a man bent on contemplation constantly and with fixed attention meditate upon Purusha Vishnu, who is destitute of (the three) qualities (sattva, ragas, and tamas) and the twenty-fifth entity.
97	17	He (or it) is composed of the entities, beyond the cognisance of the senses, distinct from all the (other) entities, free from attachment (to the producer, &c.), supporting everything, devoid of qualities and yet enjoying (or witnessing the effect of) qualities.
97	18	It exists without and within created beings (as being enjoyed and as enjoyer), and in the shape both of immovable things (such as trees or stones) and of movable things (such as water or fire); it is undistinguishable on account of its subtlety; it is out of reach (imperceptible), and yet is found in the heart.
97	19	It is not distinct from creation, and yet distinct from it in outward appearance; it annihilates and produces by turns (the world), which consists of everything that has been, that will be, and that is.
97	20	It is termed the light of the sidereal bodies and the enemy of darkness (ignorance), it is knowledge, it should be known, it may be understood (by meditation), it dwells in every man's heart.
97	21	Thus the 'field,' knowledge (or meditation), and what should be known have been concisely declared; that faithful adherent of mine who makes himself acquainted therewith, becomes united to me in spirit.
98	1	When Vishnu had finished his speech, the goddess of the earth inclined her knees and her head before him and said:
98	2	'O Bhagavat! Four (out of the five) grosser elements are receiving their support from thee, and are constantly about thee: the ether, in the form of the shell; the air, in the form of the discus; the fire, in the form of the mace; and the water, in the form of the lotus. Now I also desire to attend upon thee, in my own shape, as the ground which Bhagavat's feet tread upon.'
98	3	Having been addressed thus by the goddess of the earth, Bhagavat answered, 'So be it.'
98	4	And the goddess of the earth, her desire having been gratified, did as she had said.

98	102	The goddess of the earth, after her desire had been gratified, and after she had thus praised(Vishnu) with a cheerful mind I addressed herself to the goddess (Lakshmî).
99	1	After having seen Sri (Lakshmî), the goddess of the earth, highly pleased, questioned (in the following manner) that goddess, who was stroking the feet of Vishnu, the god of the gods, who was shining with the splendour of her austerities, and whose face was radiant like melted gold.
99	2	'O charming lady! Thy hands are as beautiful as the expanded red lotus. Thou art holding the feet of him whose navel resembles the expanded red lotus. Thou art constantly residing in an abode resembling the expanded red lotus. Thy waist has the colour of the expanded red lotus.

99	7	The goddess of the earth having thus spoken to her, Lakshmî, standing by the side of the chief of the gods, enunciated the following answer: 'I am constantly at the side of the brilliant destroyer of Madhu, O goddess, who shinest like gold.
99	8	'But learn from me, where I reside (besides), O support of the world, from the instruction of him, whom I am constantly reflecting upon in my mind, and whom the virtuous call the husband of Srî, and from my own recollection.

99	21	'(I reside) in women who wear proper ornaments always, who are devoted to their husbands, whose speeches are kind, who keep up saving habits, who have sons, who keep their household utensils ingood order, and who are fond of offering domestic oblations.
99	22	'(I reside) in women who keep the house clean (by scouring it, plastering it with cow-dung, and the like), who keep their organs, of sense under control, who are not quarrelsome, contented, strictly, observing the law, and charitable; and I always reside in the destroyer of Madhu.
99	23	'I do not remain separated from Purushottama for a single moment.'
