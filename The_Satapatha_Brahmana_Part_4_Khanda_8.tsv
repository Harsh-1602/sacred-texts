1	1	1	He lays down the Prânabhritah (breath-holders) : now, the Prânabhritah being--the vitalairs, it is the vital airs he thereby bestows upon (Agni). He lays them down in the first layer;--that which is the first layer is the forepart (ground-part) of Agni: it is thus in front that he puts (into Agni) the vital airs, whence there are (in creatures) these (orifices of the) vital airs in front.
1	1	2	He lays them down by ten and ten, for there are ten vital airs; and even though 'ten-ten' may mean many, times, here they mean only ten. Five times he puts on ten (bricks) each time; for it is those five (kinds of sacrificial) animals he bestows, and there are ten vital airs in each .animal: upon all of them he thus bestows the vital airs. He lays down (the bricks) so as not to be separated from the animals: he thus bestows vital airs not separated from the animals. He lays them down on every side: on every side he thus bestows on them (orifices of) the vital airs.
1	1	3	And again why he lays down the Prânabhritah. From Pragâpati, when relaxed (by producing creatures), the vital airs departed. To them, having become deities, he spake, 'Come ye to me, return ye unto me that wherewith ye have gone out of me!'--'Well then, create thou that food which we will await here looking on!'--'Well then, let us both create!'--'So be it!'--So both the final airs and Pragâpati created that food, these Prânabhrit (bricks).
1	1	4	In front (of the altar) he lays down (ten bricks ,--the first) with , 'This one in front, the Existent,'--in front, doubtless, is Agni; and as to why he speaks of him (as being) 'in front,' it is because they take out the fire (from the Gârhapatya) towards the front, and attend on Agni towards the front . And as to why he says 'theexistent (bhuva),' Agni is indeed the existent, for it is through Agni that everything exists (bhû) here. Agni, indeed, having become the breath, remained in front : it is that very form  he now bestows (on Agni).
1	1	5	, 'His, the Existent's son, the Breath,'--from out of that form, fire, he (Pragâpati) fashioned the breath;--'Spring, the son of the breath,'--from out of the breath he fashioned the spring-season ;--'The Gâyatrî, the daughter of the Spring,'--from out of the spring-season he fashioned the Gâyatrî metre;--'From the Gâyatrî the Gâyatra,'--from out of the Gâyatrî metre he fashioned the Gâyatra  hymn-tune;--'From the Gâyatra the Upâmsu,'--from out of the Gâyatra hymn-tune he fashioned the Upâmsu-graha ;-- 'From the Upâmsu the Trivrit,'--from out of the Upâmsu-graha he fashioned the nine-versed hymn-form;--'From the Trivrit the Rathantara,'--from out of the Trivrit-stoma he fashioned the Rathantara-prishtha .
1	1	6	'The Rishi Vasishtha ,'--the Rishi Vasishtha, doubtless, is the breath: inasmuch as it is the chief (thing) therefore it is Vasishtha (the most excellent); or inasmuch as it abides (with living beings) as the best abider (vastri), therefore also it is Vasishtha.--'By thee, taken by Pragâpati,'--that is, 'by thee, created by Pragâpati,'--'I take breath for my descendants (and people)!'--therewith he introduced the breath from the front. Separately he lays down (these ten bricks): what separate desires there are in the breath, those he thereby lays into it. Only once he settles them : he thereby makes it one breath; but were he to settle them each separately, he assuredly would cut the' breath asunder. This brick is trivrit (threefold): the formula, the settling, and the sûdadohas , that is threefold, and threefold is Agni,--as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so much he lays down (on the altar) by so dying.
1	1	7	And on the right (south) side  with , 'This one on the right, the all-worker,'--the all-worker (visvakarman), doubtless, is this Vâyu (the wind) who blows here, for it is he that makes everything here; and because he speaks of him as (being) 'on the right,' therefore it is in the south that he blows most. Vâyu, indeed, having become the mind, remained in the right side (of the body): it is that form (part) he now bestows (on Agni).
1	1	8	'His, the all-worker's child, the Mind,'--from out of that (all-working) form, the wind, he fashioned the mind;--'the summer, the son of the mind,'--from out of the mind he fashioned the summer season ;--'the Trishtubh, the daughter of Summer,'--from out of the summer season he fashioned the Trishtubh metre;--'from the Trishtubh the Svâra tune,'--from out of the Trishtubh metre he created the Svâra hymn-tune ;--'fromthe Svâra the Antaryâma,'--from out of the Svâra-sâman he fashioned the Antaryâma-graha;--'from the Antaryâma the Pañkadasa,'--from out of the Antaryâma-cup he fashioned the fifteen-versed hymn-form;--'from the Pañkadasa the Brihat,'--from out of the Pañkadasa-stoma he fashioned the Brihat-prishtha.
1	1	9	'The Rishi Bharadvâga,'--the Rishi Bharadvâga, doubtless, is the mind;--'vâga' means 'food,' and he who possesses a mind, possesses (bharati) food, 'vâga;' therefore the Rishi Bharadvâga is the mind.--'By thee, taken by Pragâpati,'--that is, 'by thee, created by Pragâpati;'--'I take the mind for my descendants!'--therewith he introduced the mind from the right side. Separately he lays down (these ten bricks): what separate desires there are in the mind, those he thereby lays into it. Only once he settles them: he thereby makes it one mind; but were he to settle them each separately,he assuredly would cut asunder the mind. This brick is threefold: the meaning of this has been explained.
1	2	1	And at the back (western part of the altar), with , 'This one behind, the all-embracer;'--the all-embracer, doubtless, is yonder sun, for as soon as  he rises, all this embracing space comes into existence. And because he speaks of him as (being) 'behind,' therefore one sees him only when he goes towards the back (west). The Sun, indeed, having become the eye, remained behind: it is that form he now bestows (on Agni).
1	2	2	'His, the all-embracer's child, the Eye,'--from out of that (all-embracing) form, the Sun, he fashioned the eye;--'the rains, the offspring of the eye,'--from out of the eye he fashioned the rainy season;--'the Gagatî, the daughter of the rains,'--from out of the rainy season he fashioned the Gagatî metre;--'from the Gagatî the Riksama,'--from out of the Gagatî metre he fashioned the Riksama hymn-tune ;--'from the Riksamathe Sukra,'--from out of the Riksama-sâman he fashioned the Sukra-graha;--'from the Sukra the Saptadasa,'--from out of the Sukra cup he fashioned the seventeen-versed hymn-form;--'from the Saptadasa the Vairûpa,'--from out of the Saptadasa-stoma he fashioned the Vairûpa-prishtha.
1	2	3	'The Rishi Gamadagni,'--the Rishi Gamadagni, doubtless, is the eye: inasmuch as thereby the world of the living (gagat) sees and thinks, therefore the Rishi Gamadagni is the eye.--'By thee, taken by Pragâpati,'--that is, 'by thee, created by Pragâpati,'--'I take the eye for my descendants,' therewith he introduced the eye from behind. Separately he lays down (these ten bricks): what separate desires there are in the eye those he thereby lays into it. Only once he settles them: he thereby makes this eye one; but were he to settle them each separately, he assuredly would cut the eye asunder. This is a threefold brick: the meaning of this has been explained.
1	2	4	And on the left (upper, north) side, with , 'This, on the upper side, heaven,'--in the upper sphere, doubtless, are the regions (quarters); and as to why he speaks of them as being 'on the upper (left) side,' the regions, indeed,are above everything here. And as to why he says, 'heaven (or, the light),' the regions, indeed, are the heavenly world (or world of light). The regions, having become the ear, remained above: it is that form he now bestows (on Agni).
1	2	5	'Its, heaven's, child, the Ear,'--from out of that form, the regions, he fashioned the ear;--'the autumn, the daughter of the ear,'--from out of the ear he fashioned the autumn season;--'Anushtubh, the daughter of the autumn,'--from out of the autumn season he fashioned the Anushtubh metre;--'from the Anushtubh the Aida,'--from out of the Anushtubh metre he fashioned the Aida-sâman ;--'from the Aida the Manthin,'--from out of the Aida-sâman he fashioned the Manthin cup;--'from the Manthin the Ekavimsa,'--from out of the Manthi-graha he fashioned the twenty-one-versed hymn-form;--'from the Ekavimsa the Vairâga,'--from out of the Ekavimsa-stoma he fashioned the Vairâga-prishtha.
1	2	6	'The Rishi Visvâmitra,'--the Rishi Visvâmitra ('all-friend'), doubtless, is the ear: because therewith one hears in every direction, and because there is a friend (mitra) to it on every side, therefore the ear is the Rishi Visvâmitra.--'By thee, taken by Pragâpati,'--that is, 'by thee, erected by Pragâpati;'--'I take the ear for my descendants,' --therewith he introduced the ear from the left (or upper) side. Separately he lays down (these bricks): what separate desires there are in the ear, those he thereby lays into it. Only once he settles them: he thereby makes the ear one; but were he to settle them each separately, he assuredly would cut the ear asunder. This is a threefold brick: the meaning of this has been explained.
1	2	7	Then in the centre, with , 'This one, above, the mind,'--above, doubtless, is the moon; and as to why he speaks of him as (being) 'above,' the moon is indeed above; and as to why he says, 'the mind,' the mind (mati), doubtless, is speech, for by means of speech everything thinks (man) here . The moon, having become speech, remained above: it is that form he now bestows (on. Agni).
1	2	8	'Its, the mind's, daughter, Speech,'--from out of that form, the moon, he fashioned speech;--'Winter, the son of Speech,'--from out of speech he fashioned the winter season;--'Paṅkti, the daughter of Winter,'--from out of the winter season he fashioned the Paṅkti metre;--'from the Paṅkti the Nidhanavat,'--from out of the Paṅkti metre he fashioned the Nidhanavat-sâman ;--'from the Nidhanavat the Âgrayana,'--from out of the Nidhanavat-sâman he fashioned the Âgrayana cup;--'from the Âgrayana the Trinava and Trayastrimsa,'--from out of the Âgrayana-graha he fashioned the thrice-nine-versed and the three-and-thirty-versed hymn-forms;-- 'from the Trinava and Trayastrimsa the Sâkvara and Raivata,'--from out of the Trinava and Trayastrimsa-stomas he fashioned the Sâkvara and Raivata-prishthas .
1	2	9	'The Rishi Visvakarman,'--the Rishi Visvakarman ('the all-worker'), doubtless, is Speech, for by speech everything here is done: hence the Rishi Visvakarman is speech:--'By thee, taken by Pragâpati,'--that is, 'by thee, created by Pragâpati;'--'I take speech for my descendants,'--therewith he introduced speech from above. Separately he lays down (these bricks): what separate desires there are in speech, those he now lays into it. Only once he settles them: he thereby makes speech one; but were he to settle them each separately, he assuredly would cut speech asunder. This is a threefold brick: the meaning of this has been explained.
1	2	10	This, then, is that same food which both the vital airs and Pragâpati created: just so great indeed is the whole sacrifice, and the sacrifice is the food of the gods.
1	2	11	He lays them down by ten and ten,--of ten syllables consists the Virâg (metre), and the Virâg is all food: he thus bestows on him (Agni) the whole food. He puts them down on every side: on every side he thus bestows the whole food on him. And verily these same Virâg (verses) sustain those vital airs, and inasmuch as they sustain (bhri) the vital airs (prâna) they are called Prânabhritah.
1	3	1	As to this they say, 'What are the vital airs (prâna), and what the Prânabhritah?'--The vital airs are just the vital airs, and the Prânabhritah (holders of the vital airs) are the limbs, for the limbs do hold the vital airs. But, indeed, the vital airs are the vital airs, and the Prânabhrit is food, for food does uphold the vital airs.
1	3	2	As to this they say, 'How do all these (Prânabhrit-bricks) of him (Agni and the Sacrificer) come to be of Pragâpati's nature?'--Doubtless in that with all of them he says, 'By thee, taken by Pragâpati:' it is in this way, indeed, that they all come to be for him of Pragâpati's nature .
1	3	3	As to this they say, 'As they chant and recite for the cup when drawn, wherefore, then, does he put in verses and hymn-tunes  before (the drawing of) the cups?'--Doubtless, the completion of the sacrificial work has to be kept in view;--now with the opening hymn-verse the cup is drawn; and on the verse (rik) the tune (sâman) is sung: this means that he thereby puts in for him (Agni) both the verses and hymn-tunes before (the drawing of) the cups. And when after (the drawing of) the cups there are the chanting (of the Stotra) and the recitation (of the Sastra): this means that thereby he puts in for him both the stomas (hymn-forms) and the prishtha (sâmans) after (the drawing of) the cups .
1	3	4	As to this they say, 'If these three are done together--the soma-cup, the chant, and the recitation,--and he puts in only the soma-cup and the chant, how comes the recitation also in this case to be put (into the sacrificial work) for him ?' But, surely, what the chant is that is the recitation ; for on whatsoever (verses) they chant a tune, those same (verses) he (the Hotri) recites thereafter ; and in this way, indeed, the Sastra also comes in this case to be put in for him.
1	3	5	As to this they say, 'When he speaks first of three in the same way as of a father's son , how, then, does this correspond as regards the rile and sâman?' The sâman, doubtless, is the husband of the Rik; and hence were he also in their case to speak as of a father's son, it would be as if he spoke of him who is the husband, as of the son: therefore it corresponds as regards the rik and sâman. 'And why does he thrice carry on (the generation from father to son)?'--father, son, and grandson: it is these he thereby carries on; and therefore one and the same (man) offers (food) to them .
1	3	6	Those (bricks) which he lays down in front are the holders of the upward air (the breath, prâna); those behind are the eye-holders, the holders of the downward air (apâna) ; those on the right side are the mind-holders, the holders of the circulating air (vyâna); those on the left side are the ear-holders, the holders of the outward air (udâna); and those in the middle are the speech-holders, the holders of the pervading air (samâna).
1	3	7	Now the Karakâdhvaryus, indeed, lay down different (bricks) as holders of the downward air, of the circulating air, of the outward air, of the pervading air, as eye-holders, mind-holders, ear-holders, and speech-holders; but let him not do this, for they do what is excessive, and in this (our) way, indeed, all those forms are laid (into Agni).
1	3	8	Now, when he has laid down (the bricks) infront, he lays down those at the back (of the altar); for the upward air, becoming the downward air, passes along thus from the tips of the fingers; and the downward air, becoming the upward air, passes along thus from the tips of the toes: hence when, after laying down (the bricks) in front, he lays down those at the back, he thereby makes these two breathings continuous and connects them; whence these two breathings are continuous and connected.
1	3	9	And when he has laid down those on the right side, he lays down those on the left side; for the outward air, becoming the circulating air, passes along thus from the tips of the fingers ; and the circulating air, becoming the outward air, passes along thus from the tips of the fingers : hence when, after laying down (the bricks) on the right side, he lays down those on the left side, he thereby makes these two breathings continuous and connects them; whence these two breathings are continuous and connected.
1	3	10	And those (bricks) which he lays down in the centre are the vital air; he lays them down on the range of the two Retahsik (bricks), for the retahsik are the ribs, and the ribs are the middle: he thus lays the vital air into him (Agni and the Sacrificer) in the very middle (of the body). On every side he lays down (the central bricks) : in every part he thuslays vital air into him; and in the same way indeed that intestinal breath (channel) is turned all roundthe navel. He lays them down both lengthwise and crosswise , whence there are here in the body (channels of) the vital airs both lengthwise and crosswise. He lays them down touching each other: he thereby makes these vital airs continuous and connects them; whence these (channels of the) vital airs are continuous and connected.
1	4	1	Now some lay down (these bricks) so as to be in contact with the (gold) man, for he is the vital air, and him these (bricks) sustain; and because they sustain (bhri) the vital air (prâna), therefore they are called 'Prânabhritah.' Let him not do so: the vital air is indeed the same as that gold man, but this body of his extends to as far here as this fire (altar) has been marked out. Hence to whateverlimb of his these (breath-holders) were not to reach, that limb of his the vital air would not reach; and, to be sure, to whatever limb the vital air does not reach, that either dries up or withers away: let him therefore lay down these (bricks) so as to be in contact with the enclosing stones; and by those which he lays down in the middle this body of his is filled up, and they at least are not separated from him.
1	4	2	Here now they say, 'Whereas in (the formulas) "This one, in front, the existent--this one, on the right, the all-worker--this one, behind, the all-embracer--this, on the left, heaven--this one, above, the mind"--they (these bricks) are defined as exactly opposite the quarters, why, then, does he lay down these (bricks) in sidelong places ?' Well, the Prânabhritah are the vital airs; and if he were to place them exactly opposite the quarters, then this breath would only pass forward and backward; but inasmuch as he now lays down these (bricks) thus defined in sidelong places, therefore this breath, whilst being a backward and forward one, passes sideways along all the limbs and the whole body.
1	4	3	Now that Agni (the altar) is an animal, and (as such) he is even now made up whole and entire,--those (bricks) which he lays down in front are his fore-feet, and those behind are his thighs; and thosewhich he places in the middle are that body of his. He places these in the region of the two retahsik (bricks), for the retahsik are the ribs, and the ribs are the middle, and that body is in the middle (of the limbs). He places them all round, for that body extends all round.
1	4	4	Here now they say, 'Whereas in the first (four) sets he lays down a single stoma and a single prishtha each time, why, then, does he lay down here (in the centre) two stomas and two prishthas?' Well, this (central set) is his (Agni's) body: he thus makes the body (trunk) the best, the largest, the most vigorous of limbs ; whence that body is the best, the largest, and most vigorous of limbs.
1	4	5	Here now they say, 'How does that Agni of his become made up whole and entire in brick after brick?'--Well, the formula is the marrow, the brick the bone, the settling the flesh, the sûdadohas the skins, the formula of the purîsha (fillings of earth) the hair, and the purîsha the food: and thus indeed that Agni of his becomes made up whole and entire in brick after brick.
1	4	6	That Agni is possessed of all vital power: verily, whosoever knows that Agni to be possessed of all vital power (âyus), attains his full measure of life (âyus).
1	4	7	Now, then, as to the contraction and expansion (of the body). Now some cause the built (altar) in this way  to be possessed of (the power of) contraction and expansion: that Agni indeed is an animal;and when an animal contracts and expands its limbs, it develops strength by them.
1	4	8	'Thou art Samvatsara,--thou art Parivatsara,--thou art Idâvatsara,--thou art Idvatsara,--thou art Vatsara,--May thy dawns prosper !--may thy days and nights prosper!--may thy half-months prosper!--may thy months prosper!--may thy seasons prosper!--may thy year prosper!--For going and coming contract and expand thyself!--Of Eagle-build thou art: by that deity, Aṅgiras-like, lie thou steady !'
1	4	9	Sâtyâyani also once said, 'Some one heard (the sound)  of the cracking wings of the (altar)-when touched with this (formula): let him therefore by all means touch it therewith!'
1	4	10	And Svargit Nâgnagita or Nagnagit, the Gândhâra, once said, 'Contraction and expansion surely are the breath, for in whatever part of the body there is breath that it both contracts and expands; let him breathe upon it from outside when completely built: he thereby lays breath, the (power of) contraction and expansion, into it, and so it contracts and expands.' But indeed what he there said as to that contraction and expansion, it was only one of the princely order who said it; and assuredly were they to breathe upon it from outside a hundredtimes, or a thousand times, they could not lay breath into it. Whatever breath there is in the (main) body that alone is the breath: hence when he lays down the Prânabhritah (breath-holders), he thereby lays breath, the (power of) contraction and expansion, into it; and so it contracts and expands. He then lays down two Lokamprinâ (bricks) in that corner : the meaning of them (will be explained) further on . He throws loose earth (on the layer): the meaning of this (will be explained) further on .
2	1	1	He lays down the second layer. For now the gods, having laid down the first layer, mounted it. But, indeed, the first layer is this (terrestrial) world: it is this same world which, when completed, they mounted.
2	1	2	They spake, 'Meditate ye!'--whereby, doubtless, they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer! Seek ye (to build) from hence upwards!' Whilst meditating, they saw this second layer: what there is above the earth, and on this side of the atmosphere, that world was to their mind, as it were, unfirm and unsettled.
2	1	3	They said to the Asvins, 'Ye two are Brahmans and physicians: lay ye down for us this second layer!'--'What will therefrom accrue unto us?--'Ye two shall be the Adhvaryus at this our Agnikityâ.'--'So be it!'--The Asvins laid down for them that second layer: whence they say, 'The Asvins are the Adhvaryus of the gods.'
2	1	4	He lays down , 'Thou art firmly-founded, firmly-seated, firm!' for what is steady and settled, that is firm. Now that world was to their minds, as it were, unfirm and unsettled: having thereby made it firm, steady, they (the Asvins) went on laying down (bricks).--'Seat thee fitly in thy firm seat!'--that is, 'Seat thee fitly in thy steady seat;'--'enjoying the first appearance of the Ukhya,'--the Ukhya, doubtless, is this Agni; and that first layer is indeed his first appearance: thus, 'enjoying that.'--'May the Asvins, the Adhvaryus, settle you here!' for the Asvins, as Adhvaryus, did lay down (this brick).
2	1	5	, 'Nest-like, fat, wise,'--a nest, as it were, is indeed the second layer ;--'seat thee in the soft seat of the earth!'--the second layer, no doubt, is the earth: thus, 'Sit on her pleasant seat!'--'May the Rudras, the Vasus sing thy praises!'--that is, 'May those deities sing thy praises!'--'Replenish them, O Brahman, for happiness!'--that is, 'Favour them, O Brahman, with a view to happiness.'--'May the Asvins, the Adhvaryus, settle thee here!' for the Asvins, as Adhvaryus, did lay down (this brick).
2	1	6	, 'By thine own powers seat thee here, a holder of powers,'--that is, 'By thy own energy seat thee here;'--'in the gods’ favour for high joy!' that is, 'for the favour of the gods, for great joy ;"--'be thou kind, as a father to his son!'--that is, 'As a father is gentle, kind, to his son, so be thou kind!'--'rest thou readily accessible with thy form!'--the form, doubtless, is the body: thus, 'rest thou with readily accessible body!'--'May the Asvins, the Adhvaryus, settle thee here!' for the Asvins, as Adhvaryus, did lay down (this brick).
2	1	7	, 'Thou art the earth's soil-cover,'--the first layer, doubtless, is the earth, and this, the second (layer) is, as it were, its soil-cover (purîsha)--'her sap , in truth,'--that is, 'her essence, in truth,'--'May the All-gods sing thy praises!'--that is, 'May all the gods sing thy praises!'--'Seat thee here, laden with stomas, and rich in fat!'--whatever hymn-forms he will be spreading (constructing) thereon by them this (brick) is laden with stomas ;--'Gain for us by sacrifice wealth (dravinâ, pl.) with offspring (adj. sing.)!'--that is, 'Gain for us, by sacrifice, wealth (dravinam, sing.) with offspring!'--'May the Asvins, the Adhvaryus, settle thee here!' for the Asvins, as Adhvaryus, did lay down (this brick).
2	1	8	These (bricks) are those regions (quarters); he places them on the range of the two retahsik (bricks), for the retahsik are these two (worlds): he thereby places the regions within these two (worlds), whence there are regions within these two (worlds). He lays down (these bricks) in every direction: he thus places the regions in all (the four) directions, whence the regions are in all directions.  on all sides so as to face each other : he therebymakes the regions on all sides face each other, and hence the regions on all sides face each other. He lays (the bricks) down separately, settles them separately, and pronounces the sûdadohas over them separately, for separate are the regions.
2	1	9	He then lays down the fifth regional (or Âsvinî brick). Now that region is the one above ; and that same region above, doubtless, is yonder sun: it is yonder sun he thus places thereon. He places this (brick) within the southern regional one : he thus places yonder sun within the southern region, and therefore he moves within the southern region.
2	1	10	, 'I settle thee upon the back of Aditi,'--Aditi doubtless is this (earth): it is upon her, as a foundation, that he thus founds him (Agni);--'the holderof the air, the supporter of the regions, the ruler of beings,'--for he (the sun) is indeed the holder of the air, the supporter of the regions, and the ruler of beings;--'thou art the wave, the drop, of water,'--the wave, doubtless, means the essence;--'Visvakarman is thy Rishi!'--Visvakarman (the all-shaper), doubtless, is Pragâpati: thus, 'Thou art fashioned by Pragâpati.'--'May the Asvins, the Adhvaryus, settle thee here!' for the Asvins, as Adhvaryus, did lay down (this brick).
2	1	11	Now as to why he lays down these Âsvinî (bricks). When Pragâpati had become relaxed (disjointed), the deities took him and went away in different directions. Now what part of him there was above the feet and below the waist, that part of him the two Asvins took and kept going away from him.
2	1	12	He said to them, 'Come to me and restore unto me that wherewith ye have gone away from me!'--'What will accrue to us therefrom?'--'That part of my body shall be sacred unto you!'--'So be it!' so the Asvins restored that (part) unto him.
2	1	13	Now these five Âsvinî (bricks) are that same (part) of his (Agni's) body; and when he now puts them into this (layer of the altar), he thereby restores to him what (part) of his body these (bricks) are: that is why he puts them into this (layer).
2	1	14	'Thou art firmly founded, firmly seated, firm,' he says, for whatsoever is steady and established that is firm. Now that part of his (Pragâpati-Agni's) body was, as it were, unsteady, unfirm; and having made it steady and firm they (the Asvins) restored it to him.
2	1	15	'Nestlike, fat, wise,' he says, for this indeedis as a nest for his body.--'By thine own powers seat thee here, a holder of powers,' he says, for they did make that (part) of him powerful.--'Thou art the Earth's soil-cover,' he says, for that (lower part) of his body is, as it were, in connection with the soil-cover. At the range of the Retahsik (he places the bricks),--the Retahsik are the ribs, for level with the ribs, as it were, is that (part) of his body. He places them on every side, for on every side the Asvins restored that (part) of his (Pragâpati's) body.
2	1	16	He then lays down two Ritavyâ  (seasonal bricks);--these two, the Ritavyâ, are the seasons (ritu): it is the seasons he thus bestows thereon. , 'Sukra and Suki, the two summer-seasons;'--these are the names of these two: it is with their names that he thus lays them down. There are two bricks, for a season consists of two months. He settles them once only: he thereby makes (the two months) one season.
2	1	17	And as to why he lays down these two in this (layer):--this Agni (fire-altar) is the year, and the year is these worlds. Now that part of him which is above the earth and below the atmosphere, is this second layer; and that same part of him (Agni, the year,) is the summer season. And when he lays down those two in this (layer), he thereby restores to him (Agni) that part of his body which these two are: this is why he lays down these two (bricks) in this (layer).
2	1	18	And, again, as to why he lays down these two in this (layer). This fire-altar is Pragâpati, and Pragâpati is the year. Now that (part) of him which is above the feet and below the waist is this second layer; and that same part of him is the summer season. Thus when he lays down those two in this (layer), he thereby restores to him that (part) of his body which these two ale: this is why he lays down these two (bricks) in this (layer).
2	2	1	He then lays down the Vaisvadevî (All-gods’ bricks). For this second layer is that one which the Asvins at that time laid down for them (the gods); and by laying it down they became everything here whatsoever there is here.
2	2	2	The gods spake, 'The Asvins have become everything here: think ye upon this as to how we also may share in it!' They said, 'Meditate ye (kit)!' whereby, no doubt, they meant to say, Seek ye a layer (kiti)! seek ye in what way we also may share in it!' whilst meditating, they saw these Vaisvadevî (All-gods’) bricks.
2	2	3	They said, 'The Asvins have become everything here: with the help of the Asvins let us lay down (bricks) along with the Asvins’ layer!' With the help of the Asvins they accordingly laid down (bricks) along with the Asvins’ layer, whence they call this the Asvins’ layer. Hence the end of these (bricks) is the same as that of the former ones; for they laid them down with the help of the Asvins along with the Asvins’ layer.
2	2	4	And, again, as to why he lays down the All-gods’ (bricks). These indeed are those same All-gods who saw this second layer, and who came nigh with that life-sap: it is them he thereby bestows, that is, all these creatures. He lays them down in the range of the Retahsik; for the Retahsik are these two (heaven and earth): within these two (worlds) he thus places creatures; whence there are creatures within these two (worlds). He places (bricks) on every side: he thus places creatures everywhere, whence there are creatures everywhere. He places them alongside of the regional ones : he thus places creatures in the regions (quarters); whence there are creatures in all the (four) quarters.
2	2	5	And, again, as to why he lays down the All-gods’ (bricks). When Pragâpati had become relaxed, all creatures went forth from the midst of him, from that birth-place of theirs. When that (central part) of his body had been restored, they entered him.
2	2	6	Now the Pragâpati who become relaxed is this very Agni (fire-altar) that is now being built up; and the creatures who went forth from the midst of him are these same All-gods’ bricks; and when he lays these down, he causes those creatures, which went forth from the midst of him, to enter him. In the range of the Retahsik (he places the Vaisvadevî bricks), for the Retahsik are the ribs, and the ribsare the middle: he thus causes the creatures to enter him in the very middle. He places them on all sides: on all sides he thus causes the creatures to enter him.
2	2	7	And, again, as to why he lays down the Vaisvadevî (bricks). At that time, when that (part) of his body had been restored, Pragâpati desired, 'May I create creatures, may I be reproduced!' Having entered into union with the seasons, the waters, the vital airs, the year, and the Asvins, he produced these creatures; and in like manner does this Sacrificer, by entering into union with those deities, now produce these creatures. Hence with all (of these bricks, the word) sagush ('in union with') recurs.
2	2	8	, 'In union with the seasons,'--he thereby produced the seasons, and having entered into union with the seasons he produced (creatures);--'in union with the ranges,'--the ranges, doubtless, are the waters, for by water everything is ranged (distributed or produced) here: having entered into union with the waters he produced (creatures);--'in union with the gods,'--he thereby produced the gods,--those who are called 'gods ;'--'in union with the life-sustaining gods,'--the life-sustaining gods, doubtless, are the vital airs, for by the vital airs everything living here is sustained; or, the life-sustaining gods are the metres, for by the metres (sacred writ) everything living is sustained here; having entered into union with the vital airs he produced creatures;-- 'for Agni Vaisvânara,'--Agni Vaisvânara ('belonging to all men'), doubtless, is the year: having entered into union with the year he produced creatures;--'May the Asvins, the Adhvaryus, settle thee here!'--having entered into union with the Asvins he produced creatures.
2	2	9	'In union with the Vasus,' he says on the right side: he thereby produced the Vasus;--'in union with the Rudras,' he says at the back: he thereby produced the Rudras;--'in union with the Âdityas,' he says on the left side: he thereby produced the Âdityas;--'in union with the All-gods,' he says upwards: he thereby produced the All-gods. These (bricks) have the same beginning and end, but are different in the middle: as to their having the same beginning and end, it is because having become united with the deities in front and behind, he produced creatures; and as to their being different in the middle, it is that each time he produced different creatures from within him.
2	3	1	He then lays down the Prânabhrit (bricks). For at that time the gods said, 'Meditate ye!' whereby, doubtless, they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer!' Whilst meditating, they saw even that layer, the wind: they put it into that (fire-altar), and in like manner does he (the priest) now put it therein.
2	3	2	He lays down the Prânabhrits,--wind, doubtless, is breath: it is wind (air) he thus bestows Upon him (Agni). On the range of the Retahsik (they are placed); for the Retahsik are these two (worlds): it is within these two (worlds) that he thus places the wind; whence there is wind within these two (worlds). He places them on every side: he thus places wind on all sides, whence the wind is everywhere.  on every side to run in the same direction : he thus makes the wind everywhere (to blow) in the same direction, whence, having become united, it blows from all quarters in the same direction. He lays them down alongside of the regional (bricks) : he thereby places the wind in the regions, whence there is wind in all the regions.
2	3	3	And, again, as to why he lays down the Prânabhrits;--it is that he thereby bestows vital airs on these creatures. He places them so as not to be separated from the Vaisvadevîs: he thereby bestows vital airs not separated from the creatures. , 'Preserve mine up-breathing! Preserve my down-breathing! Preserve my through-breathing! Make mine eye shine far and wide! Make mine ear resound!' He thereby bestows on them properly constituted vital airs.
2	3	4	He then lays down the Apasyâ (bricks). For the gods, at that time, spake, 'Meditate ye!' whereby, doubtless, they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer!' Whilst meditating, they saw even that layer, rain:they put it into that (fire-altar) and in like manner does he now put it therein.
2	3	5	He put on the Apasyâs; for rain is water (ap); it is rain he thereby puts into it (the altar; or into him, Agni). On the range of the Retahsik (he places them), for, the Retahsik being these two (worlds), it is on these two (worlds) that he thereby bestows rain, whence it rains therein. He places them on every side: he thus puts rain everywhere, whence it rains everywhere.  so as everywhere to run in the same direction : he thereby bestows rain (falling) everywhere in the same direction, whence the rain falls everywhere, and from all quarters, in the same direction. He places them alongside of those referring to the wind : he thereby puts rain into the wind, whence rain follows to whatever quarter the wind goes.
2	3	6	And, again, as to why he lays down Apasyâs,--he thereby puts water into the vital airs. He places them so as not to be separated from the Prânabhrits: he thus places the water so as not to be separate from the vital airs. Moreover, water is food: he thus introduces food not separated from (the channels of) the vital airs. , 'Make the waters swell! Quicken the plants! Bless thou the two-footed! Protect the four-footed! Draw thou rain from the sky!' He thereby puts water that is made fit, into those (vital airs).
2	3	7	He then lays down the Khandasyâ  (bricks) for the gods, at that time, spake, 'Meditate ye!' whereby, doubtless, they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer!' Whilst meditating, they saw even that layer, cattle (or beasts): they put it therein, and, in like manner, does he now put it therein.
2	3	8	He lays down the Khandasyâs; for the metres (khandas) are cattle: it is cattle he thus puts into it (or, bestows on him, Agni). On every side (he places them): he thereby places cattle (or beasts) everywhere, whence there are cattle everywhere. He places them alongside of the Apasyâs: he thus establishes the cattle on (or, near) water, whence cattle thrive when it rains.
2	3	9	And, again, as to why he lays down Khandasyâs. When Pragâpati was relaxed, the cattle, having become metres, went from him. Gâyatrî, having become a metre, overtook them by dint of her vigour; and as to how Gâyatrî overtook them, it is that this is the quickest (shortest) metre. And so Pragâpati, in the form of that (Gâyatrî), by dint of his vigour, overtook those cattle.
2	3	10	, 'The head is vigour,'--Pragâpati, doubtless, is the head: it is he that became vigour;--'Pragâpati the metre,'--Pragâpati indeed became a metre.
2	3	11	'The Kshatra is vigour,'--the Kshatra, doubtless, is Pragâpati, it is he that became vigour;--'the pleasure-giving metre,'--what is undefinedthat is pleasure-giving; and Pragâpati is undefined, and Pragâpati indeed became a metre.
2	3	12	'Support is vigour,'--the support, doubtless, is Pragâpati: it is he that became vigour;--'the over-lord the metre,'--the over-lord, doubtless, is Pragâpati, and Pragâpati indeed became a metre.
2	3	13	'The All-worker is vigour,'--the All-worker, doubtless, is Pragâpati: it is he that became vigour;--'the highest lord the metre,'--Pragâpati, the highest lord, doubtless, is the waters, for they (the waters of heaven) are in the highest place: Pragâpati, the highest lord, indeed became a metre.
2	3	14	These then are four kinds of vigour, and four metres; this (makes) eight,--the Gâyatrî consists of eight syllables: this, assuredly, is that same Gâyatrî in the form of which Pragâpati then, by his vigour, overtook those cattle; whence they say of worn-out cattle that they are overtaken by vigour (or, age), and hence (the word) 'vigour' recurs with all (these bricks). And those cattle which went away from him (Pragâpati) are these fifteen other (formulas): the cattle are a thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt is fifteenfold: whence he who possesses cattle, drives off the evildoer, for the thunderbolt drives off the evildoer for him. And in whatever direction, therefore, the possessor of cattle goes, that he finds torn up by the thunderbolt.
2	4	1	'The he-goat is vigour ,'--the he-goat he overtook by his vigour;--'gapless the metre,'--the gapless metre, doubtless, is the Ekapadâ: in the form of Ekapadâ (metre) the goats indeed went forth (from Pragâpati).
2	4	2	'The ram is vigour,'--the ram he overtook by his vigour;--'ample the metre,'--the ample metre, doubtless, is the Dvipadâ: in the form of the Dvipadâ the sheep indeed went forth.
2	4	3	'Man is vigour,'--the man he overtook by his vigour;--'slow the metre,'--the slow metre, doubtless, is the Paṅkti: in the form of the Paṅkti the men indeed went forth.
2	4	4	'The tiger is vigour,'--the tiger he overtook by his vigour;--'unassailable the metre,'--the unassailable metre, doubtless, is the Virâg, for the Virâg is food, and food is unassailable; in the form of the Virâg the tigers indeed went forth.
2	4	5	'The lion is vigour,'--the lion he overtook by his vigour;--'the covering the metre,'--the covering metre, doubtless, is the Atikkhandas, for that covers (includes) all metres: in the form of the Atikkhandas the lions indeed went forth. And so he places undefined metres along with defined beasts.
2	4	6	'The ox is vigour,'--the ox he overtook by his vigour;--'the Brihatî the metre,'--in the form of the Brihatî the oxen indeed went forth.
2	4	7	'The bull is vigour,'--the bull he overtook by his vigour;--'the Kakubh the metre,'--in the form of the Kakubh the bulls indeed went forth.
2	4	8	'The steer is vigour,'--the steer he overtook by his vigour;--'the Satobrihatî the metre,'--in the form of the Satobrihatî the steers indeed went forth.
2	4	9	'The bullock is vigour,'--the bullock he overtook by his vigour;--'the Paṅkti the metre,'--in the form of the Paṅkti the bullocks indeed went forth.
2	4	10	'The milch cow is vigour,'--the milch cow he overtook by his vigour;--'the Gagatî the metre,'--in the form of the Gagatî the milch cows indeed went forth.
2	4	11	'The calf of eighteen months is vigour,'--the calf of eighteen months he overtook by his vigour;--'the Trishtubh the metre,'--in the form of the Trishtubh the calves of eighteen months indeed went forth.
2	4	12	'The two-year-old bull is vigour,'--the two-year-old bull he overtook by his vigour;--'the Virâg the metre,'--in the form of the Virâg the two-year-old kine indeed went forth.
2	4	13	'The bull of two years and a half is vigour,'--the bull of two years and a half he overtook by his vigour;--'the Gâyatrî the metre,'--in the form of the Gâyatrî the kine of two years and a half indeed went forth.
2	4	14	'The three-year-old bull is vigour,'--the three-year-old bull he overtook by his vigour;--'the Ushnih the metre,'--in the form of the Ushnih the three-year-old kine indeed went forth.
2	4	15	'The four-year-old bull is vigour,'--the four-year-old bull he overtook by his vigour;--'the Anushtubh the metre,'--in the form of the Anushtubh the four-year-old kine indeed went forth.
2	4	16	These then are those very beasts which Pragâpati overtook by his vigour. The animal he (the priest) mentions first, then vigour, then themetre, for having hemmed them in with vigour and the metre, he put them into himself, and made them his own; and in like manner does he (the sacrificer) now hem them in with vigour and the metre, and put them into himself, and make them his own.
2	4	17	Now that animal is the same as Agni: (as such) he is even now made up whole and entire. Those (bricks) which he places in front are his head; those on the right and left sides are his body, and those behind his tail.
2	4	18	He first lays down those in front, for of an animal that is born the head is born first. Having then laid down those on the right (south) side, he lays down those on the left (north) side, thinking, 'Together with its sides this body shall be born.' Then those behind, for of (the animal) that is born the tail is born last.
2	4	19	The metres which are longest, and the animals which are biggest, he puts in the middle: he thus makes the animal biggest towards the middle; whence the animal is biggest towards the middle. And the animals which are the strongest he puts on the right side: he thus makes the right side of an animal the stronger; whence the right side of an animal is the stronger.
2	4	20	The fore and hind parts he makes smallest; for inasmuch as those (bricks in front) are only four in number , thereby they are the smallest; and inasmuch as here (at the back) he puts the smallest animals, thereby these are the smallest: he thus makes the fore and hind parts of an animal the smallest, whence the fore and hind parts of an animalare the smallest; and hence the animal rises and sits down by its fore and hind parts. He then lays down two Lokamprinâ (bricks) in that corner : the significance of them (will be explained) further on . He throws loose earth on the layer: the significance of this (will be explained) further on .
3	1	1	He lays down the third layer. For the gods, having laid down the second layer, now ascended it; but, indeed, they thereby completed and ascended to what is above the earth and below the atmosphere.
3	1	2	They spate, 'Meditate ye!' whereby, indeed, they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer! Seek ye (to build) upwards from hence!' Whilst meditating, they saw the great third layer, even the air: that world pleased them.
3	1	3	They said to Indra and Agni, 'Lay ye down for us this third layer!'--'What will accrue unto us therefrom? Ye two shall be the best of us!'--'So be it!' Accordingly Indra and Agni laid down for them that third layer; and hence people say, 'Indra and Agni are the best of gods.'
3	1	4	He accordingly lays it down by means of Indra and Agni, and settles it by means of Visvakarman ,for indeed Indra and Agni, as well as Visvakarman, saw this third layer: this is why he lays it down by means of Indra and Agni, and settles it by means of Visvakarman.
3	1	5	And, again, as to why he lays it down by means of Indra and Agni, and settles it by means of Visvakarman. When Pragâpati had become relaxed (disjointed), the deities took him and went off in different directions. Indra and Agni, and Visvakarman took his middle part, and kept going away from him.
3	1	6	He said to them, 'Come ye to me and restore ye to me wherewith ye are going from me!'--'What will accrue unto us therefrom?'--'That (part) of my body shall be sacred unto you!'--'So be it!' So Indra and Agni, and Visvakarman restored that (part) unto him.
3	1	7	Now that central Svayam-âtrinnâ (naturally-perforated brick)  is that very (part) of his body;--when he now lays down that (brick), he thereby restores to him that (part) of his (Pragâpati's) body which this (brick represents): this is why he now lays down that (brick).
3	1	8	, 'O Indra and Agni, make ye fast the brick so as not to shake!' as the text so the sense;--'with thy back thou forcest asunder the earth, and the sky, and the air;' for with its back this (brick) indeed forces asunder the earth, and the sky, and the air.
3	1	9	, 'May Visvakarman settlethee,' for Visvakarman saw this third layer;--'on the back of the air, thee the wide, the broad one!' for this (brick) indeed is the wide and broad back of the air;--'support thou the air, make fast the air, injure not the air!' that is, 'support thou thine own self (body), make fast thine own self, injure not thine own self!'
3	1	10	'For all up-breathing, and dawn-breathing, and through-breathing, and out-breathing!' for the naturally-perforated (brick) is the vital air, and the vital air serves for everything here;--'for a resting-place and moving-place!' for the naturally-perforated (brick) is these worlds, and these worlds are indeed a resting-place and a moving-place;--'May Vâyu shelter thee!' that is, 'May Vâyu protect thee!'--'with grand prosperity!' that is, 'with great prosperity;'--'with most auspicious protection!'--that is, with what protection is most auspicious.' Having settled it , he pronounces the Sûdadohas  over it; the meaning of this has been explained. He then sings a sâman: the meaning of this (will be explained) further on .
3	1	11	He then lays down (five) Disyâ (regional bricks) . Now the regional ones, doubtless, arethe regions: it is the regions he thus bestows (on the air-world). And these are those same regions not separated (from the air) wherewith Vâyu on that occasion  stepped nigh: it is them he thereby bestows. But prior to these same (bricks) he lays down  both the bunch of Darbha grass and the clod-bricks; and these (disyâs) being yonder sun , he thus places yonder sun over the regions, and builds him up upon (or, in) the regions. But were these (laid down) at the same time (as the bunch of grass and the clod-bricks), they would be outside (of the altar); and outside of the womb (foundation), indeed, is that sacrificial work regarding the fire-altar which is done prior to the lotus-leaf . When henow brings and lays down these (bricks), he thereby establishes them in the womb, on the lotus-leaf, and thus these (bricks) are not outside (the fire-altar). He lays them down so as not to be separated  from the naturally-perforated one; for the middle  naturally-perforated one is the air: he thus places the regions so as not to be separate from the air. Subsequently  (to the central brick he lays them down): subsequently to the air he thus sets up the regions. In all (four) directions he places them: he thus places the regions (quarters) in all directions, whence the regions are in all (four) directions.  on all sides so as to face each other: he thereby makes the regions on all sides face each other, and hence the regions on all sides face each other .
3	1	12	And, again, as to why he lays down the regionals. The regions, doubtless, are the metres--the eastern region being the Gâyatrî, the southern the Trishtubh, the western the Gagatî, the northern the Anushtubh, and the upper region the Paṅkti;--and the metres are animals , and the middlemost layer is the air: he thus places animals in the air,and hence there are animals that have their abode in the air .
3	1	13	And, again, as to why he lays down the regionals. The regions, doubtless, are the metres, and the metres are animals, and animals are food, and the middlemost layer is the middle: he thus puts food in the middle (of the body). He places them so as not to be separated (by special bricks) from the naturally-perforated one; for the naturally-perforated one is the vital air: he thus places the food so as not to be separated from the vital air. Subsequently (to the central brick he lays them down): subsequently to (or upon) the vital air he thus places food. On the range of the Retahsik (he places them): the Retahsik being the ribs, and the ribs being the middle (of the body), he thus places the food in the middle of this (Agni's body). On every side he places them: from everywhere he thus supplies him with food.
3	1	14	, 'Thou art the queen, the Eastern region! Thou art the far-ruler, the Southern region! Thou art the all-ruler, the Western region! Thou art the self-ruler, the Northern region! Thou art the supreme ruler, the Great region!' these are their names: he thus lays them down whilst naming them. Separately he lays them down, separately he settles them, and separately he pronounces the Sûdadohas over them, for separate are the regions.
3	2	1	He then lays down a Visvagyotis (all-light brick). Now the middle Visvagyotis is Vâyu , for Vâyu (the wind) is all the light in the air-world: it is Vâyu he thus places therein. He places it so as not to be separated from the regional (bricks): he thus places Vâyu in the regions, and hence there is wind in all the regions.
3	2	2	And, again, as to why he lays down the Visvagyotis,--the Visvagyotis, doubtless, is offspring (or creatures), for offspring indeed is all the light: he thus lays generative power (into that world). He places it so as not to be separated from the regional ones : he thus places creatures in the regions, and hence there are creatures in all the regions.
3	2	3	, 'May Visvakarman settle thee!' for Visvakarman saw this third layer ;--'on the back of the air, thee the brilliant one!' for on the back of the air that brilliant Vâyu indeed is.
3	2	4	'For all up-breathing, down-breathing, through-breathing,'--for the Visvagyotis is breath,and breath indeed is (necessary) for this entire universe;--'give all the light!'--that is, 'give the whole light;'--'Vâyu is thine over-lord,'--it is Vâyu he thus makes the over-lord of that (layer and the air-world). Having settled it, he pronounces the Sûdadohas over it: the significance of this has been explained.
3	2	5	He then lays down two Ritavyâ (seasonal  bricks);--the two seasonal ones being the same as the seasons, it is the seasons he thus places therein., 'Nabha and Nabhasya, the two rainy seasons,' these are the names of those two (bricks): it is by their names he thus lays them down. There are two (such) bricks, for a season consists of two months. He settles them once only: he thereby makes (the two months) one season. He places them on avakâ-plants and covers themwith avakâ-plants ; for avakâ-plants mean water he thus bestows water on that season, whence it rains most abundantly in that season.
3	2	6	Then the two upper ones, with , 'Isha and Ûrga, the two autumnal seasons,'--these are the names of those two (bricks): it is by their names he thus lays them down. There are two (such) bricks, for a season consists of two months. He settles them only once: he thereby makes (the two months) one season. He places them on avakâ-plants, for the avakâ-plants mean water: he thus bestows water before that season, whence it rains before that season. He does not cover them afterwards, whence it does not likewise rain after (that season).
3	2	7	And as to why he places these (four bricks) in this (layer),--this fire-altar is the year, and the year is the same as these worlds, and the middlemost layer is the air (-world) thereof; and the rainy season and autumn are the air (-world) thereof: hence when he places them in this (layer), he thereby restores to him (Agni) what (part) of his body these (formed),--this is why he places them in this (layer).
3	2	8	And, again, as to why he places them in this (layer),--this Agni (the fire-altar) is Pragâpati, and Pragâpati is the year. Now the middlemost layer is the middle of this (altar), and the rainy season and the autumn are the middle of that (year): hence when he places them in this (layer), he thereby restores to him (Agni-Pragâpati) what part of hisbody these (formed),--this is why he places them in this (layer).
3	2	9	There are here four seasonal (bricks) he lays down in the middlemost layer; and two in each of the other layers,--animals (cattle) are four-footed, and the middlemost layer is the air: he thus places animals in the air, and hence there are animals that have their abode in the air.
3	2	10	And, again, why there are four,--animals are four-footed, and animals are food; and the middle-most layer is the middle (of Agni's body): he thus puts food in the middle.
3	2	11	And, again, why there are four,--'antariksha' (air) consists of four syllables, and the other layers (kiti) consist of two syllables; hence as much as the air consists of, so much he makes it in laying it down.
3	2	12	And, again, why there are four,--this Agni (altar), doubtless, is an animal: he thus makes the animal biggest towards the middle; whence an animal is biggest towards the middle.
3	2	13	There are here four Ritavyâs, the Visvagyotis being the fifth, and five Disyâs,--this makes ten: the Virâg consists of ten syllables, and the Virâg is food, and the middlemost layer is the middle;--he thus puts food in the middle (of the body). He lays them down so as not to be separated from the naturally-perforated one , for the naturally-perforated one is the vital air: he thus places the food so as not to be separated from the vital air. Subsequently (to the central brick) he lays them down: subsequentlyto (or upon) the vital air he thus places food.
3	2	14	He then lays down the Prânabhrit  (bricks);--the Prânabhrits (breath-holders), doubtless, are the vital airs: it is the vital airs he thus lays into (Agni's body). There are ten of them, for there are ten vital airs. He places them in the forepart (of the altar),--for there are these vital airs in front,--with , 'Protect my vital strength! protect mine up-breathing! protect my down-breathing! protect my through-breathing! protect mine eye! protect mine ear! increase my speech! animate my mind! protect my soul (or body)! give me light!'--He lays them down so as not to be separated from the seasonal ones, for the vital air is wind: he thus establishes the wind in the seasons.
3	3	1	He then lays down the Khandasyâ  (metres’ bricks). Now the metres are cattle, and the middle-most layer is the air: he thus places cattle in the air, whence cattle have their abode in the air.
3	3	2	And, again, as to why he lays down Khandasyâs,--the metres are cattle, and cattle are food, and the middlemost layer is the middle (of Agni, the altar): he thus places food in the middle (of Agni's body).
3	3	3	He lays them down by twelves,--for the Gagatî consists of twelve syllables, and the Gagatî is cattle, and the middlemost layer is the air: he thus places cattle in the air, whence cattle have their abode in the air.
3	3	4	And, again, why (he lays them down) by twelves,--the Gagatî consists of twelve syllables, and the Gagatî is cattle, and cattle is food, and the middlemost layer is the middle: he thus places food in the middle. He places them so as not to be separated from the Prânabhrits: he thus places the food so as not to be separated from the vital airs subsequently (to them he places them): he thus bestows food after (bestowing) the vital airs.
3	3	5	, 'The metre Measure;'--the measure (mâ), doubtless, is this (terrestrial) world, for this world is, as it were, measured (mita);--'the metre Fore-measure!'--the fore-measure (pramâ), doubtless, is the air-world, for the air-world is, as it were, measured forward from this world;--'The metre Countermeasure,'--the counter-measure (pratimâ), doubtless, is yonder (heavenly) world, for yonder world is, as it were, counter-measured  in the air;--'The metre Asrîvayas,'--'asrîvayas,' doubtless, is food: whatever food there is in these worlds that is 'asrîvayas.' Or, whatever food (anna) flows (sravati) from theseworlds that is 'asrîvayas.' Hereafter, now, he puts down only defined metres.
3	3	6	'The Paṅkti metre! the Ushnih metre! the Brihatî metre! the Anushtubh metre! the Virâg metre! the Gâyatrî metre! the Trishtubh metre! the Gagatî metre!' these eight defined metres, including the Virâg, he puts down.--, 'The metre Earth! the metre Air! the metre Heaven! the metre Years! the metre Stars! the metre Speech! the metre Mind! the metre Husbandry! the metre Gold! the metre Cow! the metre Goat! the metre Horse!' he thus puts down those metres which are sacred to those particular deities.--, 'The deity Fire! the deity Wind! the deity Sun! the deity Moon! the deity Vasavah! the deity Rudrâh! the deity Âdityâh! the deity Marutah! the deity Visve Devâh! the deity Brihaspati! the deity Indra! the deity Varuna!'--these deities, doubtless, are metres: it is these he thus lays down.
3	3	7	He lays down both defined and undefined (metres). Were he to lay down such as are all defined, then the food would have an end, it would fail; and (were he to lay down) such as are all undefined, then the food would be invisible, and one would not see it at all. He lays down both defined and undefined ones: hence the defined (certain) food which is eaten does not fail.
3	3	8	These then are those (sets of) twelve he lays down,--that makes thirty-six, and the Brihatî consists of thirty-six syllables: this is that same Brihatî, the air, which the gods then saw as a thirdlayer. In that (brihatî set of bricks) the gods come last (or, are highest).
3	3	9	And, again, as to why he lays down these bricks. When Pragâpati became relaxed, all living beings went from him in all directions.
3	3	10	Now that same Pragâpati who became relaxed is this very Agni (fire-altar) that is now being built up; and those living beings which went from him are these bricks: hence when he lays down these (bricks), he thereby puts back into him (Pragâpati-Agni) those same living beings which went from him.
3	3	11	Now when he first lays down ten (Prânabhrits), they are the moon. There are ten of these,--the Virâg; consists of ten syllables, and the Virâg is food, and the moon is food. And when subsequently he lays down thirty-six (Khandasyâs), they are the half-months and months--twenty-four half-months and twelve months: the moon, doubtless, is the year, and all living beings.
3	3	12	And when the gods restored him (Pragâpati-Agni), they put all those living beings inside him, and in like manner does this one now put them therein. He lays them down so as not to be separated from the seasonal (bricks): he thus establishes all living beings in the seasons.
3	4	1	He then lays down the Vâlakhilyâs;--the Vâlakhilyâs, doubtless, are the vital airs: it is the vital airs he thus lays (into Agni). And as to why they are called Vâlakhilyâs,--what (unploughed piece of ground lies) between two cultivated fields is called 'khila;' and these (channels of the) vital airs  are separated from each other by the width of a horsehair (vâla), and because they are separated from each other by the width of a horse-hair, they (the bricks) are called Vâlakhilyâs.
3	4	2	He places seven in front, and seven at the back. When he places seven in front, he thereby restores to him those seven (organs of the) vital airs here in front.
3	4	3	And those seven which (he places) behind he thereby makes the counter-breathings to those (first breathings); and hence by means of (the channels of) these breathings he passes over the food which he eats with those (other) breathings.
3	4	4	And, again, as to why he places seven in front,--there are seven (channels of the) vital airs here in the front part (of the animal) --the four upper and lower parts of the fore-feet, the head, the neck, and what is above the navel that is the sixth, for in each limb there is a vital air: this makes seven vital airs here in front; it is them he thus lays into him (Agni-Pragâpati).
3	4	5	And as to what seven (bricks) he places behind,--there are seven vital airs here in the back part--the four thighs and knee-bones, the two feet, and what is below the navel that is the seventh, for in each limb there is a vital air: this makes seven vital airs here at the back; it is them he thus lays into him.
3	4	6	, 'The head thou art, the ruler! steady thouart, steadfast! a holder thou art, a hold!'--'A guider, a ruler! a guider thou art, a guide! steady thou art, a steadier!' he truly bestows steady vital airs unto him.
3	4	7	And, again, as to why he lays down the Vâlakhilyâs,--it was by means of the Vâlakhilyâs that the gods then ranged over these worlds, both from hence upwards and from yonder downwards; and in like manner does the sacrifice now, by means of the Vâlakhilyâs, range over these worlds, both from hence upwards and from yonder downwards.
3	4	8	By 'The head thou art, the ruler!' they stepped on this (terrestrial) world; by 'Steady thou art, steadfast!' on the air-world; by 'A holder thou art, a hold!' on that (heavenly) world.--'For life-strength (I bestow) thee! for vigour thee! for husbandry thee! for prosperity thee!' There are four (kinds of) four-footed (domestic) animals, and (domestic) animals are food: by means of this food, these four four-footed animals, they (the gods) established themselves in yonder world; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now by means of this food, these four four-footed animals, establish himself in yonder world.
3	4	9	That was, as it were, an ascent away from hence; but this (earth) is a foothold: the gods came back to this foothold; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now come back to this foothold.
3	4	10	By 'A guider, a ruler!' they stepped on that (heavenly) world; by 'A guider thou art, a guide!' on the air-world; by 'Steady thou art, a steadier!' on this () world.--'For sap (I bestow) thee! for strength thee! for wealth thee! for thrift thee!'--There are four four-footed (domestic) animals,and (domestic) animals are food: by means of this food, these four four-footed animals, they (the gods) established themselves in this world; and in like manner does the Sacrificer, by means of this food, these four four-footed animals, establish himself in this world.
3	4	11	Now as to the restoration (of Pragâpati-Agni). Those eleven bricks he lays down , which (constitute) that first anuvâka , are the air and this body (of Agni, the altar). And as to why there are eleven of these, it is because the Trishtubh consists of eleven syllables, and the air is of the trishtubh nature. And the sixty subsequent (bricks) are Vâyu, Pragâpati, Agni, the Sacrificer.
3	4	12	Those which he places in front are his head: there are ten  of them, because there are ten vital airs, and the head is (the focus of) the vital airs. He places them in front, because the head (of an animal) is here in front.
3	4	13	And those which he places on the right (south) side are that (part) of him which is above the waist and below the head. And those at the back are that (part) of him which is above the feet and below the waist. Those on the left (north) side are the feet themselves.
3	4	14	And the seven (Vâlakhilyâs) which he places in front are these seven vital airs here in the forepart (of an animal): it is these he thus puts intohim (Agni). He places them so as not to he separated from those ten (Prânabhrits): he thereby puts in vital airs that are not separate from the head.
3	4	15	And the seven he places at the back (of the altar) are those seven vital airs behind: it is these he thereby puts into him. He places them so as not to be separated from those twelve (Khandasyâs): he thereby puts into him vital airs that are not separate from the body. That same Vâyu-Pragâpati is turned round in all directions in this trishtubh-like air; and when he lays down the third layer, having made up both Vâyu (the wind) and the air, he thereby adds them to himself. He then puts down two Lokamprinâ (space-filling bricks) in that corner : the significance of them (will be explained) further on . He throws loose earth (on the layer): the significance of this (will be explained) further on .
4	1	1	He lays down the fourth layer. For the gods having laid down the third layer, now ascended; but, the third layer being the air; it was the air which, having completed it, they ascended.
4	1	2	They spake, 'Meditate ye!' whereby, indeed,they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer! Seek ye (to build) from hence upwards!' Whilst meditating, they saw that fourth layer, (to wit) what is above the air and below the heavens; that world was to their minds, as it were, unstable and unsettled.
4	1	3	They said to the Brahman, 'We will lay thee down (or, set thee up) here!'--'What will therefrom accrue to me?'--'Thou shalt be the highest of us!'--'So be it!' They accordingly laid the Brahman down here, whence people say that the Brahman is the highest of gods. Now, by this fourth layer these two, heaven and earth, are upheld, and the fourth layer is the Brahman, whence people say that heaven and earth are upheld by the Brahman. He lays down the Stomas (hymn-forms) : the stomas being the vital airs, and the Brahman also being the vital airs, it is the Brahman he thereby lays down.
4	1	4	And, again, as to why he lays down the Stomas. The gods, at that time, said to Pragâpati, 'We will lay thee down here! So be it!' He did not say, 'What will therefrom accrue unto me?' but whenever Pragâpati wished to obtain anything from the gods, they said, 'What will therefrom accrue to us?' And hence even now if a father wishes to obtain anything from his sons, they say, 'What will therefromaccrue unto us?' and when the sons (wish to obtain anything) from the father, he says, 'So be it!' for in this way Pragâpati and the gods used of old to converse together. He lays down the Stomas: the stomas being the vital airs, and Pragâpati also being the vital airs, it is Pragâpati he thus lays down.
4	1	5	And, again, as to why he lays down the Stomas. Those vital airs, the Rishis , that saw this fourth layer , and who stepped nigh with that essential element (of the altar), are these (vital airs): it is them he now lays down. He lays down the Stomas:--the stomas being the vital airs, and the Rishis also being the vital airs, it is the Rishis he thus lays down.
4	1	6	And, again, as to why he lays down the Stomas. When Pragâpati had become relaxed (disjointed), the gods took him and went away. Vâyu, taking that (part) of him which was above the waist and below the head, kept going away from him, having become the deities and the forms of the year.
4	1	7	He spake to him, 'Come to me and restore to me that wherewith thou hast gone from me!'--'What will therefrom accrue unto me?'--'That part of my self shall be sacred unto thee!'--'So be it!' thus Vâyu restored that unto him.
4	1	8	Those eighteen (bricks ) which there are atfirst, are that very (part) of his (Pragâpati's) body; and when he places them in this (layer), he thereby restores to him that (part) of his body which these (form): therefore he places them in this (layer). He lays down the Stomas: the stomas being the vital airs, and Vâyu (the wind) also being the vital airs, it is Vâyu he thus lays down.
4	1	9	In front he lays down one, with , 'The swift one, the Trivrit!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is trivrit (threefold, or thrice-three-versed). And as to why he calls it 'the swift one,' it is because this, indeed, is the swiftest of stomas. But the swift threefold one, doubtless, is Vâyu: he exists in these three worlds. And as to why he calls him 'the swift one,' it is because he is the swiftest of all beings: being (or, in the form of) Vâyu it remained in front,--it is that form he now lays down,
4	1	10	, 'The bright one , the Pañkadasa!' he therewith lays down thathymn-form which is fifteenfold (fifteen-versed). And when he calls it 'the bright one,' it is that the bright one is the thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt is fifteenfold. But the bright, fifteenfold one, doubtless, also is the Moon: he waxes during fifteen days, and wanes during fifteen days. And as to his calling him 'the bright one,' the Moon indeed shines: being the Moon it remained on the right side,--it is that form he now lays down.
4	1	11	, 'The (aerial) space, the Saptadasa!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is seventeenfold. And as to his calling it 'the space,'--the (aerial) space is Pragâpati, and the seventeenfold one is Pragâpati. But indeed the seventeenfold space also is the year: in it there are twelve months and five seasons. And as to his calling it space, the year indeed is space: being space, it remained on the left side,--it is that form he now lays down.
4	1	12	, 'The upholder, the Ekavimsa!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is twenty-one-fold. And as to his calling it 'the upholder,'--the upholder means a foothold, and the Ekavimsa is a foothold. But indeed the twenty-one-fold upholder also is yonder sun: to him belong the twelve months, the five seasons, these three worlds, and yonder sun himself is the upholder, the twenty-one-fold. And as to his calling him 'the upholder,'--when he sets everything here holds its peace: being the sun, it remained at the back,--it is that form he now lays down; and the forms of the year he lays down.
4	1	13	'Speed, the Ashtâdasa!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is eighteenfold. Now,speed, the eighteenfold one, doubtless, is the year: in it there are twelve months, five seasons, and the year itself is speed, the eighteenfold. And as to his calling it 'speed,' the year indeed speeds all beings: it is that form he now lays down.
4	1	14	'Heat, the Navadasa!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is nineteenfold. But heat, the nineteenfold one, doubtless, is the year: in it there are twelve months, six seasons, and the year itself is heat, the nineteenfold. And as to his calling it 'heat,' the year indeed burns all beings: it is that form he now lays down.
4	1	15	'Victorious assault, the Savimsa!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is twentyfold. But victorious assault, the twentyfold one, doubtless, is the year: in it there are twelve months, seven seasons, and the year itself is victorious assault, the twentyfold. And as to why he calls it 'victorious assault,' the year indeed assails all beings: it is that form he now lays down.
4	1	16	'Vigour, the Dvâvimsa!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is twenty-two-fold. But vigour, the twenty-two-fold one, doubtless is the year: in it there are twelve months, seven seasons, the two, day and night, and the year itself is vigour, the twenty-two-fold. And as to why he calls it 'vigour,' the year is indeed the most vigorous of all existing things: it is that form he now lays down.
4	1	17	'The array, the Trayovimsa!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is twenty-three-fold. But array, the twenty-three-fold one, doubtless, means the year: in it there are thirteen months, seven seasons, the two, day and night, and the year itself is the array, the twenty-three-fold. And as to his calling it 'array,' the year is indeed arrayed over all beings: it is that form he now lays down.
4	1	18	'The womb, the Katurvimsa!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is twenty-four-fold. But the womb, the twenty-four-fold one, doubtless, is the year: in it there are twenty-four half-months. And as to his calling it 'the womb,' the year is indeed the womb of all beings: it is that form he now lays down.
4	1	19	'The embryos, the Pañkavimsa!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is twenty-five-fold. But the embryos, the twenty-five-fold one, doubtless; is the year: in it there are twenty-four half-months, and the year itself is the embryos, the twenty-five-fold. And as to his calling it 'the embryos,'--the year, as an embryo, in the shape of the thirteenth month, enters the seasons: it is that form he now lays down.
4	1	20	'Strength, the Trinava!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is thrice ninefold. And as to his calling it 'strength,'--strength (ogas) means the thunderbolt (vagra), and the Trinava is a thunderbolt. But strength also means the year: in it there are twenty-four half-months, the two, day and night, and the year itself is strength, the thrice-ninefold. And as to his calling it 'strength,' the year indeed is the strength of all beings: it is that form he now lays down.
4	1	21	'Design, the Ekatrimsa!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is thirty-one-fold. But design, the thirty-one-fold, doubtless, means the year: in it there are twenty-four half-months, six seasons, and the year itself is design, the thirty-one-fold. Andas to his calling it 'design,' the year indeed designs (makes, forms) all beings: it is that form he now lays down.
4	1	22	'The foundation, the Trayastrimsa!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is thirty-three-fold. And as to why he calls it 'the foundation,' the thirty-three-fold is indeed a foundation. But indeed the foundation, the thirty-three-fold, also is the year: in it there are twenty-four half-months, six seasons, the two, day and night, and the year itself is the foundation, the thirty-three-fold. And as to his calling it 'the foundation,' the year is indeed the foundation of all beings: it is that form he now lays down.
4	1	23	'The range of the ruddy one, the Katustrimsa!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is thirty-four-fold. But the range of the ruddy one (the sun), the thirty-four-fold one, doubtless, is the year: in it there are twenty-four half-months, seven seasons, the two, day and night, and the year itself is the range of the ruddy one, the thirty-four-fold. And as to his calling it 'the range of the ruddy one,' the range of the ruddy one, doubtless, means supreme sway, and the thirty-four-fold one means supreme sway: it is that form he now lays down.
4	1	24	'The firmament, the Shattrimsa!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is thirty-six-fold. But the firmament, the thirty-six-fold one, doubtless, is the year: in it there are twenty-four half-moons, and twelve months. And as to why he calls it 'the firmament' (nâkam), it is because there is no pain (na akam) for whosoever goes there. And the firmament indeed is the year, the heavenly world is the year: it is that form he now lays down.
4	1	25	'The revolving sphere, the Ashtâkatvârimsa!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is forty-eight-fold. But the revolving sphere, the forty-eight-fold, doubtless, is the year: in it there are twenty-six half-months, thirteen months, seven seasons, and the two, day and night. And as to his calling it 'the revolving sphere,' from the year all creatures indeed are evolved: it is that form he now lays down.
4	1	26	'The stay, the Katushtoma!' he therewith lays down the chant of praise consisting of four stomas . And as to his calling it 'the stay,'--stay means support, and the Katushtoma is a support. But the stay, the Katushtoma, doubtless, is Vâyu (the wind), for he sings from all those four quarters. And as to his calling him 'the stay,'--stay means support; and the wind indeed is the support of all beings: it is that form he now lays down. The wind he places first and last: by the wind he thus encloses all these beings on both sides.
4	1	27	These, then, are eighteen bricks he lays down; this makes two Trivrits,--the Trivrit being breath, and breath being wind, this layer is Vâyu.
4	1	28	And as to why there are eighteen,--the year is eighteenfold: twelve months and six seasons. And Pragâpati indeed is the year, Pragâpati is eighteenfold: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great he makes it when he lays it down.
4	2	1	He then lays down the Spritah  (freeingbricks). For when that (part) of his body had been restored, Pragâpati became pregnant with all beings: whilst they were in his womb, evil, death, seized them.
4	2	2	He spake to the gods, 'With you I will free all these beings from evil, from death !'--'What will accrue unto us therefrom?'--'Choose ye!' said he.--'Let there be a share for us!' said some to him. 'Let lordship be unto us!' said others. Having bestowed a share on some, and lordship on others, he freed all beings from evil, from death; and inasmuch as he freed (spri) them, therefore (those bricks are called) 'Spritah.' And in like manner does this Sacrificer, by bestowing a share on some, and lordship on others, now free all beings from evil, from death; and hence (the word) 'spritam (freed)' recurs with all of them.
4	2	3	, Agni's share thou art, Dîkshâ's lordship!'--Dîkshâ, doubtless, is Speech: having bestowed a share on Agni, he bestows lordship on Speech;--'the Brahman is freed; the Trivrit-stoma!'--by means of the thrice-threefold hymn-form he freedthe Brahman (priesthood) for living beings from evil, from death.
4	2	4	'Indra's share thou art, Vishnu's lordship!'--Having bestowed a share on Indra, he bestowed lordship on Vishnu;--'the Kshatra is freed; the Pañkadasa-stoma!'--by means of the fifteenfold hymn-form he freed the Kshatra (nobility) for living beings from evil, from death.
4	2	5	'The man-viewers’ share thou art, the creator's lordship!'--the man-viewers, doubtless, are the gods: having bestowed a share on the gods, he bestowed lordship on the creator;--'the birthplace is freed, the Saptadasa-stoma!'--the birthplace, doubtless, is the peasantry: by means of the seventeenfold hymn-form he frees the peasantry for living beings from evil, from death.
4	2	6	'Mitra's share thou art, Varuna s lordship!'--Mitra, doubtless, is the out-breathing, and Varuna the down-breathing: having bestowed a share on the out-breathing, he bestowed lordship on the down-breathing;--'heaven's rain, the wind is freed; the Ekavimsa-stoma!'--by means of the twenty-one-fold hymn-form he frees both rain and wind for living beings from evil, from death.
4	2	7	'The Vasus’ share thou art, the Rudras' lordship!'--having bestowed a share on the Vasus, he bestowed lordship on the Rudras;--'the four-footed is freed, the Katurvimsa-stoma!'--by means of the twenty-five-fold hymn-form he freed the four-footed for living beings from evil, from death.
4	2	8	'The Âdityas’ share thou art, the Maruts’ lordship!'--having bestowed a share on the Âdityas, he bestowed lordship on the Maruts;--'theembryos are freed, the Pañkavimsa-stoma!'--by means of the twenty-five-fold hymn-form he freed the embryos for living beings from evil, from death.
4	2	9	'Aditi's share thou art, Pûshan's lordship!'--Aditi, doubtless, is this (earth): having bestowed a share on her, he bestowed lordship on Pûshan,--'vigour is freed; the Trinava-stoma!' by means of the thrice-ninefold hymn-form he freed vigour for living beings from evil, from death.
4	2	10	'God Savitri's share thou art, Brihaspati's lordship!'--having bestowed a share on the god Savitri, he bestows lordship on Brihaspati;--'the facing quarters are freed, the Katushtoma!'--by means of the chant of praise consisting of four stomas he freed all the (four) quarters for living beings from evil, from death.
4	2	11	'The Yavas’ share thou art, the Ayavas’ lordship!'--the Yavas, doubtless, are the first (light) fortnights, and the Ayavas the latter (dark) fortnights, for these gain (yu) and obtain (â-yu) everything here : having bestowed a share on the first fortnights, he bestowed lordship on the latter fortnights;--'the creatures are freed, the Katuskatvârimsa-stoma!'--by means of the forty-four-fold hymn-form he freed all creatures from evil, from death.
4	2	12	'The Ribhus’ share thou art, the All-gods’ lordship!'--having bestowed a share on the Ribhus, he bestowed lordship on the Visve-Devâh;-- 'the living being is freed, the Trayastrimsa-stoma!'--by means of the thirty-three-fold hymn-form he freed all living beings from evil, from death; and in like manner does the Sacrificer, by means of the thirty-three-fold hymn-form, now free all living beings from evil, from death.
4	2	13	These, then, are ten bricks he lays down,--the Virâg consists of ten syllables, and Agni is Virâg (wide-shining); there are ten regions, and Agni is the regions; there are ten vital airs, and Agni is the vital airs: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus frees all these creatures from evil, from death.
4	2	14	He then lays down two Ritavyâs  (seasonal bricks);--the seasonal ones being the same as the seasons, it is the seasons he thus lays down;--with , 'Saha and Sahasya, the two winter-seasons!' These are the names of those two, it is with their names he thus lays them down. There are two such bricks, for a season consists of two months. Only once he settles them: he thus makes (the two months) one season.
4	2	15	And as to why he places these two (bricks) in this (layer),--this Agni (fire-altar) is the year, and the year is these worlds: what part thereof is above the air, and below the sky, that is this fourth layer, and that is the winter-season thereof; and when he places these two in this (layer), he thereby restores to him (Pragâpati-Agni, the year and fire-altar) what part of his body these two (constitute). This is why he places these two in this (layer).
4	2	16	And, again, as to why he places these two in this (layer),--this Agni is Pragâpati, and Pragâpati is the year: what (part) of him there is above the waist, and below the head, that is this fourth layer, and that is the winter-season of him (or, of it, the year). And when he places these two in this (layer), he thereby restores to him what part of his body these two (constitute). This is why he places these two in this (layer).
4	3	1	He then lays down the Srishtis  (creations). For Pragâpati, having freed all beings from evil,from death, he now desired, 'May I produce creatures, may I procreate!'
4	3	2	He spake unto the vital airs , 'Together with you, I will here bring forth creatures!'--'Wherewith shall we sing praises ?'--'With me and withyourselves!'--'So be it!' So they sang praises both with the vital airs and with Pragâpati; and whatsoever the gods do, that they do with praise, that--praise being sacrifice--they do with sacrifice. Hence (the words) 'they sang praises' recur with all (these bricks).
4	3	3	, 'With one they sang praises,'--the one, doubtless, is speech: it is with speech they then sang praises;--'creatures were conceived,'--creatures indeed were now conceived;--'Pragâpati was the lord!'--Pragâpati indeed was now the lord.
4	3	4	'With three they sang praises,'--there are three vital airs: the out-breathing, the up-breathing, and the through-breathing: it is with them they then sang praises;--'the Brahman was created,'--the priesthood indeed was now created;--'Brahmanaspati was the lord!' Brahmanaspati indeed was now the lord.
4	3	5	'With five they sang praises,'--what (four) vital airs there are here, with mind as a fifth: it is with them they then sang praises;--'the living beings were created,'--the living beings indeed were now created;--'the lord of beings was the lord!'--the lord of beings indeed was now the lord.
4	3	6	'With seven they sang praises,'--what seven vital airs there are here in the head: it is with them they then sang praises;--'the seven Rishis were created,'--the seven Rishis indeed were now created;--'the creator was the lord!'--the creator indeed was now the lord.
4	3	7	'With nine they sang praises,'--there are nine vital airs, seven in the head, and two downwardones: it is with them they then sang praises;--'the Fathers were created,'--the Fathers indeed were now created;--'Aditi was the ruler!'--Aditi indeed was now the ruler.
4	3	8	'With eleven they sang praises,'--there are ten vital airs, and the trunk is the eleventh: it is therewith they then sang praises;--'the seasons were created,'--the seasons indeed were now created;--'the seasonal periods were the lords!'--the seasonal periods indeed were now the lords.
4	3	9	'With thirteen they sang praises,'--there are ten vital airs, and two feet, and the trunk is the thirteenth: it is therewith they then sang praises;--'the months were created,'--the months indeed were now created;--'the year was the lord!' the year indeed was now the lord.
4	3	10	'With fifteen they sang praises,'--there are ten fingers, four fore-arms and upper arms, and what is above the navel is the fifteenth: it is therewith they then sang praises the Kshatra was created,'--the nobility indeed was now created;--'Indra was the lord!'--Indra indeed was now the lord.
4	3	11	'With seventeen they sang praises,'--there are ten toes, four thighs and shanks, two feet, and what is below the navel is the seventeenth: it is therewith they then sang praises the tame animals were created,'--the tame animals indeed were now created;--'Brihaspati was the lord!'--Brihaspati indeed was now the lord.
4	3	12	'With nineteen they sang praises,'--there are ten fingers, and nine vital airs: it is with these they then sang praises;--'the Sûdra and Ârya were created,'--the Sûdra and Ârya indeedwere now created;--'the day and night were the rulers!'--the day and night indeed were now the rulers.
4	3	13	'With twenty-one they sang praises,'--there are ten fingers, ten toes, and the trunk is the twenty-first: it is therewith that they then sang praises;--'the one-hoofed animals were created,'--the one-hoofed animals indeed were now created;--'Varuna was the lord!'--Varuna indeed was now the lord.
4	3	14	'With twenty-three they sang praises,'--there are ten fingers, ten toes, two feet, and the trunk is the twenty-third: it is therewith they then sang praises;--'the small animals were created,'--the small animals indeed were now created;--'Pûshan was the lord!'--Pûshan indeed was now the lord.
4	3	15	'With twenty-five they sang praises,'--there are ten fingers, ten toes, four limbs, and the trunk is the twenty-fifth: it is therewith they then sang praises;--'the wild animals were created,'--the wild animals indeed were now created;--'Vâyu was the lord!'--Vâyu indeed was now the lord.
4	3	16	'With twenty-seven they sang praises,'--there are ten fingers, ten toes, four limbs, two feet, and the trunk is the twenty-seventh: it is therewith they then sang praises;--'Heaven and Earth went asunder,'--heaven and earth indeed now went asunder;--'the Vasus, Rudras and Âdityas separated along with them: they indeed were the lords!' and they indeed were now the lords.
4	3	17	'With twenty-nine they sang praises;'--there are ten fingers, ten toes, and nine vital airs: it is with these they then sang praises;--'the trees were created,'--the trees indeed were now created;--'Soma was the lord,'--Soma indeed was now the lord.
4	3	18	'With thirty-one they sang praises,'--there are ten fingers, ten toes, ten vital airs, and the trunk is the thirty-first: it is therewith they then sang praises;--'the creatures were created,'--the creatures indeed were now created;--' the Yavas and Ayavas were the lords,'--the bright and dark fortnights indeed were now the lords.
4	3	19	'With thirty-three they sang praises,'--there are ten fingers, ten toes, ten vital airs, two feet, and the trunk is the thirty-third: it is therewith they then sang praises;--'the living beings lay quiet,'--all living beings now indeed lay quiet;--'Pragâpati, the supreme, was the lord!'--Pragâpati, the supreme, indeed was now the lord.
4	3	20	These, then, are seventeen bricks he lays down,--the year, Pragâpati, is seventeenfold, he is the progenitor: it is thus by this seventeenfold year, by Pragâpati, the progenitor, that he caused these creatures to be generated. And what he generated, he created; and inasmuch as he created (srig), therefore they are called creations (srishti). Having created them, he made them enter his own self: and in like manner does the Sacrificer now cause these creatures to be generated by that seventeenfold year, by Pragâpati, the progenitor; and having created them, he makes them enter his own self . On therange of the Retahsik (he lays down these bricks): the Retahsik being the ribs, and the ribs the middle (of the body), it is in the very middle that he causes these creatures to enter him. He lays them on all sides: from all sides he thus makes these creatures to enter him.
4	4	1	Now, then, as to the order of proceeding. That (brick) which contains the Trivrit (thrice-threefold stoma) he places in front, that containing the twenty-one-fold (stoma) at the back, that containing the fifteenfold (stoma) on the right (south) side, that containing the seventeenfold (stoma) on the left (north) side.
4	4	2	Now when the one containing the Trivrit had been laid down, Death lay in wait for Pragâpati in the one (on the south side) containing the fifteenfold (stoma), thinking, 'After that he will lay down this one: I will here seize upon him!' He (Pragâpati) was aware of him, and having seen him, he walked round and laid down (at the back) the (brick) containing the twenty-one-fold (stoma). Death came thither, and he (Pragâpati) laid down the one (on the south side) containing the fifteenfold (stoma). Death came to the fifteenfold one, and he (Pragâpati) laid down the one (on the north side) containing the seventeenfold (stoma). It was here  that he put down and confounded Death; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now put down and confound all evils
4	4	3	Then as to the subsequent (bricks). Alongside of the one (in front) containing the Trivrit he lays down one containing the Trivrit; alongside of that (at the back) containing the Ekavimsa (he lays down) one containing the Ekavimsa; alongside of that (on the south, or right, side) containing the Pañkadasa (he lays down) one containing the Saptadasa; alongside of that (on the north, or left, side) containing the Saptadasa (he lays down) one containing the Pañkadasa. And because he thus changes in laying them down , therefore they (the bricks) are of diverse stomas; and because these stomas are then otherwise with regard to the former ones , therefore also they (the bricks) are of diverse stomas. And in this way the gods laid them down, and otherwise the Asuras; whereupon the gods succeeded, and the Asuras came to naught: he who knows this, succeeds of himself, and his hateful enemy comes to naught.
4	4	4	Now, this Agni (fire-altar) is an animal, and he is made up (restored) here whole and entire. His head is the two (bricks) containing the Trivrit; and as to why these two are such as contain the Trivrit,--the head is threefold (trivrit). There are two of them, because the head consists of two bones (kapâla). He lays them down in front, for this head is in the front (of the animal).
4	4	5	The two (behind) containing the Ekavimsa are the foundation (the feet). And as to why these are such as contain the Ekavimsa,--the Ekavimsa isa foundation. There are two of them,--because the foundation is a pair (of feet). He places them behind, because this foundation (the hind-feet) is behind.
4	4	6	The two containing the Pañkadasa  are the arms (or fore-feet). And as to why these are such as contain the Pañkadasa,--the arms are fifteenfold. There are two of them, because these arms are two. He places them on the sides, because these two arms are at the sides.
4	4	7	The two containing the Saptadasa are food. And as to why they are such as contain the Saptadasa,--food is seventeenfold. There are two of them, because 'anna' (food) has two syllables. He lays them down close to those containing the Pañkadasa he thus puts the food close to the arms. Those containing the Pañkadasa are on the outside, and those containing the Saptadasa on the inside: he thus encloses the food on both sides by the arms.
4	4	8	And those he places in the middle are the body (trunk). He places them on the range of the Retahsik (bricks), for--the Retahsik being the ribs, and the ribs being the middle (of the body)--this body is in the middle (of the limbs) . He places them in every direction, for this body (extends) in every direction. And as to what other (space) there is besides this, that is left over;--and what is left over for the gods, that is these metres;--and as to thesemetres, they are cattle;--and as to cattle, they are (objects of) good fortune;--and as to these (objects of) good fortune, they are yonder sun: he is that one to the south of them.
4	4	9	Now some lay down these (rows of bricks ) immediately after the two containing the Trivrit, saying, 'They are the tongue and the jaws: those fourteen are the jaws, and those six are the tongue.' Let him not do so: they cause a redundancy,--it would be just as if one were to put two other jaws to the already existing jaws, as if one were to put another tongue to the already existing tongue. That (brick) wherein the head is indeed (includes) the jaws and the tongue.
4	4	10	Now some lay down (these bricks) in the intermediate (south-eastern) space of it (the altar) , saying, 'This is the sun: we thus place yonder sun in that direction.' Let him not do so: surely there are those other rites  by which he places him in that (direction).
4	4	11	Some, again, lay them down on the right (south ) side, saying, 'We thus place these signs of good fortune (punyâ lakshmî) on the right side:' whence he who has a mark  (lakshman) on his right side is said to have good luck (punya-lakshmîka), and on the left side in the case of a woman ; for the woman has her position on the left side (of the man): therefore it is done thus. But let him place them in front; for where the head is there are also the jaws and the tongue: and thus he places the signs of good fortune at the head (or, in the mouth, mukhatah), whence they say that he who has a (peculiar) mark in his mouth  has good luck.
4	4	12	This, indeed, is Brahman's layer: inasmuch as they (the gods) laid down the Brahman , therefore it is Brahman's layer. It is Pragâpati's layer: inasmuch as they laid down Pragâpati , it is Pragâpati's layer. It is the Rishis’ layer: inasmuch as they laid down the Rishis , it is the Rishis’ layer. It is Vâyu's layer: inasmuch as they laid down Vâyu , it is Vâyu's layer. It is the Stomas’ layer: inasmuch as they laid down the hymn-forms , it is the Stomas’layer. It is the layer of the vital airs: inasmuch as they laid down the vital airs , it is the layer of the vital airs. Hence, whatsoever one may know, that comes to be included in the ancestry, in the kinship  of this layer.--He then lays down two Lokamprinâs (space-filling bricks) in that corner : the significance of these (will be explained) farther on . He throws loose soil thereon: the significance of this (will be explained) farther on .
5	1	1	He lays down the fifth layer. For now, having laid down the fourth layer, the gods mounted it,--having completed what is above the air, and below the sky, they mounted it.
5	1	2	They spake, 'Meditate ye (ketay)!' whereby, doubtless, they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer (kiti)! Seek ye from hence upwards!' Whilst meditating, they saw that fifth layer, the far-shining heaven: that world pleased them.
5	1	3	They desired, 'Would that we could make that world foeless, undisturbed!' They spake, 'Think ye upon this, how we shall make this worldfoeless, undisturbed!' They spake, 'Meditate ye!' whereby, indeed, they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer! Seek ye how we shall make this world foeless, undisturbed!'
5	1	4	Whilst meditating, they saw these Asapatnâ ('foeless') bricks; they laid them down, and by means of them they made that world foeless, undisturbed; and because by means of them they made that world foeless, undisturbed, these (are called) Asapatnâs. And in like manner does the Sacrificer, by laying them down, now make that world foeless, undisturbed. On all (four) sides he lays them down: on all sides he thus makes that world foeless, undisturbed. He places them on the other side: he thereby makes that whole world foe-less, undisturbed.
5	1	5	He then lays down the Virâgs  (far-shining bricks): this Virâg, indeed, is that far-shining (virâg) fifth layer which the gods saw. He lays them down by tens: the Virâg (metre) consists of ten syllables, and this layer is 'virâg.' He places them on every side; for he who shines (rules) in one direction only, does not shine far and wide, but whosoever shines in all directions, he alone shines far and wide.
5	1	6	And as to why he lays down those Asapatnâs. Now at that time, when that (part) of his body had been restored, evil beset Pragâpati on every side. He saw those foeless bricks, and laid them down, and by means of them he drove off evil, for foe means evil; and because, by means of them he drove off the foe, evil, therefore they are (called) 'foeless' (bricks).
5	1	7	And what the gods did, the same is done now. Evil, indeed, does not now beset this (Sacrificer), but when he now does this, it is that he wants to do what the gods did; and he thereby drives off whatever evil, whatever foe besets him; and because, by means of them, he drives off the foe, evil, therefore they are (called) the 'foeless' (bricks). He places them on every side: he thereby drives off the foe, evil, on every side. He places them on the other side: from his whole self he thereby drives off the foe, evil.
5	1	8	He lays down (one) in front , with , 'O Agni, drive away the foes of ours that are born, drive back those unborn, O knower of beings! cheer us, kindly and un-frowning! may we be in thy threefold-sheltering, steadfast protection!' as the text so the sense. Then behind, with , 'With might drive away the foes of ours that are born,drive back, O knower of beings, those unborn! cheer us with kindly feeling! may we prevail! drive off our foes!' as the text so the sense.
5	1	9	That which is (placed) in front is Agni, and that behind is Agni: with Agni he (Pragâpati) then drove away evil both in front and in the rear; and in like manner now does the Sacrificer with Agni drive away evil both in front and in the rear.
5	1	10	Then on the right (south) side, with , 'The sixteenfold Stoma, vigour, wealth!' The Trishtubh consists of eleven syllables, and--the air being of Trishtubh nature--there are (in the air) four quarters. The thunderbolt is fifteenfold, and yonder sun is the sixteenfold wielder of that thunderbolt: with that thunderbolt, with that Trishtubh, he (Pragâpati) drove away evil in the south; and in like manner does the Sacrificer, with that thunderbolt, with that Trishtubh, now drive away evil in the south.
5	1	11	Then on the left (north) side, with, 'The forty-four-fold Stoma, lustre, wealth!' The Trishtubh consists of forty-four syllables, and the thunderbolt is of Trishtubh nature: with that forty-four-fold thunderbolt, with that Trishtubh, he (Pragâpati) drove away evil in the north; and in like manner does the Sacrificer, with that thunderbolt, with that Trishtubh, now drive away evil in the north.
5	1	12	Then in the middle (the fifth), with, 'Agni's soil-cover thou art!'--the fourth layer indeed is the Brahman, and the Brahman is Agni, and this, the fifth layer is, as it were, the (soil-)cover of that (fourth layer);--'his sap, in truth: may the All-gods sing thy praises! Seat thee here, laden with Stomas, and rich in fat! Gain for us, bysacrifice, wealth with offspring!' as the text so the sense.
5	1	13	This one he lays down with its line-marks running eastward and crosswise ; for by that one Pragâpati then cut out the root of evil, and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now thereby cut out the root of evil. On the right (south) side (from the centre he places it), for the thunderbolt has a string  on the right side;--inside the one in the southern quarter, for it is for the sake of extension that he leaves that space.
5	1	14	The one which (lies) in front is the out-breathing, the one at the back the off-breathing: by the out-breathing he (Pragâpati) then drove away evil in front, and by the off-breathing in the rear; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now by the out-breathing drive away evil in front, and by the off-breathing in the rear.
5	1	15	And the two on both sides (of the spine) are the two arms: whatever evil there was sideways of him, that he drove away with his arms; and in like manner does this Sacrificer now drive away with his arms whatever evil there is sideways of him.
5	1	16	The soil-bedded one  means food: whatever evil there was above him, that he (Pragâpati) drove away by means of food; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now, by means of food, drive away whatever evil there is above him.
5	1	17	And, verily, whenever he, knowing this, breathes out, he thereby drives away the evil which is in front of him; and when he breathes backward, he thereby (drives away) that which is in the rear; and when he does work with his arms, he thereby (drives away) that which is sideways of him; and when he eats food, he thereby (drives away) that (evil) which is above him: at all times, indeed, even while sleeping, does he who knows this drive away evil. Hence, one must not speak ill of him who knows this, lest one should be his evil (enemy).
5	2	1	He then lays down those Khandasyâs  (relating to the metres). For Pragâpati, having freed himself from evil, death, asked for food; hence, to this day, a sick man, when he gets better, asks for food; and people have hope for him, thinking, 'He asks for food, he will live.' The gods gave him that food, these (bricks) relating to the metres; for the metres are cattle, and cattle are food. They (the metres) pleased him, and inasmuch as they pleased (khand) him they are (called) metres (khandas).
5	2	2	He lays them down by tens,--the Virâg consists of ten syllables, and all food is 'virâg' (shining, or ruling): he thus bestows all food on him. On all (four) sides he places them: from all sides he thus bestows food on him.
5	2	3	, 'The Course metre,'--the 'course' metre, doubtless, is this (terrestrial) world;--'the Expanse metre,'--the 'expanse' metre, doubtless, is the air; 'the Blissful metre,'--the 'blissful' metre, doubtless, is the sky;--'the Encircler metre,'--the 'encircler' metre, doubtless, is the regions;--'the Vestment metre,'--the 'vestment' metre, doubtless, is food;--'the Mind metre,'--the 'mind' metre, doubtless, is Pragâpati; 'the Extent metre,'--the 'extent' metre, doubtless, is yonder sun.
5	2	4	'The Stream metre,'--the 'stream' metre, doubtless, is the breath;--'the Sea metre,'--the 'sea' metre, doubtless, is the mind;--'the Flood metre,'--the 'flood' metre, doubtless, is speech;--'the Kakubh (peak) metre,'--the 'Kakubh' metre, doubtless, is the out (and in)-breathing;--'the Three-peaked metre,'--the 'three-peaked' metre, doubtless, is the up-breathing;--'the Wisdom metre,'--the wisdom' metre, doubtless, is the threefold science;--'the Arikupa metre,'--the 'Arikupa ' metre, doubtless, is the water;--'the Aksharapaṅkti metre,'--the Aksharapaṅkti (row of syllables) metre, doubtless, is yonder (heavenly) world;--'the Padapaṅkti metre,'--the Padapaṅkti (row of words or steps) metre, doubtless, is this (terrestrial) world;--'the Vishtârapaṅkti metre,'--the Vishtârapaṅkti (row of expansion) metre, doubtless, is the regions;--'the Bright Razor metre,'--the 'brightrazor' metre, doubtless, is yonder sun;--'the Vestment metre, the Investment metre,'--the 'vestment' metre, doubtless, is food, and the 'investment' metre is food.
5	2	5	'The Uniting metre,'--the 'uniting' metre, doubtless, is the night;--'the Separating metre,'--the 'separating' metre, doubtless, is the day;--'the Brihat metre,'--the 'brihat' (great) metre, doubtless, is yonder world;--'the Rathantara metre,'--the 'rathantara' metre, doubtless, is this world;--'the Troop metre,'--the 'troop' metre, doubtless, is the wind;--'the Yoke metre,'--the 'yoke' metre, doubtless, is the air;--'the Devourer metre,'--the 'devourer' metre, doubtless, is food;--'the Bright metre,'--the 'bright' metre, doubtless, is the fire;--'the Samstubh metre, the Anushtubh metre,'--the 'samstubh' metre, doubtless, is speech, and the 'anushtubh' metre is speech;--'the Course metre, the Expanse metre,'--the meaning of this has been explained.
5	2	6	'The Strength metre,'--the 'strength' metre, doubtless, is food;--'the Strength-maker metre,' the 'strength-maker' metre, doubtless, is Agni (the fire);--'the Striver metre,'--the 'striver' metre, doubtless, is yonder world;--'the Ample metre,'--the 'ample' metre, doubtless, is this world;--'the Cover metre,'--the 'cover' metre, doubtless, is the air;--'the Unclimbable metre,'--the 'unclimbable' metre, doubtless, is yonder sun;--'the Slow metre,'--the 'slow' metre, doubtless, is the Paṅkti;--'the Aṅkâṅka metre,'--the 'aṅkâṅka ' metre, doubtless, is water.
5	2	7	Now of those which he lays down in front, the first is the out (and in)-breathing, the second the through-breathing, the third the up-breathing, the fourth the up-breathing, the fifth the through-breathing, the sixth the out-breathing, the seventh the out-breathing, the eighth the through-breathing, the ninth the up-breathing, and the tenth, in this case, is the Sacrificer himself: this same Sacrificer, being raised and firmly established on this Virâg (brick), made up of breath, lays down (bricks) extending both backward and forward, for the breathings move both backward and forward.
5	2	8	And of those on the right (south) side, the first is Agni (fire), the second Vâyu (the wind), the third Âditya (the sun), the fourth Âditya, the fifth Vâyu, the sixth Agni, the seventh Agni, the eighth Vâyu, the ninth Âditya, and the tenth, in this case, is the Sacrificer himself: this same Sacrificer, being raised and firmly established on this Virâg, made up of deities, puts on (bricks) extending both hitherwards and thitherwards, for those gods move both hitherwards and thitherwards.
5	2	9	And of those behind, the first is this (terrestrial) world, the second the air, the third the sky, the fourth the sky, the fifth the air, the sixth this world, the seventh this world, the eighth the air, the ninth the sky, and the tenth, in this case, is the Sacrificer himself: this same Sacrificer, being raised and firmly established on that Virâg made up of the worlds, lays down (bricks) extending both hitherwards and thitherwards;--whence these worlds extend both hitherwards and thitherwards.
5	2	10	And of those on the left (north) side, the first is the summer, the second the rainy season, thethird the winter, the fourth the winter, the fifth the rainy season, the sixth the summer, the seventh the summer, the eighth the rainy season, the ninth the winter, and the tenth, in this case, is the Sacrificer himself: this same Sacrificer, being raised and firmly established on that Virâg, made up of the seasons, lays down (bricks) extending both hitherwards and thitherwards;--whence those seasons move both hitherwards and thitherwards .
5	2	11	And, again, those which he lays down in front are the vital airs. There are ten of them, for there are ten vital airs. He places them in the front part, for these vital airs are in the front part.
5	2	12	And those on the right (south) side are the deities,--Agni, the Earth, Vâyu, the Air, Âditya, the Sky, Kandra (the moon), the Stars, Food, and Water.
5	2	13	And those behind are the regions (quarters),--four regions, four intermediate regions, the upper region, and this (earth).
5	2	14	And those on the left (north) side are the months,--two spring-months, two summer-months, two months of the rainy season, two autumn-months, and two winter-months.
5	2	15	And, again, the first ten are this (terrestrial) world, the second the air, the third the sky. By the first set of ten they (the gods) ascended this (earth), by the second the air, by the third the sky; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now, by the first set of ten, ascend this (earth), by the second the air, and by the third the sky.
5	2	16	This, then, is, as it were, an ascent away fromhere; but this (earth) is the foundation: the gods came back to this (earth), the foundation; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now come back to this (earth), the foundation. And that last set of ten is this world: hence, even as (takes place) that start from the first set of ten, so from the last; for this is the same,--those two sets of ten (the first and last) are this (terrestrial) world.
5	2	17	Now these are forty bricks and forty formulas,--that makes eighty, and eighty (asîti) means food : thus whatever he now says that he makes to be food, asîti, and gives it him, and thereby gratifies him (Agni).
5	3	1	He then lays down the Stomabhâgâ (praise-sharing bricks). For at that time Indra set his mind upon that food of Pragâpati, and tried to go from him. He spake, 'Why dost thou go from me? why dost thou leave me?'--'Give me the essence of that food: enter me therewith!'--'So be it!' so he gave him the essence of that food, and entered him therewith.
5	3	2	Now he who was that Pragâpati is this very Agni (the fire-altar) that is now being built up; and that food is these Khandasyâ (bricks); and that essence of food is these Stomabhâgâs; and he who was Indra is yonder Âditya (the sun): he indeed is the Stoma (hymn of praise), for whatsoever praises they sing, it is him they praise thereby,--it is to that same Stoma he gave a share; and inasmuch ashe gave a share (bhâga) to that Stoma, these are (called) Stomabhâgâs.
5	3	3	, 'By the ray quicken thou the truth for truth!'--the ray, doubtless, is that (sun), and ray is food; having put together that (sun) and the essence thereof, he makes it enter his own self;--'by the starting, by the law, quicken the law!'--the starting, doubtless, is that (sun), and the starting also means food: having put together that (sun) and the essence thereof, he makes it enter his own self;--'by the going after, by the sky, quicken the sky!'--the going after, doubtless, is that (sun), and the going after also means food; having put together that (sun) and the essence thereof, he makes it enter his own self. Thus whatever he mentions here, that and the essence thereof he puts together and makes it enter his own self: 'By such and such quicken thou such and such!'--'Such and such thou art: for such and such (I deposit) thee!'--'By the lord, by strength, quicken strength!' thus they (the bricks) are divided into three kinds, for food is of three kinds.
5	3	4	And as to why he lays down the Stomabhâgâs. Now the gods, having laid down the far-shining layer, mounted it. They spake, 'Meditate ye!' whereby, doubtless, they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer!' Whilst meditating, they saw even the firmament, the heavenly world, and laid it down. Now that same firmament, the heavenly world, indeed is the same as these Stomabhâgâs, and thus in laying down these, he lays down the firmament, the heavenly world.
5	3	5	The first three (bricks) are this (terrestrial)world, the second (three) the air, and the third (three) the sky, the fourth the eastern, the fifth the southern, the sixth the western, and the seventh the northern regions.
5	3	6	These twenty-one bricks, then, are these worlds and the regions, and these worlds and the regions are a foundation, and these worlds and the regions are twenty-one: whence they say, 'the Ekavimsa (twenty-one-fold) is a foundation.'
5	3	7	And the eight bricks which remain over are the Gâyatrî consisting of eight syllables; but the Gâyatrî is the Brahman, and as to that Brahman, it is yonder burning disk: it burns, while firmly-established on that twenty-one-fold one, as on a foundation, whence it does not fall down.
5	3	8	Now some lay down a thirtieth (Stomabhâgâ), with, 'Beautifully arrayed, quicken thou the kshatra for the kshatra!' saying, 'Of thirty syllables is the Virâg (metre) and this layer is virâg (far-shining).' But let him not do so: they (who do so) exceed (this layer so as not to be) amounting to the twenty-one-fold, and to the Gâyatrî; and that undiminished Virâg, doubtless, is the world of Indra: in the world of Indra they raise a spiteful enemy of equal power (to Indra), and thrust Indra out of the world of Indra. And at his own sacrifice the Sacrificer assuredly is Indra: in the Sacrificer's realm they raise for the Sacrificer a spiteful enemy of equal power, and thrust the Sacrificer out of the Sacrificer's own realm. But, surely, that fire which they bring hither is no other than this Sacrificer: by means of his foundation it is he who is the thirtieth (brick) in this (layer).
5	4	1	He lays them down on the range of the Ashâdhâ; for the Ashâdhâ is speech, and this (set of bricks ) is the essence (of food): he thus lays into speech the essence of food; whence it is through (the channel of) speech that one distinguishes the essence of food for all the limbs.
5	4	2	And, again, as to why (on the range) of the Ashâdhâ;--the Ashâdhâ, doubtless, is this (earth), and the Stomabhâgâs are yonder sun: he thus establishes yonder sun upon this earth as a firm foundation.
5	4	3	And, again, why (on that) of the Ashâdhâ;--the Ashâdhâ, doubtless, is this (earth), and the Stomabhâgâs are the heart: he thus lays into this (earth) the heart, the mind: whence on this (earth) one thinks with the heart, with the mind. He lays them down on every side: he thus places the heart, the mind everywhere; whence everywhere on this (earth) one thinks with the heart, with the mind. And, moreover, these (bricks) are lucky signs: he places them on all sides; whence they say of him who has a (lucky) sign (lakshman) on every (or any) side that he has good luck (punyalakshmîka).
5	4	4	He then covers them with loose soil; for loose soil (purîsha) means food, and this (set of bricks) is the essence (of food): he thus makes it invisible, for invisible, as it were, is the essence of food.
5	4	5	And, again, as to why (he covers it) with loosesoil;--loose soil, doubtless, means food, and this (set of bricks) is the essence: he thus joins and unites the food and its essence.
5	4	6	And, again, as to why with loose soil;--the Stomabhâgâs are the heart, and the loose soil is the pericardium: he thus encloses the heart in the pericardium.
5	4	7	And, again, as to why with loose soil;--this fire-altar is the year, and by means of the soil-coverings of the layers he divides it: those first four layers are four seasons. And having laid down the Stomabhâgâs, he throws loose soil thereon: that is the fifth layer, that is the fifth season.
5	4	8	Here now they say, 'Since the other layers conclude with Lokamprinâs (space-filling bricks), and no space-filler is laid down in this (layer): what, then, is the space-filler therein?' The space-filler, surely, is yonder sun, and this layer is he; and this is of itself  a space-filling layer. And what there is above this (layer) up to the covering of soil that is the sixth layer, that is the sixth season.
5	4	9	He then throws down the loose soil. Thereon he lays down the Vikarnî and the naturally-perforated (brick); he bestrews them with chips of gold, and places the fire thereon: that is the seventh layer, that is the seventh season.
5	4	10	But, indeed, there are only six of them; for as to the Vikarnî and the Svayam-âtrinnâ, they belong to the sixth layer.
5	4	11	And, indeed, there are only five of them,--on the other (layers) he throws down the loose soil with a prayer, and here (he does so) silently: in thatrespect this is not a layer. And the other layers end with space-fillers, but here he lays down no space-filler: in that respect also this is not a layer.
5	4	12	And, indeed, there are only three of them,--the first layer is this very (terrestrial) world; and the uppermost (layer) is the sky; and those three (intermediate layers) are the air, for there is, as it were, only one air here: thus (there are) three, or five, or six, or seven of them.
6	1	1	He lays down the Nâkasads (firmament-seated bricks): the firmament-seated ones, assuredly, are the gods. In this (layer) that whole fire-altar becomes completed, and therein these (bricks are) the firmament (nâka), the world of heaven: it is therein that the gods seated themselves; and inasmuch as the gods seated themselves on that firmament, in the world of heaven, the gods are the firmament-seated. And in like manner does the Sacrificer, when he lays down these (bricks), now seat himself on that firmament, in the world of heaven.
6	1	2	And, again, why he lays down the Nâkasads. Now at that time the gods saw that firmament, the world of heaven, these Stomabhâgâs . They spake, 'Think ye upon this, how we may seat ourselves on that firmament, in the world of heaven!' They spake, 'Meditate ye! seek ye a layer!' whereby, indeed, they said, 'Seek ye this, how we may seat ourselves on this firmament, in the world of heaven!'
6	1	3	Whilst meditating, they saw these bricks, the Nâkasads, and placed them on (the altar): by means of them they seated themselves on that firmament, in the world of heaven; and inasmuch as through them they seated themselves (sad) on that firmament (nâka), in the world of heaven, these are the Nâka-sad (bricks); and in like manner does the Sacrificer, when he lays down these (bricks), now seat himself on that firmament, in the world of heaven.
6	1	4	He places them in the (four) quarters; for that firmament, the world of heaven, is the quarters: he thus establishes them in the world of heaven. On the range of the Ritavyâs (he places them); for the Ritavyâs (seasonal bricks) are the year, and the world of heaven is the year: it is in the world of heaven he thus establishes them. Within the Stomabhâgâs (he places them); for this is the firmament, the world of heaven: it is therein he thus establishes them.
6	1	5	In front he lays down one, with , 'Queen thou art, the Eastern region,' for a queen indeed the eastern region is;--'The divine Vasus are thine overlords ,' for the divine Vasus are indeed the overlords of that region;--'Agni is the repeller of shafts,' for Agni, indeed, is here the repeller of shafts;--'The Trivrit-Stoma may uphold thee on earth!' for by the threefold hymn(-form) this one is indeed upheld on earth;--'The Âgya-sastra may support thee for steadiness’ sake !' for by the Âgya-sastra it is indeed supported on earth for steadiness’ sake;--'the Rathantara-sâman for stability in the air!' for by the Rathantara-sâman it is indeed established in the air;--'May the Rishis, the first-born, magnify  thee among the gods!'--the Rishis, the first-born, doubtless, are the vital airs , for they are the first-born Brahman ;--'with the measure, the width of the sky!'--that is, 'as great as the sky is, so much in width may they broaden thee!'-- 'And he, the upholder, and the overlord,'--these two are speech and mind, for these two uphold everything here;--'may they all, of one mind, settle thee, and the Sacrificer, on the back of the firmament, in the world of heaven!' as the text, so its import.
6	1	6	Then on the right (south) side (he lays down one ), with , 'Wide-ruling thou art, the southern region,' for wide-ruling indeed is that southern region;--'The divine Rudras are thine overlords,' for the divine Rudras are indeed the overlords of that region;--'Indra is the repeller of shafts,' for Indra, indeed, is here the repeller of shafts;--'The Pañkadasa-stoma may uphold thee on earth!' for by the fifteenfold hymn it is indeed upheld on earth;--'The Praüga-sastra may support thee for steadiness’ sake!' for by the Praüga-sastra it is indeed supported on earth for steadiness’ sake;--'the Brihat-sâman for stability in the air!' for by the Brihat-sâman it is indeed established in the air;--'May the Rishis, the first-born, magnify thee among gods . . .!' the import of this (and the rest) has been explained.
6	1	7	Then behind (he lays down one), with , 'All-ruling thou art, the western region,' for all-ruling indeed is that western region;--'The divine Âdityas are thine overlords,' for the divine Âdityas are indeed the overlords of that region;--'Varuna is the repeller of shafts,' for Varuna, indeed, is here the repeller of shafts;--'The Saptadasa-stoma may uphold thee onearth!' for by the seventeenfold hymn it is indeed upheld on earth;--'The Marutvatîya-sastra may support thee for steadiness’ sake!' for by the Marutvatîya-sastra it is indeed supported on earth for steadiness’ sake;--'the Vairûpa-sâman for stability in the air!' for by the Vairûpa-sâman it is indeed established in the air;--'May the Rishis, the first-born, magnify thee among the gods . . .!' the import of this has been explained.
6	1	8	Then on the left (north) side (he lays down one), with , 'Self-ruling thou art, the northern region,' for self-ruling that northern region indeed is; 'The divine Maruts are thine overlords,' for the divine Maruts are indeed the overlords of that region;--'Soma is the repeller of shafts,' for Soma, indeed, is here the repeller of shafts;--'The Ekavimsa-stoma may uphold thee on earth!' for by the twenty-one-fold hymn this one is indeed upheld on earth;--'The Nishkevalya-sastra may support thee for steadiness’ sake!' for by the Nishkevalya-sastra it is indeed supported on earth for steadiness’ sake;--'the Vairâga-sâman for stability in the air!' for by the Vairâga-sâman it is indeed established in the air;--'May the Rishis, the first-born, magnify thee among the gods . . .!' the import of this has been explained.
6	1	9	Then in the middle (he lays down one ), with , 'The sovereign mistress thou art, the Great region!' for the sovereign mistress that great region indeed is;--'the All-gods arethine overlords,' for the All-gods are indeed the overlords of that region;--'Brihaspati is the repeller of shafts,' for Brihaspati, indeed, is here the repeller of shafts;--'The Trinava- and Trayastrimsa-stomas may uphold thee on earth;'--for by the twenty-nine-fold and thirty-three-fold hymns this one is indeed upheld on earth;--'The Vaisvadeva- and Âgnimâruta-sastras may support thee for steadiness’ sake!' for by the Vaisvadeva- and Âgnimâruta-sastras it is indeed supported on earth for steadiness’ sake;--'May the Rishis, the first-born, magnify thee among the gods . . .!' the import of this has been explained.
6	1	10	Thus much, indeed, is the whole sacrifice, and the sacrifice is the self of the gods: it was after making the sacrifice their own self that the gods seated themselves on that firmament, in the world of heaven; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now, after making the sacrifice his own self, seat himself on that firmament, in the world of heaven.
6	1	11	He then lays down the Pañkakûdâ ('five-knobbed') bricks; for the Nâkasads are (parts of) the sacrifice, and so indeed are the Pañkakûdâs the sacrifice: the Nâkasads are these four sacrificial priests together with the Sacrificer as the fifth; and the Pañkakûdâs are the Hotrâs . Now the Hotrâs are additional (to the officiating staff, or to the Hotri) and whatever is additional is an excrescence (kûda); and hence, as they are five additional (bricks), they are (called) Pañkakûdâs .
6	1	12	And, again, as to why he lays down the Nâkasad-Pañkakûdâs;--it is for the sake of completeness; for the Nâkasads are the self, and the Pañkakûdâs the mate, and this, the mate, doubtless, is one half of the self; for when one is with his mate , then he is whole and complete.
6	1	13	And, again, as to why he lays down the Nâkasad-Pañkakûdâs;--the Nâkasads are the self, and the Pañkakûdâs are offspring (or subjects) . Now progeny is something additional to the self, and whatever is additional is an excrescence; and hence, as they are five additional ones, they are (called) Pañkakûdâs.
6	1	14	And, again, as to why he lays down the Nâkasad-Pañkakûdâs;--the Nâkasads are the regions, and the Pañkakûdâs, too, are the regions: what five regions there are on this side of yonder sun, they are the Nâkasads, and those which are on the other side are the Pañkakûdâs. Now those regions which are on the other side of yonder sun are additional, and what is additional is an excrescence (kûda): and hence, as they are five additional ones, they are called Pañkakûdâs.
6	1	15	And, again, as to why he lays down the Pañkakûdâs. Now, at that time the gods were afraid lest the fiends, the Rakshas, should destroythese worlds of theirs from above. They put those protectors over these worlds, to wit, those shafts and missiles; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now put those protectors over these worlds, to wit, those shafts and missiles.
6	1	16	He places one in front, with , 'This one in front, the yellow-haired one,'--Agni, no doubt, is in front; and as 'to his saying of him as (being) 'in front,' it is because they take him out (of the Gârhapatya hearth) towards the front , and attend upon him towards the front; and as to why he calls him yellow-haired, it is because Agni is, as it were, yellow;--'the sun-rayed one,' for Agni's rays are like those of the sun;--'and Rathagritsa and Rathaugas , his commander and his chieftain,' the two spring-months are these two;--'and the nymphs Puñgikasthalâ and Kratusthalâ ,'--'quarter and intermediate quarter,' said Mâhitthi; but army and battle these two are;--'mordacious beasts the shaft, manslaughter the missile,'--inasmuch as they fight in army and battle, those mordacious beasts are the shaft; 'manslaughter the missile,'--inasmuch as they slay one another, manslaughter is the missile;--'to them be homage!' it is to them he pays homage;--'be they gracious unto us!' they are indeed gracious to him;--'he whom we hate, and he who hates us,him we put into their jaws!' whomsoever he hates, and whoever hates him, him he puts into their jaws. 'N. N. I put into their jaws,' thus he may name him whom he hates, and thereafter he will not be there any more. Let him disregard this also, for indeed marked out of himself is he whom he who knows this hates.
6	1	17	Then on the right (south) side (he places one), with , 'This one on the right, the all-worker,' the all-worker is this Vâyu (the wind) who blows here, for he makes everything here; and because he speaks of him as (being) 'on the right,' therefore it is in the south that he blows most;--'and Rathasvana (chariot-noise) and Rathekitra (glorious on the chariot), his commander and chieftain;' these are the two summer-months;--'and the two nymphs, Menakâ and Sahaganyâ,'--'quarter and intermediate quarter,' said Mâhitthi; but these two are heaven and earth;--'Goblins the shaft, demons the missile;' for goblins indeed are here the shaft (weapon), and demons the missile;--'to them be homage . . .!' the import of this has been explained.
6	1	18	Then behind (in the west, he lays down a brick), with , 'This one behind, the all-embracer,'--the all-embracer, doubtless, is yonder sun; for as soon as he rises all this embracing space comes into existence; and because he speaks of him as (being) 'behind,' therefore one sees him only when he goes towards the back (west);--'and Rathaprota (fixed on the chariot) and Asamaratha (of matchless chariot), his commander and chieftain;' these are the two rainy months;--'and the nymphs Pramlokantî (the setting one) and Anumlokantî (the rising one),'--'quarter and intermediate quarter,' said Mâhitthi, but they are day and night, for these two set and rise; 'tigers the shaft, snakes the missile,' for indeed tigers are here the shaft, and snakes the missile;--'to them be homage . . .!' the import of this has been explained.
6	1	19	Then on the left (north) side (he places one), with , 'This one on the left, of ever flowing blessings;' on the left is the sacrifice; and as to why he speaks of it as 'on the left,' it is because the sacrifice is performed from the left (north) side; and as to why he speaks of it as 'of ever-flowing blessings (samyadvasu),' they do indeed flow together (samyanti) to the sacrifice, thinking, 'this is a blessing;'--'and Târkshya and Arishtanemi, his commander and chieftain,' these are the two autumn-months; 'and the nymphs Visvâkî (the all-inclined) and Ghritâkî (the ghee-inclined),'--'quarter and intermediate quarter,' said Mâhitthi, but they are the vedi (altar) and the offering-spoon, for the altar is all-inclined , and the offering-spoon is ghee-inclined;--'water the shaft, wind the missile,'--water indeed is here the shaft, and wind the missile, for from this side it blows hot, and from that side cold;--'to them be homage . . .!' the import of this has been explained.
6	1	20	Then in the middle (he lays down one), with , 'This one above, the boon-bestower ,' the one above, doubtless, is Parganya (the rain-god); and when he speaks of him as (being) 'above,' it is because Parganya is indeed above; and when he calls him the boon-bestower, it is because from there the boon, rain, food for creatures, is bestowed hitherwards;--'and Senagit (the conqueror of armies) and Sushena (leader of a fine army), his commander and chieftain,' these are the two winter-months;--'and the nymphs, Urvasî and Pûrvaskitti,'--'quarter and intermediate quarter,' said Mâhitthi, but they are oblation and dakshinâ (priest's sacrificial fee);--'thunder the shaft, lightning the missile,' for indeed thunder is here the shaft, and lightning the missile;--'to them be homage . . .!' the import of this has been explained.
6	1	21	These, then, are the shafts and missiles which the gods then put as protectors over these worlds, and as to offspring (or subjects ), they are the commander and chieftain; and as to the mates, they are those nymphs,--having thus become complete with offspring and with mates, the gods seated themselves on that firmament, in the world of heaven; and in like manner does the Sacrificer, having become complete with offspring and a mate, now seat himself on that firmament, in the world of heaven.
6	1	22	Now, these are ten (Nâkasad-Pañkakûdâ) bricks he lays down;--of ten, syllables the Virâg consists, and this layer is virâg (far-shining). There are, however, only five of them, for he lays them down by two and two. And, verily, they are prayers for prosperity to Agni (the fire-altar). He places them in the last layer, for this, the last, layer is the end of Agni: it is thus at the end that hepronounces the prayers for prosperity to Agni. There are five of them, for at the sacrifice there are five prayers for prosperity . Between (each) two he throws loose soil, for these two bricks being fires, he does so fearing lest these two fires should blaze up together. And, moreover, loose soil means food: it is thus by means of food that he brings about concord between them.
6	1	23	Now; then, as to the order of proceeding. Having laid down (a brick) in front, he lays down those on the right, behind, on the left, and in the middle. Then the upper ones: having first laid down one in front, he lays down those on the right, on the left, in the middle, and behind. And, indeed, the world of heaven is entered from below, for the gods, having at that time, closed up these worlds on all sides, entered the world of heaven from below; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now, having closed up these worlds on all sides, enter the world of heaven from below.
6	2	1	He lays down Khandasyâs  (bricks pertaining to the metres). Completed now was the entire Agni (fire-altar). He now wished for distinction ; for, indeed, heretofore he was not equal thereto, that he should sustain distinction; whence people here say even to this day, 'This one is not equal to sustain distinction, either in regard to kingship or to headmanship.' The gods bestowed on him this distinction, these Khandasyâs; for the metres (Khandas) are cattle, and cattle are food, and (a position of) distinction is food.
6	2	2	He lays down triplets, for the beast is threefold--father, mother, son; and, embryo, amnion, chorion; and food also is threefold--ploughing, rain, seed. One of them is an Atikhandas  (excessive metre); for even whilst being one, that one is beyond all the metres. And as to that distinction, it is this great hymn of praise ; and as to this great hymn of praise, it is these Khandasyâs.
6	2	3	Gâyatrî verses are the head thereof, Trishtubh verses the body, Gagatî verses the spine, and Paṅkti verses the wings; and of each of those Kakubh verses he takes four syllables , and adds them tothe Atikhandas: that is just (what makes) that Atikhandas (excessive metre). The others result in Gâyatrîs: this is just that fourscore of Gâyatrîs , the Brihatîs (make up) the Bârhata one, and the Ushnihs the Aushniha one. And as to the Vasa hymn , the two half-verses, the Aindrâgna (hymn), and the insertion, they are Atikhandas; and as tothe Nada-verse , the Sûdadohas, the pâda-appendages, and whatever Anushtubh matter there is, they make up the Anushtubhs.
6	2	4	Dvipadâ verses are the feet. Thus much is the great hymn of praise, and the great hymn of praise means distinction: the gods bestowed upon him (Agni) all that distinction, and so does this (Sacrificer) bestow upon him all that distinction.
6	2	5	And, again, as to why he lays down the Khandasyâs. The gods at that time saw that firmament, the world of heaven, to wit, those Stomabhâgâs, and entered it. Of those entering, Pragâpati enteredlast; and thus Pragâpati is the same as these Khandasyâs.
6	2	6	Gâyatrîs are his head; and as to its being Gâyatrîs, it is because the head is of Gâyatrî nature . There are three, for the head is threefold. He places them on the forepart (of the altar), for the head (of the animal or bird) is in front.
6	2	7	Trishtubhs are the chest: he places them on the range of the two Retahsik; for the Retahsik are the ribs, and the ribs lie against the chest.
6	2	8	Gagatîs are the hips; at whatever distance from the naturally-perforated (central) brick he places the Trishtubhs in front, at the same distance from it he places the Gagatîs behind; for that naturally-perforated brick is this vital air in the middle (of the body), and as far from that vital air as the chest is in front, so far are the hips behind.
6	2	9	Anushtubhs are the thighs: he places them close to the Gagatîs, and thereby places the thighs close to the hips.
6	2	10	Brihatîs are the ribs, Kakubhs the breast-bone. The Brihatîs he places between the Trishtubhs and Kakubhs, whence these ribs are fastened on both sides, on the breast-bone and the costal cartilages .
6	2	11	Ushnihs are the neck: he places them close to the Gâyatrîs, and thereby places the neck close to the head.
6	2	12	Paṅktis are the wings: and as to their being Paṅktis, it is because the wings are of Paṅkti (fivefold) nature. He places them sideways, for these wings are sideways. Whatever metre is larger that he places on the right side: he thus makes the right half of the animal the stronger, and hence the right side of an animal is the stronger.
6	2	13	An Atikhandas is the belly; for the metres are cattle, and cattle are food, and food is (what fills) the belly, because it is the belly that eats the food: hence when the belly gets the food, it becomes eaten and used up. And inasmuch as this (brick) eats (atti) the metres (khandas), the cattle, it is called Attikhandas, for Attikhandas is really what is mystically called Atikhandas; for the gods love the mystic.
6	2	14	A (brick) covered with loose soil is the womb. These two he lays close to each other, for the belly and the womb are close to each other. They are connected with loose soil, for loose soil means flesh, and both the belly and the womb are connected with flesh. The former is an Atikhandas, the latter a soil-bedded one (purîshavatî), for the belly is higher, and the womb lower.
6	2	15	He places them so as to extend eastwards, for in an easterly direction  this Agni (fire-altar) is built; and, moreover, in one moving forward, both the belly and the womb are moving forward. Outside the Stomabhâgâs (he places them), for the Stomabhâgâs are the heart, and the heart is highest, then (comes) the belly, then the womb.
6	2	16	He places them south of the naturally-perforated (brick). Now, in the first layer, he placesboth the belly and the womb north of the naturally-perforated one ; for that naturally-perforated one, indeed, is what this vital air in the middle (of the body) is: he thus places the belly and the womb on both sides of that (central) vital air, and hence the belly and the womb are on both sides of that central vital air.
6	2	17	The Dvipadâs are the feet (the stand);--and as to its being Dvipadâs (verses of two feet), it is because the feet are a pair. There are three (such verses), for a stand  (tripod) is threefold. He lays them down at the back, for the feet are at the back (of the body).
6	2	18	That body of his (Agni) is well-made;--and, indeed, for whomsoever they thus make that body of his so as to be well-made, he becomes possessed of that body of his as a well-made one; but for whomsoever they make it otherwise than that, for him they make that body of his so as to be ill-made, and he becomes possessed of an ill-made body.
6	2	19	It is with reference to this that these two sâma-nidhanas (finales of sâman-hymns) are uttered,--'The light (is) in the highest heaven of the gods,' and, 'The gods (are) in the highest heaven of thelight;'--for when on that occasion the gods were entering (heaven), Pragâpati was the last to enter: that is why he says, 'The light (is) in the highest heaven of the gods.' And as to why he says, 'The gods (are) in the highest heaven of light,'--the light, doubtless, is this Agni (the fire-altar), and it is on his highest layer that all the gods have thus entered: this is why he says, 'The gods are in the highest heaven of light.'
6	3	1	He lays down the Gârhapatya. For the gods, having obtained this much, thought they had succeeded. They spake, 'Whereby have we succeeded in this?'--'By means of the Gârhapatya,' they said; 'for, after building the Gârhapatya  and mounting thereon, we saw the first layer, from the first (we saw) the second, from the second the third, from the third the fourth, from the fourth the fifth, and from the fifth this one.'
6	3	2	They spake, 'Think ye upon this, how there may be success here for us!' They spake, 'Meditate ye (kit)!' whereby, indeed, they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer (kiti)! seek ye whereby there may be success here for us!'
6	3	3	Whilst meditating, they said this: 'Let us bring this one here and put it on (the fire-altar)!' Having brought this (Gârhapatya) here, they put iton. They disputed about it:--in the front part (of the fifth layer) the Vasus, on the right side the Rudras, on the hind part the Âdityas, on the left side the Maruts, and above it the Visve Devâs said. 'Here let us lay it down! here. let us lay it down!'
6	3	4	They spake, 'Let us lay it down in the middle: when laid down in our midst, it will belong to all of us.' They laid it down in the middle (of the fifth layer), and thus they laid that success into the self (or the body of the altar);--in the middle (they laid it): they thus laid that success into the very middle of (Agni's and their own) self. And in like manner does the Sacrificer, when he lays down the Gârhapatya, lay that success into (his own) self; and (by laying it down) in the middle, he lays that success into the very middle of the self.
6	3	5	And, again, as to why he lays down the Gârhapatya. The Gârhapatya, doubtless, is food, and this built Agni is an eater: it is to the eater he thus offers that food;--in the centre (he lays down the Gârhapatya): in the very middle (of the body) he thus lays food into him.
6	3	6	And, again, as to why he lays down the Gârhapatya. The world of the gods, doubtless, is the Vedi (altar-ground); but that (original Gârhapatya) is built up outside the Vedi: thus, when he brings it here and lays it down (on the fire-altar), he then establishes it (or him, Agni) on the Vedi, in the world of the gods.
6	3	7	And, again, as to why he lays down the Gârhapatya. The lotus-leaf , doubtless, is a womb, butthat (Gârhapatya) is built up outside the womb, and outside of the womb indeed takes place that performance regarding the fire-altar which takes place prior to the (laying down of the) lotus-leaf: thus, when they bring it (the Gârhapatya) here and lay it down, he then establishes it in the womb. on the lotus-leaf; and thus indeed it is not outside. Eight bricks he lays down: the significance of this has been explained . He builds it up with the same formulas and in the same order, for this one is the same as that (former Gârhapatya Agni) he thus brings it (or him) here and lays it down.
6	3	8	He then lays down the Punaskiti . Now at that time the gods, having built the Gârhapatya, did not find success therein; for the Gârhapatya pile is a womb, and success in a womb consists in seed, in generative power; and in this womb they saw no seed, no generative power.
6	3	9	They spake, 'Think ye upon this, how we may lay seed and generative power into this womb!' They spake, 'Meditate ye!' whereby, indeed, they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer! seek ye that we may lay seed and generative power into this womb!'
6	3	10	Whilst meditating, they saw this Punaskiti, and put it on (the Gârhapatya), and thereby laid seed and generative power into this womb;--in the centre (they placed it): they thus laid seed andgenerative power into the very middle of this womb. And in like manner does the Sacrificer now, when he lays down the Punaskiti, lay seed and generative power into this womb;--in the centre (he lays it down): he thus lays seed and generative power into the very middle of this womb.
6	3	11	Now some lay it down on the hind part (of the bird-like altar), because it is from the hind part that seed is introduced,--(to wit) on the juncture of the tail (and the body), for it is from (the part near) the tail that seed is introduced. Let him not do this, for they who do this lay seed and generative power outside the womb; but let him rather place it in the centre: he thus lays seed and generative power right into the womb.
6	3	12	He lays down eight bricks,--the Gâyatrî (metre) consists of eight syllables, and Agni (the fire-altar) is of Gâyatrî nature: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great he thus introduces him in the form of seed. Five times he 'settles' it,--of five layers consists the fire-altar, five seasons make a year, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus introduces him in the form of seed. Eight bricks he 'settles' five times, that makes thirteen,--thirteen months make a year, and there are thirteen 'layer-fillings' of the altar: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great he thus becomes.
6	3	13	And as to why he lays down the Punaskiti. Now, in laying down the Gârhapatya (hearth) upon the Âhavanîya, he surely does what is improper; but when he lays down the Punaskiti he thereby brings this Agni (or altar) that has been built, and builds it up again thereon; and because he again (punas) builds up (ki) that (Agni) already built, therefore (this is called) Punaskiti.
6	3	14	Now some lay down the Gârhapatya on the hind part, and the Punaskiti on the front part (of the built altar), for these two are the Âhavanîya and the Gârhapatya, and these two fires are (placed) in this way . Let him not do this, for the Gârhapatya is this (terrestrial) world, and the Âhavanîya is the sky; and above this (earth) surely is yonder (sky); let him therefore place it (the Punaskiti) on the top of that (Gârhapatya).
6	3	15	And as to why he lays down both the Gârhapatya and the Punaskiti. These two, doubtless, are the Vedi and the Uttaravedi (high-altar) of Agni. Now those two former (altars of this kind) which he throws up  belong to the Soma-sacrifice, but these belong to the fire-altar; and when, after laying down these two; he deposits Agni (the fire) thereon, then he establishes him both on the Vedi and the Uttaravedi.
6	3	16	And, again, as to why he lays down the Punaskiti. This, doubtless, is a repeated sacrifice (punaryagña), and higher (than the ordinary sacrifice) is this worship of the gods: he thus sets up a repeated sacrifice, and the higher worship of the gods; and the repeated sacrifice inclines (accrues) to him.
6	3	17	And, again, as to why he lays down the Punaskiti. This (altar), doubtless, is that same Agni whom in the beginning the vital airs, the Rishis, made up . He now builds him up again; and inasmuch as he again (punas) builds up (ki) that (Agni) already built, therefore also it is (called) Punaskiti.
6	3	18	, 'With what fervour the Rishis entered upon the sacrificial session,'--he thereby means those Rishis (the vital airs);--'kindling the fire and gaining the light,'--that is, 'kindling the fire, and gaining the heavenly world;'--'upon that firmament I place the Fire,'--the firmament, doubtless, is the heavenly world;--'whom thinkers call the straw-spreader,'--the thinkers (or men) are they who are wise; and 'straw-spreader' he says, because he (Agni) has ever the (sacrificial) straw spread for him.
6	3	19	, 'With our wives let us follow him, O gods! with our sons and brothers, or our golden treasures;'--that is, 'let us follow him with our all;'--'gaining the firmament in the world of righteousness;'--the firmament, doubtless, is the heavenly world: thus, 'gaining the heavenly world in the world of righteousness;'--'above the third luminous back of the sky,'--for this, indeed, is the third luminous back of the sky where this (Agni) now burns .
6	3	20	, 'Unto the centre of speech did he mount, the nimble,'--for this, indeed, is the centre of speech where he now is built up; and 'the nimble (bhuranyu),' that is, 'the sustainer  (bhartar);'--'this Agni, the good lord, the heedful,'--that is, 'this Agni, the lord of the good, the heeding one;'--'established upon the back of the earth, he the brilliant,'--that is, 'established on the back of the earth, the shining one;'--'let him tread under foot any hostile!'--that is, 'let him tread under foot all evildoers.'
6	3	21	, 'This Agni, the most mettlesome bestower of strength,'--that is, 'the most vigorous bestower of strength; may he glow a thousandfold, unremitting,'--that is, 'may he shine a thousandfold, not unheedful;'--'blazing in the middle of the sea,'--the sea, doubtless, means these worlds: thus, 'shining in these worlds;'--'go forth to the divine abodes!'--that is, 'go forth to the heavenly world!
6	3	22	, 'Gather ye together! draw ye nigh together!'--he thereby says to those Rishis, 'Gather ye him together! draw ye nigh to him together!'--'Make ye Agni's  paths to lead to the gods!'--as the text so the meaning;--'making the parentsyoung again,'--the young parents, doubtless, are speech and mind, and these two fires also are speech and mind;--'in thee hath he spun out this thread,'--he thereby means that thread (of the sacrifice) which has been spun out by the Rishis.
6	3	23	, 'Awake, O Agni, and be watchful!'--he thereby says to this Agni, 'Wake thou over this one , and watch thou over him! Wish and fulfilment, meet ye and he together !'--as the text, so the meaning;--'Upon this, the higher seat,'--the higher seat, doubtless, is the sky;--'sit ye down, O All-gods, and the Sacrificer!'--he thereby makes the Sacrificer sit down together with the Visve Devâs.
6	3	24	, 'Whereby thou carriest a thousand, whereby, O Agni, all wealth,'--for that, indeed, is his most acceptable power whereby he carries a thousand, and all wealth;--'thereby lead thou this sacrifice of ours unto the light to go to the gods!'--that is, 'thereby lead thou this our sacrifice to the heavenly world to go to the gods.'--, 'This is thy natural womb . . .;'--the meaning of this has beenexplained . Eight bricks he lays down: the meaning of this also has been explained .
7	1	1	He lays down two Ritavyâ (seasonal bricks). The seasonal (bricks) are the same as these seasons: it is the seasons he thereby lays down. And, indeed, the seasonal ones are everything here, for the seasonal ones are the year, and the year is everything here: he thus lays down everything here. And generative power they also are,--for the seasonal ones are the year, and the year means generative power: it is generative power he thus lays down (or bestows on Agni and the Sacrificer).
7	1	2	And, again, as to why he lays down seasonal (bricks),--the seasonal (ones) are the nobility and these other bricks are the peasantry: he thus places the nobility as the eater among the peasantry. He lays down (some of) them in all the layers: he thus places the nobility as the eater among the whole people .
7	1	3	And, again, as to why he lays down seasonal (bricks),--this fire-altar is the year, and it is joined together by means of the seasonal (bricks): he thus makes the year continuous, and joins it together, by means of the seasons. These (formulas of the seasonal bricks) begin in a different way, but end in the same way; for the seasons were created, and, when created, they were different.
7	1	4	They spake, 'While being thus, we shall not beable to procreate: let us unite with our forms!' They united in each single season with their forms, whence there is in each single season the form of all the seasons. As to their (formulas) beginning in a different way, it is because they were created different (or separately); and as to their ending in the same way, it is because they united with their forms.
7	1	5	He lays them down, with , 'Tapa and Tapasya, the two dewy seasons,'--these are the names of these two: it is thus by their names that he lays them down. Tapa (the burner), doubtless, is yonder sun: from him these two seasons are not separated; and inasmuch as these two seasons are not separated from him, they are called Tapa and Tapasya.
7	1	6	'Agni's coupling-link thou art,'--this fire-altar is the year, and it is joined together by means of the seasonal (bricks): he thus makes the year continuous, and joins it together by means of the seasons;--'May Heaven and earth fit into one another! may the waters and plants fit into each other!'--he thereby makes everything here  to fit in by means of the seasons:--'May the fires fit into one another, each singly, working harmoniously together for my supremacy!'--for these single bricks are the same as those fires: he thus says this so that they may fit in with each other for the supremacy of those two seasons:--'whatever fires there are, at one with each other, within these two, Heaven and Earth;'--as the text is, so is its meaning;--'let them drawtogether, fitting in with the two dewy seasons, even as the gods draw together unto Indra;'--that is, 'even as the gods are drawing together round Indra, so may they draw together for supremacy round these two seasons.' Two bricks there are, because the season consists of two months. Only once he 'settles' them: he thereby makes the season to be one.
7	1	7	And as to why he now lays down these two;--this fire-altar is the year, and the year is these worlds: the fifth layer of this (altar) is the sky, and the dewy season of this (year) is the sky; and when he now lays down these two (bricks), he thereby restores to his (Agni's) body what these two are thereto: this is why he now lays down these two (bricks).
7	1	8	And, again, as to why he now lays down these two;--this Agni (the fire-altar) is Pragâpati (the lord of generation), and Pragâpati is the year: the fifth layer is his (Agni's) head, and the dewy season is its (the year's) head; and when he now lays down these two (bricks), he thereby restores to his (or its) body what these two are thereto: this is why he now lays down these two (bricks).
7	1	9	He lays down the two seasonal ones prior to the naturally-perforated one and to the Visvagyotis; for the last naturally-perforated one is the sky , and the last Visvagyotis  (all-light brick) isthe sun: he thus places the seasons on this side of the sky and the sun; whence the seasons are on this side thereof. But generative power there also is (in these seasonal bricks) : he thus places generative power on this side of the sky and the sun; whence procreation takes place only on this side of them, but stationary, indeed, is procreation beyond them, for just as many gods as there were of old, so many there are now.
7	1	10	Now, the (first) two seasonal (bricks) he lays down subsequently to the first naturally-perforated one, and to the first Visvagyotis; for the first naturally-perforated one is this (earth), and the first Visvagyotis is Agni: thereupon he places the seasons, whence the seasons are upwards from this (earth). But generative power there also is therein: he thus places generative power above this (earth); whence procreation only takes place above (upon, not under) this (earth).
7	1	11	Let him not derange these (seasonal bricks)  lest he should derange the seasons, for deranged arethe seasons for him who dies: hence, in whatever place he lays down the first two, there let him lay down all.
7	1	12	But the seasonal (bricks), indeed, are also these (three) worlds: by the (different) layers he thus builds up these worlds one above the other. And the seasonal (bricks), indeed, are also the nobility: by the (different) layers he thus builds up the nobility above (the peasantry). And the seasonal ones, indeed, are also the year: by the (different) layers he thus builds up the year. Let him not thereafter place over them any other brick with a sacrificial formula, lest he should place the peasantry above the nobility.
7	1	13	Now these same (bricks) are indeed steppingstones, for by means of the seasonal (bricks) the gods then stepped over these worlds, hath from hence upwards and from above downwards: and in like manner does the Sacrificer now, by means of the seasonal (bricks), step over these worlds, both from hence upwards and from above downwards.
7	1	14	Now, the Karakâdhvaryus lay down here yet other 'stepping-stones'; but let him not do so, for they do what is redundant, and these are indeed (all) the stepping-stones.
7	1	15	He then lays down a Visvagyotis (all-light brick);--the last Visvagyotis, doubtless, is the sun, for in yonder (celestial) world the sun, indeed, is 'all the light': it is the sun he thereby sets up.
7	1	16	And, again, as to why he lays down a Visvagyotis:--the Visvagyotis, doubtless, means progeny, for progeny indeed is all the light:--he thus lays generative power into it (or into him, Agni and the Sacrificer).
7	1	17	He lays down the Visvagyotis prior to the naturally-perforated one;--for the last naturally-perforated one is the sky, and the last Visvagyotis is the sun: he thus places the sun on this side (below) the sky, whence he burns only on this side thereof. But there also is generative power therein: he thus places generative power on this side of the sky, whence procreation takes place only on this side thereof.
7	1	18	Now the (first) Visvagyotis he lays down subsequent to the first naturally-perforated one; for the first naturally-perforated one is this (earth), and the first Visvagyotis is Agni: he thus sets up Agni upwards from this (earth), whence the fire blazes upwards from here. But there also is generative power therein: he thus places generative power above this (earth), whence procreation only takes place above this (earth).
7	1	19	And the (second) Visvagyotis he lays down subsequent to the second naturally-perforated one (in the third, or central) layer; for the second naturally-perforated one is the air, and the second Visvagyotis is Vâyu (the wind): he thus places the wind in the air, whence that wind (has his abode) in the air.
7	1	20	These (three) then are the lights;--and when he lays down these (three Visvagyotis bricks) in this way, he thereby sets up those same lights so as to face each other; and hence the fire blazes upwards from this (earth), and yonder sun shines downwards, and that wind blows sideways in the air.
7	1	21	, 'May Parameshthin settle thee'--for Parameshthin saw this fifth layer;--'on the backof the sky, thee, the luminous one!'--for on the back of the sky is yonder luminous sun.
7	1	22	'For all out-breathing, and off-breathing, and through-breathing,'--for the Visvagyotis is the breath, and breath, indeed, is (necessary) for everything here;--'bestow thou all the light!'--that is, 'bestow thou the whole (or every) light;'--'Sûrya is thine overlord,'--he thereby makes Sûrya (the sun) its overlord. Having 'settled' it, he pronounces the Sûdadohas on it: its (symbolical) meaning has been told .
7	1	23	Now, these (bricks) are indeed stepping-stones, for by means of the Visvagyotis (bricks) the gods then stepped over these worlds, both from hence upwards, and from above downwards: and in like manner does the Sacrificer now, by means of the Visvagyotis, step over these worlds, both from hence upwards, and from above downwards.
7	1	24	Now, the Karakâdhvaryus lay down here yet other 'stepping-stones'; but let him not do so, for they do what is redundant, and these are indeed the stepping-stones.
7	2	1	He then lays down a Lokamprinâ  (space-filling brick); the Lokamprinâ, doubtless, is yondersun, for he fills these worlds: it is thus yonder sun he thereby sets up. He lays down this (Lokamprinâ) in all the (five) layers, for those layers are these (three) worlds : he thus places the sun in (all) these worlds, whence he shines for all these worlds.
7	2	2	And, again, as to why he lays down a Lokamprinâ,--the Lokamprinâ, doubtless, is the nobility (or chieftaincy) , and these other bricks are the peasants (or clansmen): he thus places the nobility (or chieftain), as the eater, among the peasantry. He lays it down in all the layers: he thus places the nobility, as the eater, among the whole peasantry (or in every clan).
7	2	3	Now this is only a single (brick): he thus makes the nobility (or the chieftaincy) and (social) distinction to attach to a single (person). And what second (such brick there is) that is its mate,--a mate, doubtless, is one half of one's own self, for when one is with a mate then he is whole and complete: (thus it is laid down) for the sake of completeness. With a single formula he lays down many bricks : he thereby endows the nobility preeminentlywith power , and makes the nobility more powerful than the peasantry. And the other (bricks) he lays down singly, with separate formulas: he thereby makes the peasantry less powerful than the nobility, differing in speech, and of different thoughts (from one another).
7	2	4	The first two (Lokamprinâs) he lays down in that (south-east) corner: he thereby places yonder sun in that quarter: from this (earth) he follows him (the sun) from that (place) there ; from this (earth) he follows him from that (place) there; from this (earth) he follows hire from that (place) there; from this (earth) he follows him from that (place) there.
7	2	5	And in whatever place he lays down the first two (bricks), let him there lay down alongside ofthem the last two (bricks): for (otherwise) having once revolved round these worlds, that sun would not pass by them. Let him lay down the two last alongside the two first by reaching over them: he thus causes that sun to pass by these worlds; and hence that sun revolves incessantly round these worlds again and again (from left) to right.
7	2	6	, 'Fill the space! fill the gap!'--that is, 'fill up the space! fill up the gap;'--'and lie thou steady!'--that is, 'and lie thou firm, settled!'--'Indra and Agni, and Brihaspati, have settled thee in this womb;' that is, 'Indra and Agni, and Brihaspati, have established thee in this womb.' Thus (he establishes them) by an anushtubh verse; for the Anushtubh is speech, and Indra is speech, and the space-filler is Indra. He does not settle them, for that (sun) is unsettled. He pronounces the Sûdadohas on them, for the Sûdadohas is vital air: he thus makes him (Agni) continuous and joins him together by means of the vital air.
7	2	7	Here now they say, 'How does that Lokamprinâ become of unimpaired strength?' Well, the Lokamprinâ is yonder sun, and he assuredly is of unimpaired strength. And the Lokamprinâ also is speech, and of unimpaired strength assuredly is speech.
7	2	8	Having laid down those (bricks) possessed of (special) sacrificial formulas, he covers (the altar) with the Lokamprinâ; for the bricks possessed of formulas mean food, and the Lokamprinâ means the body: he thus encloses the food in the body, whence food enclosed in the body is the body itself.
7	2	9	Those (bricks) possessed of formulas he places on the body (of the altar) itself, not on the wings and tail: he thus puts food into the body; and whatever food is put into the body that benefits both the body and the wings and tail; but that which he puts on the wings and tail benefits neither the body, nor the wings and tail.
7	2	10	On the body (of the altar) he places both (bricks) possessed of formulas and Lokamprinâs; whence that body (of a bird) is, as it were, twice as thick. On the wings and tail (he places) only Lokamprinâs, whence the wings and tail are, as it were, thinner. On the body (of the altar) he places them both lengthwise and crosswise, for the bricks are bones: hence these bones in the body run both lengthwise and crosswise. On the wings and tail (he places them so as to be) turned away (from the body), for in the wings and tail there is not a single transverse bone. And this, indeed, is the difference between a built and an unbuilt (altar): suchlike is the built one, different therefrom the unbuilt one .
7	2	11	The Svayamâtrinnâ (naturally-perforated brick) he encloses with Lokamprinâ (bricks); for the naturally-perforated one is the breath, and the 'space-filler' is the sun: he thus kindles the breath by means of the sun, whence this breath (of ours) is warm. With that (kind of brick) he fills up the whole body: he thereby kindles the whole body by means of the sun, whence this whole body (of ours) is warm. And this, indeed, is the difference between one that will live and one that will die:he that will live is warm, and he that will die is cold.
7	2	12	From the corner in which he lays down the first two (Lokamprinâs) he goes on filling up (the altar) by tens up to the Svayamâtrinnâ. In the same way he goes on filling it up from left to right behind the naturally-perforated one up to (the brick on) the cross-spine . He then fills it up whilst returning to that limit .
7	2	13	The body (of the altar) he fills up first, for of (a bird) that is produced, the body is produced first, then the right wing, then the tail, then the left (wing): that is in the rightward (sunwise) way, for this is (the way) with the gods, and thus, indeed, yonder sun moves along these worlds from left to right.
7	2	14	The Lokamprinâ, doubtless, is the same as the vital air; he therewith fills up the whole body (of the altar): he thus puts vital air into the whole body. If he were not to reach any member thereof, then the vital air would not reach that member of him (Agni); and whatever member the vital air does not reach, that, assuredly, either dries up or withers away: let him therefore fill up therewith the whole of it.
7	2	15	The wings and tail he builds on to the body, for the wings and tail grow on to the body; but were he first to lay down those (bricks) turned away (from the body), it would be as if he were to take a limb from elsewhere and put it on again.
7	2	16	Let him not lay down either a broken (brick) or a black one; for one that is broken causes failure, and sickly is that form which is black: 'Lest I should make up a sickly body,' he thinks . Let him not throw aside an unbroken (brick), lest he should put what is not sickly outside the body. Whatever (bricks), in counting from the dhishnya hearths, should exceed a Virâg , and not make up another, such (bricks) indeed cause failure: let him break them and throw them  (ut-kir) on the heap of rubbish (utkara), for the heap of rubbish is the seat of what is redundant: thus he thereby settles them where there is. the seat of that which is redundant.
7	2	17	Now, then, of the measures of the bricks. In the first and last layers let him lay down (bricks) of a foot (square), for the foot is a support; and the hand is the same as the foot. The largest (bricks) should be of the measure of the thigh-bone, for there is no bone larger than the thigh-bone. Three layers should have (their bricks) marked with three lines, for threefold are these worlds; and two (layersmay consist) of (bricks) marked with an indefinite number of lines, for these two layers are the flavour, and the flavour is indefinite; but all (the layers) should rather have (bricks) marked with three lines, for threefold are all these worlds.
7	2	18	Now, then, of the location  of (special) bricks. Any (special) brick he knows, provided with a formula, let him place in the middle (third) layer; for the middle layer is the air, and the air, doubtless, is the location of all beings. Moreover, bricks with (special) formulas are food, and the middle layer is the belly: he thus puts food into the belly.
7	2	19	Here, now, they say, 'Let him not lay down (such special bricks) lest he should do what is excessive.' But he may, nevertheless, lay them down; for such bricks are laid down for (the fulfilment of special) wishes, and in wishes there is nothing excessive. But let him rather not lay them down, for just that much the gods then did.
7	3	1	He now throws loose soil (on the layer); for the loose soil means flesh: he thus covers him (Agni) with flesh.  after having laid down the bricks;--the bricks are the bone: he thus covers the bone with flesh.
7	3	2	He also strews it on (the place where lies) the naturally-perforated (brick), for the naturally-perforated one means vital air, and the loose soilmeans food: he thus puts food into (the channels of) the vital air. In that manner  he covers the whole body (of the altar); whence the food which is put into (the channels of) the vital air benefits the whole body, extends over the whole body.
7	3	3	'Let him not strew it on (the place of) the naturally-perforated one,' say some, 'lest he should stop up (the channels of) the vital airs, for the naturally-perforated one is the vital air.' Let him, nevertheless, strew it, for the vital airs are sustained by food, and whoever eats no food his (channels of the) vital airs grow up (and close): hence he for whom they act thus, comes to exist in yonder world even like a dry, hollow tube. Let him, therefore, by all means strew (loose soil) on (the place of) the naturally-perforated one.
7	3	4	Having strewed it on the svayamâtrinnâ (place) he goes on covering (the altar) from the (brick) on the cross-spine up to the enclosing-stones. In the same way he goes on covering it from left to right behind the naturally-perforated one up to the one on the cross-spine again.
7	3	5	The body (of the altar) he covers first, for of (a bird) that is produced, the body is the first to be produced; then the right wing, then the tail, then the left wing: that is in the rightward (sunwise) way, for this is (the way) with the gods.
7	3	6	Now this loose soil, indeed, is the vital air; he therewith covers the whole body: he thus puts vital air into the whole body. And, assuredly, whatsoever member thereof he should not reach, that member of him (Agni) the vital air would notreach; and whatever member the vital air does not reach that either dries up or withers away: let him, therefore, cover it entirely therewith.
7	3	7	, 'They all have magnified Indra,'--for all beings, indeed, magnify Indra;--'the voices, him, of ocean-wide extent,'--he thereby alludes to his greatness;--'the foremost of charioteers,'--for of charioteers he is the greatest charioteer;--'the lordly lord of viands,'--viands mean food: thus, 'the lordly lord of food.' With this anushtubh verse addressed to Indra he scatters it; for the loose soil belongs to Indra: that (layer of) loose soil is one half of Agni (the fire-altar), the (other) half is the collection of bricks.
7	3	8	Here, now, they say, 'Whilst he lays down the bricks with all kinds of metres, and with (verses addressed to) all deities, he now scatters (the soil) with a single (verse) addressed to a single deity,--how is this one half of Agni?' Indra, surely, is equal to all the gods; hence in that he scatters it with a (verse) addressed to Indra, this (soil) is one half of Agni. And as to its being (done) with an anushtubh verse,--the Anushtubh is speech, and all metres are speech: thereby also it is one half.
7	3	9	He then lays down the Vikarnî and Svayamâtrinnâ (bricks),--the Vikarnî is Vâyu (the wind), and the last naturally-perforated one is the sky: he thus sets up both the wind and the sky. He lays them down as the last (highest), for wind and sky are the highest; and close together, for wind andsky are close together. The Vikarnî he lays down first: he thereby places the wind on this side of the sky; whence that wind blows only on this side (thereof).
7	3	10	And, again, as to why he lays down the Vikarnî. When, on that (former) occasion, they make the horse smell (the pile of bricks of) the (first) layer , then yonder sun strings these worlds to himself on a thread. Now that thread is the same as the wind; and that wind is the same as this Vikarnî: thus when he lays down the latter, then yonder sun strings to himself these worlds on a thread.
7	3	11	And, again, as to why he lays down the Vikarnî and the Svayamâtrinnâ; the Vikarnî, doubtless, is vital power, and the naturally-perforated one is vital air: he thus bestows both vital power and vital air. He lays them down as the two last (highest bricks), because vital power and vital air are the two highest (endowments); and close together, because vital power and vital air are closely (bound) together. The upper (northern) Vikarnî he lays down first : he thereby encloses the vital air on both sides in vital power.
7	3	12	, 'When, like a snorting steed, that longeth for the pasture, he started forth from the great enclosure, then the wind fanned his flame, and black then was thy path;'--for when the wind fans his (Agni's) flame,then his path does become black. With a trishtubh verse he lays it down, because Vâyu (the wind) is of trishtubh nature; with one relating to Agni, because it is Agni's performance; with an undefined one, because Vâyu is undefined. And as to his saying 'the wind,' Vâyu indeed is the wind.
7	3	13	He then lays down the Svayamâtrinnâ, with , 'I seat thee in the seat of the vital power,'--the vital power, doubtless, is yonder (sun), and his seat this is;--'the animating,'--for he (the sun) animates all this universe;--'in the shadow,'--for in his shadow all this universe is;--'in the heart of the sea,'--for this, indeed, is the heart of the (aerial) sea ;--'the radiant, the luminous,'--for radiant and luminous is the sky;--'thou that illumines the sky, the earth and the wide air;'--for thus, indeed, does he (the sun) illumine these worlds.
7	3	14	'May Parameshthin settle thee,'--for Parameshthin saw this fifth layer .
7	3	15	And, again, as to why he lays it down by means of Parameshthin. When Pragâpati had become disjointed, the deities took him and went off in different directions. Parameshthin took his head, and kept going away from him.
7	3	16	He spake to him, 'Come to me and restore unto me that wherewith thou hast gone from me!'--'What will therefrom accrue to me?'--'That part of my body shall be sacred to thee!'--'So be it!' So Parameshthin restored that to him.
7	3	17	Now that last self-perforated (brick) is justthat part of him (Pragâpati-Agni); and when he now lays it down in this place, he thereby restores to him what part of his body this is: that is why he lays it down in this place.
7	3	18	'On the back of the sky, thee, the wide and broad one!'--for this (top of the altar) is indeed the back of the sky, and it is both wide and broad ;--'Sustain thou the sky! make firm the sky! injure not the sky!'--that is, 'Sustain thy self, make firm thy self, injure not thy self (body)!'
7	3	19	'For all out-breathing, off-breathing, through-breathing, up-breathing!'--the naturally-perforated (brick) is the vital air, and the vital air truly serves for everything here;--'for a resting-place, for a moving-place!'--the naturally-perforated (bricks) are these worlds, and these worlds are the resting-place and the moving-place;--'May Sûrya guard thee,'--that is, 'May Sûrya protect thee,'--'with mighty well-being,'--that is, 'with great well-being;'--'with the safest roof!'--that is, 'with whatever roof (abode) is the safest.'
7	3	20	Separately he lays them down, for separate are wind and sky; and once only he 'settles' them: he thereby makes them the same, for vital power and vital air are the same. They are both of them stones and both of them naturally-perforated; for vital power and vital air are the same. He then pronounces the Sûdadohas over them,--the Sûdadohas means vital air; he thus makes themcontinuous, joins them together by means of the vital air.
7	3	21	'Those his well-like milking ones '--a well (sûda) means water, and milking means food;--'the speckled ones mix the Soma,'--the speckled (cow) means food;--'at the birth of the gods,'--the birth of the gods is the year;--'the tribes,' the tribes (vis), doubtless, are the sacrifice, for all beings are ranged (vishta)  under the sacrifice;--'in the three spheres of the heavens,'--the three spheres of the heavens, doubtless, are the (three) pressings (of Soma): he thus means the pressings. With an anushtubh verse (he performs this rite), for the Anushtubh is speech, and speech (includes) all vital airs; and by means of speech, that is vital air, he thus makes these two (bricks) continuous, and joins them together. This same Sûdadohas, whilst being a single (verse), extends over all the bricks, whence--the Sûdadohas being the vital air--this vital air, whilst being one only, extends over all the limbs, over the whole body.
7	4	1	On the (three) naturally-perforated (bricks) he (the Sacrificer) sings sâmans; for the naturally-perforated ones are these (three) worlds; and theyare just these (ordinary) stones. The gods, having laid them down, saw them as such: that they were dry stones.
7	4	2	They spake, 'Think ye upon this, how we may lay sap, the means of subsistence, into these worlds!' They spake, 'Meditate ye!' whereby, doubtless, they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer! seek ye how we may lay sap, the means of subsistence, into these worlds!'
7	4	3	Whilst meditating, they saw these sâmans (hymn-tunes), and sang them; and by means of them they laid sap, the means of subsistence, into these worlds; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now, when he sings these sâmans, lay sap, the means of subsistence, into these worlds.
7	4	4	Over the naturally-perforated ones he sings them: the naturally-perforated ones being these worlds, it is into these worlds that he thereby lays sap, the means of subsistence.
7	4	5	He sings (the tunes) on the (mystic) words 'Bhûs, Bhuvas, Svar';--bhûs (earth), doubtless, is this world, bhuvas is the air-world, and svar (light) is yonder world: into these worlds he thereby lays sap, the means of subsistence.
7	4	6	They have different preludes, and the same finale ; and as to their having different preludes, itis because they (the gods) saw them separately; and as to their having the same finale (nidhana), it is because there is only one foundation, only one finale to the sacrifice--even heaven: therefore they have 'svar-gyotis (heaven-light)' for their finale.
7	4	7	He then bestrews him (Agni, the fire-altar and Agni's body) with chips of gold. Now that whole Agni had been completed, and the gods bestowed on him immortality, that highest form; and in like manner does this one now bestow upon him that highest, immortal form .
7	4	8	And, again, as to why he bestrews him with chips of gold. Now on that former occasion he first lays into him that pleasing form, the gold plate and the (gold) man ; and he now decks him all over with a pleasing form.
7	4	9	With two hundred (chips he bestrews him) each time,--two-footed is the Sacrificer, and Agniis the sacrificer: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus bestows upon him immortality, that highest form. Five times (he strews),--five-layered is the altar, five seasons make a year, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus bestows upon him immortality, that highest form. With a thousand (chips he bestrews him),--a thousand means everything: with everything he thus confers upon him immortality, that highest form.
7	4	10	First (he scatters them) at the back whilst standing with his face towards the east; then on the left (north) side towards the south; then in front whilst facing the west; then, having gone round the back, from the south whilst facing the north: this is from left to right (sunwise), for that is (the way) with the gods. Then, having gone round, (he scatters chips) at the back whilst standing with his face to the east, for in this way that former performance of him  took place.
7	4	11	, 'The fore-measure of a thousand thou art,--The counter-measure of a thousand thou art,--The up-measure of a thousand thou art,--The thousandfold thou art,--For a thousand thee!'--a thousand, doubtless, means everything: thus, 'Everything thou art,--thee for everything!'
7	4	12	Now, then, the consideration of the layer-fillings. The first layer is this (terrestrial) world; and the filling of soil means cattle: thus, incovering the first layer with a filling of soil he covers this (terrestrial) world with cattle.
7	4	13	The second layer is the air, and the filling of soil means birds: thus, in covering the second layer with a filling of soil, he covers (fills) the air with birds.
7	4	14	The third layer is the sky, and the filling of soil means stars; thus, in covering the third layer with a filling of soil, he covers the sky with stars.
7	4	15	The fourth layer is the sacrifice, and the filling of soil means sacrificial gifts: thus, in covering the fourth layer with a filling of soil, he covers the sacrifice with sacrificial gifts (to the priests).
7	4	16	The fifth layer is the Sacrificer, and the filling of soil means progeny (or subjects) thus, in covering the fifth layer with a filling of soil, he covers (abundantly supplies) the Sacrificer with progeny (or subjects).
7	4	17	The sixth layer is the heavenly world, and the filling of soil means the gods: thus in covering the sixth layer with a filling of soil, he fills the heavenly world with gods.
7	4	18	The seventh layer is immortality,--that is the last (layer) he lays down, and thus bestows immortality as the highest thing of all this (universe): therefore immortality is the highest thing of all this (universe); therefore the gods are not separated therefrom; and therefore they are immortal. Thus much as to the deity .
7	4	19	Now, as to the Self (body). The first layer is the legs, and the downward flowing vital air; andthe filling of soil is the flesh: thus, in covering the first layer with a filling of soil, he covers that (part) of his (Agni's) body with flesh.  after laying down bricks, and bricks mean bone: he thus covers the bone with flesh. He does not cover (the altar-site) below (the first layer), whence these vital airs are not closed up below; but, he covers it above, and thereby covers that (part) of his body above with flesh; and hence that (part) of his body above, being covered with flesh, is not visible.
7	4	20	The second layer is that (part of the body) which is above the legs and below the waist; and the filling of soil is flesh: thus, in covering the second layer with a filling of soil, he covers that (part) of his body with flesh.  after laying down bricks, and bricks mean bone: he thus covers the bone with flesh. He places them on a filling of soil, and covers them with a filling of soil: he thus covers that (part) of his body on both sides with flesh; whence that part of his body, being on both sides covered with flesh, is not visible.
7	4	21	The third layer is the waist itself; the fourth layer is that (part of the body) which is above the waist and below the neck; the fifth layer is the neck, the sixth layer is the head, and the seventh layer is the vital airs. This he lays down as the last (or highest): he thus makes the vital airs the highest of all this (universe), and hence the vital airs are the highest thing of all this (universe). He places it on a filling of soil; and the filling of soil means flesh; he thus covers (the channels of) the vital airs with flesh. He does not cover it above, whence these (channels of the) vital airs are not closed up above.
