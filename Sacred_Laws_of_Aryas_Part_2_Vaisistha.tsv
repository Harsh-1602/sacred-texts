Chapter_no	Text_no	Hymn
1	1	Now, therefore, the desire to know the sacred law for their welfare (should arise) in (initiated) men.
1	2	He who knows and follows the (sacred law is called) a righteous man.
1	3	He becomes most worthy of praise in this world and after death gains heaven.
1	4	The sacred law has been settled by the revealed texts and by the tradition (of the sages).
1	5	On failure of (rules given in) these (two sources) the practice of the Sishtas (has) authority.
1	6	But he whose heart is free from desire (is called) a Sishta.
1	7	(Acts sanctioned by) the sacred law (are those) for which no (worldly) cause is perceptible.
1	8	The country of the Âryas (Âryâvarta) lies to the east of the region where (the river Sarasvatî) disappears, to the west of the Black-forest, to the north of the Pâripâtra (mountains), to the south of the Himâlaya.
1	9	(According to others it lies to the south of the Himâlaya) and to the north of the Vindhya range (being limited east and west by the two oceans).
1	10	Acts productive of spiritual merit, and customs which (are approved of) in that country, must be everywhere acknowledged (as authoritative);
1	11	But not different ones, (i.e. those) of (countries where) laws opposed (to those of Âryâvarta prevail).
1	12	Some (declare the country of the Âryas to be situated) between the (rivers) Gaṅgâ and Yamunâ.
1	13	Others (state as) an alternative, that spiritual pre-eminence (is found) as far as the black antelope grazes.
1	14	Now the Bhâllavins quote also (the following) verse in the Nidâna:
1	15	'In the west the boundary-river, in the east the region where the sun rises,--as far as the black antelope wanders (between these two limits), so far spiritual pre-eminence (is found).
1	16	'Those religious acts which men, deeply versed in the knowledge of the three Vedas and acquainted with the sacred law, declare to be lawful, (are efficient) for purifying oneself and others.'
1	17	Manu has declared that the (peculiar) laws of countries, castes, and families (may be followed) in the absence of (rules of) the revealed texts.
1	18	Sinful men are, he who sleeps at sunrise or at sunset, he who has deformed nails or black teeth, he whose younger brother was married first, he who married before his elder brother, the husband of a younger sister married before the elder, the husband of an elder sister whose younger sister was married first, he who extinguishes the sacred fires, (and) he who forgets the Veda through neglect of the daily recitation.
1	19	They state that there are five mortal sins. (mahâpâtaka),
1	20	(Viz. violating) a Guru's bed, drinking (the spirituous liquor called) surâ, slaying a learned Brâhmana, stealing the gold of a Brâhmana, and associating with outcasts,
1	21	Either by (entering into) spiritual or matrimonial (connexion with them).
1	22	Now they quote also (the following verse): 'He who during a year associates with an outcast becomes (likewise) an outcast; not by sacrificing for him, by teaching him or by (forming) a matrimonial (alliance with him), but by using the same carriage or seat.'
1	23	A minor offence causing loss of caste (ûpapâtaka, is committed by him) who (after beginning an Agnihotra sacrifice) forsakes the sacred fires, and by him who offends a Guru, by an atheist, by him who takes his livelihood from atheists, and by him who sells the Soma (plant).
1	24	Three wives (are permitted) to a Brâhmana according to the order of the castes, two to a Kshatriya, one to a Vaisya and to a Sûdra.
1	25	Some declare (that twice-born men may marry) even a female of the Sûdra caste, like those (other wives), without (the recitation of) Vedic texts.
1	26	Let him not act thus.
1	27	For in consequence of such (a marriage) the degradation of the family certainly ensues, and after death the loss of heaven.
1	28	There are six marriage-rites,
1	29	(Viz.) that of Brahman (brâhma), that of the gods (daiva), that of the Rishis (ârsha), that of the Gandharvas (gândharva), that of the Kshatriyas (kshâtra), and that of men (mânusha).
1	30	If the father, pouring out a libation of water, gives his (daughter) to a suitor, that (is called) the Brahma-rite
1	31	If (the father) gives his daughter, decking her with ornaments, to an officiating priest, whilst a sacrifice is being performed, that is called the Daiva-rite.
1	32	And (if the father gives his daughter) for a cow and a bull, (that is called) the Ârsha-rite.
1	33	If a lover takes a loving female of equal caste, that (is called) the Gândharva-rite.
1	34	If they forcibly abduct (a damsel), destroying (her relatives) by strength (of arms), that (is called) the Kshâtra-rite.
1	35	If, after making a bargain (with the father, a suitor) marries (a damsel) purchased for money, that (is called) the Mânusha-rite.
1	36	The purchase (of a wife) is mentioned in the following passage of the Veda, 'Therefore one hundred (cows) besides a chariot should be given to the father of the bride.'
1	37	(It is stated) in (the following passage of) the Kâturmâsyas, 'She (forsooth) who has been bought by her husband (commits sin, as) afterwards she unites herself with strangers.'
1	38	Now they quote also (the following verse): 'Lost learning comes back; when the family is lost all is lost. Even a horse becomes estimable on account of its pedigree; therefore men marry wives descended from an (unblemished) family.
1	39	The three (lower) castes shall live according to the teaching of the Brâhmana.
1	40	The Brâhmana shall declare their duties,
1	41	And the king shall govern them accordingly.
1	42	But a king who rules in accordance with the sacred law, may take the sixth part of the wealth (of his subjects),
1	43	Except from Brâhmanas.
1	44	It has been declared in the Veda, 'But he obtains the sixth part of (the merit which Brâhmanas gain by) sacrifices and charitable works.'
1	45	(It is further stated in the Veda), 'The Brâhmana makes the Veda rich; the Brâhmana saves from misfortune; therefore the Brâhmana shall not be made a source of subsistence. Soma is his king.'
1	46	Further (another passage says), 'After death bliss (awaits the king who does not oppress Brâhmanas).'
2	1	There are four castes (varna), Brâhmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, and Sûdras.
2	2	Three castes, Brâhmanas, Kshatriyas, and Vaisyas, (are called) twice-born.
2	3	Their first birth is from their mother; the second from the investiture with the sacred girdle. In that (second birth) the Sâvitrî is the mother, but the teacher is said to be the father.
2	4	They call the teacher father, because he gives instruction in the Veda.
2	5	They quote also (the following passage from the Veda) to the same (effect): 'Of two kinds, forsooth, is the virile energy of a man learned in the Vedas, that which (resides) above the navel and the other which below (the navel) descends down-wards. Through that which (resides) above the navel, his offspring is produced, when he initiates Brâhmanas, when he teaches them, when he causes them to offer oblations, when he makes them holy. By that which resides below the navel the children of his body are produced. Therefore they never say, to a Srotriya, who teaches the Veda, "Thud art destitute of offspring."'
2	6	Hârîta also quotes (the following verse): 'No religious rite can be performed by a (child) before he has been girt with the sacred girdle, since he is on a level with a Sûdra before his (new) birth from the Veda.'
2	7	(The above prohibition refers to all rites) except those connected with libations of water, (the exclamation) Svadhâ, and the manes.
2	8	Sacred learning approached a Brâhmana (and said to him), 'Preserve me, I am thy treasure, reveal me not to a scorner, nor to a wicked man, nor to one of uncontrolled passions: so (preserved) I shall become strong.'
2	9	'Reveal me, O Brâhmana, as to the keeper of thy treasure, to him whom thou shalt know to be pure, attentive, intelligent, and chaste, who will not offend thee nor revile thee.'
2	10	'(That man) who fills his ears with truth, who frees him from pain and confers immortality upon him, (the pupil) shall consider as his father and mother; him he must never grieve nor revile.'
2	11	'As those Brâhmanas who, after receiving instruction, do not honour their teacher by their speech, in their hearts or by their acts, will not be profitable to their teacher, even so that sacred learning (which they acquired) will not profit them.'
2	12	'As fire consumes dry grass, even so the Veda, asked for, (but) not honoured, (destroys the enquirer). Let him not proclaim the Veda to that man, who does not show him honour according to his ability.'
2	13	The (lawful) occupations of a Brâhmana are six,
2	14	Studying the Veda, teaching, sacrificing for himself, sacrificing for. others, giving alms, and accepting gifts.
2	15	(The lawful occupations) of a Kshatriya are three,
2	16	Studying, sacrificing for himself, and bestowing gifts;
2	17	And his peculiar duty is to protect the people with his weapons; let him gain his livelihood thereby.
2	18	(The lawful occupations) of a Vaisya are the same ,
2	19	Besides, agriculture, trading, tending cattle, and lending money at interest,
2	20	To serve those (superior castes) has been fixed as the means of livelihood for a Sûdra.
2	21	(Men of) all (castes) may wear their hair arranged according to the customs fixed (for their family), or allow it to hang down excepting the lock on the crown of the head.
2	22	Those who are unable to live by their own lawful occupation may adopt (that of) the next inferior (caste),
2	23	But never (that of a) higher (caste).
2	24	(A Brâhmana and a Kshatriya) who have re-sorted to a Vaisya's mode of living, and maintain themselves by trade (shall not sell) stones, salt, hempen (cloth), silk, linen (cloth), and skins,
2	25	Nor any kind of dyed cloth,
2	26	Nor prepared food, flowers, fruit, roots, per-fumes, substances (used for) flavouring (food); nor water, the juice extracted from plants; nor Soma, weapons, poison; nor flesh, nor milk, nor preparations from it, iron, tin, lac, and lead,
2	27	Now they quote also (the following verse): 'By (selling) flesh, lac, and salt a Brâhmana at once becomes an outcast; by selling milk he. becomes (equal to) a Sûdra after three days.'
2	28	Among tame animals those with uncloven hoofs, and those that have an abundance of hair, (must not be sold), nor any wild animals, (nor) birds, nor beasts that have tusks (or fangs).
2	29	Among the various kinds of grain they mention sesamum (as forbidden).
2	30	Now they quote also (the following verse): If he applies sesamum to any other purpose, but food, anointing, and charitable gifts, he will be born again as a worm and, together with his ancestors, be plunged into his own ordure.'
2	31	Or, at pleasure, they may sell (sesamum), if they themselves have produced it by tillage.
2	32	For that purpose he shall plough before breakfast with two bulls whose noses have not been pierced.
2	33	(If he ploughs) in the hot season, he shall water (his beasts even in the morning).
2	34	The plough is attended by strong males, provided with a useful share and with a handle (to be held) by the drinker of Soma; that raises (for him) a cow, a sheep, a stout damsel, and a swift horse for the chariot.
2	35	The plough is attended by strong males, i.e. is attended by strong men and bullocks, provided with a useful share--for its share is useful (because) with the share it raises, i.e. pierces deep--and provided with a handle for the drinker of Soma,--for Soma reaches him,--possessing a handle for him. That raises a cow, a sheep, goats, horses, mules, donkeys and camels, and a stout damsel, i.e. a beautiful, useful maiden in the flower of her youth.
2	36	For how could the plough raise (anything for him) if he did not sell grain?
2	37	Substances used for flavouring may be bartered for (other) substances of the same kind, be it for one more valuable or for one worth less.
2	38	But salt must never (be exchanged) for (other) substances-used for flavouring (food).
2	39	It is permitted to barter sesamum, rice, cooked food, learning, and slaves (each for its own kind and the one for the other).
2	40	A Brâhmana and a Kshatriya shall not lend (anything at interest acting like) usurers.
2	41	Now they quote also (the following verses): 'He who acquiring property cheap, gives it for a high price, is called a usurer and blamed among those who recite the Veda.'
2	42	'(Brahman) weighed in the scales the crime of killing a learned Brâhmana against (the crime of) usury; the slayer of the Brâhmana remained at the top, the usurer sank downwards.'
2	43	Or, at pleasure, they may lend to a person who entirely neglects his sacred duties, and is exceedingly wicked,
2	44	Gold (taking) double (its value on repayment, and) grain trebling (the original price).
2	45	(The case of) flavouring substances has been explained by (the rule regarding) grain,
2	46	As well as (the case of) flowers, roots, and fruit.
2	47	(They may lend) what is sold by weight, (taking) eight times (the original value on repayment).
2	48	Now they quote also (the following verses): 'Two in the hundred, three and four and five, as has teen declared in the Smriti, he may take as interest by the month according to the order of the castes.'
2	49	'But the king's death shall stop the interest on money (lent);'
2	50	'And after the coronation of (a new) king the capital grows again.'
2	51	'Hear the interest for a money-lender declared by the words of Vasishtha, five mash's for twenty (kârshâpanas may be taken every month); thus the law is not violated.'
3	1	(Brâhmanas) who neither study nor teach the Veda nor keep sacred fires become equal to Sûdras;
3	2	And they quote a verse of Manu on this (subject), 'A twice-born man, who not having studied the Veda applies himself to other (and worldly study), soon falls, even while living, to the condition of a Sûdra, and his descendants after him.'
3	3	'(A twice-born man) who does not know the [paragraph continues] Veda (can)not be (called) a Brâhmana, nor he who lives by trade, nor he who (lives as) an actor, nor he who obeys a Sûdra's commands, nor (he who like) a thief (takes the property of others), nor he who makes his living by the practice of medicine.'
3	4	'The king shall punish that village where Brâhmanas, unobservant of their sacred duties and ignorant of the Veda, subsist by begging; for it feeds robbers.'
3	5	'Many thousands (of Brâhmanas) cannot form a (legal) assembly (for declaring the sacred law), if they have not fulfilled their sacred duties, are unacquainted with the Veda, and subsist only by the name of their caste.'
3	6	'That sin which dunces, perplexed by ignorance and unacquainted with the sacred law, declare (to be duty) shall fall, increased a hundredfold, on those who propound it.'
3	7	'What four or (even) three (Brâhmanas) who have completely studied the Vedas proclaim, that must be distinctly recognised as the sacred law, not (the decision) of a thousand fools.'
3	8	'Offerings to the gods and to the manes must always be given to a Srotriya alone. For giftsbestowed on a man unacquainted with the Veda, reach neither the ancestors nor the gods.'
3	9	'If a fool lives even in one's house and a (Brâhmana) deeply learned in the Veda lives at a great distance, the learned man shall receive the gift. The sin of neglecting (a Brâhmana is not incurred) in (the case of) a fool.'
3	10	'The offence of neglecting a Brâhmana cannot be committed against a twice-born man who is ignorant of the Veda. For (in offering sacrifices) one does not pass by a brilliant fire and throw the oblations into ashes.'
3	11	An elephant made of wood, an antelope made of leather, and a Brâhmana ignorant of the Veda, those three have nothing but the name (of their kind).
3	12	'Those kingdoms, where ignorant men eat the food of the learned, will be visited by drought; or (some other) great evil will befall (them).'
3	13	If anybody finds treasure (the owner of) which is not known, the king shall take it, giving one sixth to the finder.
3	14	If a Brâhmana who follows the six (lawful) occupations, finds it, the king shall not take it.
3	15	They declare that the slayer commits no crime by killing an assassin.
3	16	Now they quote also (the following verses): 'An incendiary, likewise a poisoner, one who holds a weapon in his hand (ready to kill), a robber, he who takes away land, and he who abducts (another man's) wife, these six are called assassins (âtatâyin).'
3	17	'He may slay an assassin who comes with the intention of slaying, even though he knows the whole Veda together with the Upanishads; by that (act) he (does) not (incur the guilt of) the slayer of a Brâhmana.'
3	18	'He who slays an assassin learned in the Veda and belonging to a noble family, does not incur by that act the guilt of the murderer of a learned Brâhmana.; (in) that (case) fury recoils upon fury.'
3	19	Persons who sanctify the company are, a Trinâkiketa, one who keeps five fires, a Trisuparna, one who (knows the texts required for) the four sacrifices (called Asvamedha, Purushamedha, Sarvamedha, and Pitrimedha), one who knows the Vâgasaneyi-sâkhâ of the White Yagur-veda, one who knows the six Aṅgas, the son of a female married according to the Brâhma-rite, one who knows the first part of the Sâma-veda Samhitâ, one who sings the Gyeshthasâman, one who knows the Samhitâ and the Brâhmana, one who studies (the treatises on) the sacred law, one whose ancestors to the ninth degree, both on the mother's and on the father's side, are distinctly known to have been Srotriyas, and learned men and Snâtakas.
3	20	(Four students of) the four Vedas, one who knows the Mîmâmsâ, one who knows the Aṅgas, a teacher of the sacred law, and three eminent men who are in three (different) orders, (compose) a (legal) assembly consisting at least of ten (members).
3	21	He who initiates (a pupil) and teaches him the whole Veda is called the teacher (âkârya).
3	22	But he who (teaches) a portion (of the Veda only is called) the sub-teacher (upâdhyâya);
3	23	So is he who (teaches) the Aṅgas of the Veda.
3	24	A Brâhmana and a Vaisya may take up arms in self-defence, and in (order to prevent) a confusion of the castes.
3	25	But that (trade of arms) is the constant (duty) of a Kshatriya, because he is appointed to protect (the people).
3	26	Having washed his feet and his hands up to the wrist, and sitting with his face turned towards the east or towards the north, he shall thrice sip water out of the Tîrtha sacred to Brahman, (i.e.) the part of the hand above the root of the thumb, without uttering any sound;
3	27	He shall twice wipe (his mouth with the root of the thumb);.
3	28	He shall touch the cavities (of the head) with water;
3	29	He shall pour water on his head and on the left hand;
3	30	He shall not sip water while walking, standing., lying down or bending forward.
3	31	A Brâhmana (becomes pure) by (sipping) water, free from bubbles and foam, that reaches his heart,
3	32	But a Kshatriya by (sipping water) that reaches his throat,
3	33	A Vaisya by (sipping water) that wets his palate,
3	34	A woman and a Sûdra by merely touching water (with the lips).
3	35	Water (for sipping may) even (be taken) out of a hole in the ground, if it is fit to slake the thirst of cows.
3	36	(He shall not purify himself with water) which has been defiled with colours, perfumes, or flavouring substances, nor with such as is collected in unclean places.
3	37	Drops (of saliva) falling from the mouth, which do not touch a limb of the body, do not make (a man) impure.
3	38	If, after having sipped water, he sleeps, eats, sneezes, drinks, weeps or bathes, or puts on a dress, he must again sip water,
3	39	Likewise, if he touches (that part of) the lips on which no hair grows.
3	40	No defilement is caused by the hair of the moustache (entering the mouth).
3	41	If (remnants of food) adhere to the teeth, (they are pure) like the teeth, and he is purified by swallowing those which (become detached) in the mouth.
3	42	He is not defiled by the drops which fall on his feet, while somebody gives to others water for sipping; they are stated to be equally (clean) as the ground.
3	43	If, while occupied with eatables, he touches any impure substance, then he shall place that thing (which he holds in his hand) on the ground, sip water and afterwards again use it.
3	44	Let him sprinkle with water all objects (the purity of) which may be doubtful.
3	45	'Both wild animals killed by dogs, and fruit thrown by birds (from the tree), what has been spoilt by children, and what has been handled by women,'
3	46	'A vendible commodity tendered for sale and what is not dirtied by gnats and flies that have settled on it,'
3	47	'Likewise water collected on the ground that quenches the thirst of cows,--enumerating all these things, the Lord of created beings has declared them to be pure.'
3	48	Anything defiled by unclean (substances) becomes pure when the stains and the smell have been removed by water and earth.
3	49	(Objects) made of metal must be scoured with ashes, those made of clay should be thoroughly heated by fire, those made of wood should be planed, and (cloth) made of thread should be washed.
3	50	Stones and gems (should be treated) like objects made of metal,
3	51	Conch-shells and pearl-shells like gems,
3	52	(Objects made of) bone like wood,
3	53	Ropes, chips (of bamboo), and leather become pure (if treated) like clothes,
3	54	(Objects) made of fruits, (if rubbed) with (a brush of) cow hair,
3	55	Linen cloth, (if smeared) with a paste of yellow mustard (and washed afterwards with water).
3	56	But land becomes pure, according to the degree of defilement, by sweeping (the defiled spot), by smearing it with cowdung, by scraping it, by sprinkling (water) or by heaping (pure earth) on (it).
3	57	Now they quote also (the following verses): 'Land is purified by these four methods, by digging, burning, scraping, being trodden on by cows, and fifthly by being smeared with cowdung.'
3	58	'A woman is purified by her monthly discharge, a river by its current, brass by (being scoured with) ashes, and an earthen pot by another burning.'
3	59	'But an earthen vessel which has been defiled by spirituous liquor, urine, ordure, phlegm, pus, tears, or blood cannot be purified even by another burning.'
3	60	'The body is purified by water, the internal organ by truth, the soul by sacred learning and austerities, and the understanding by knowledge.'
3	61	Gold is purified by water alone,
3	62	Likewise silver,
3	63	Copper is cleansed by acids.
3	64	The Tîrtha sacred to the Gods lies at the root of the little finger,
3	65	That sacred to the Rishis in the middle of the fingers,
3	66	That sacred to Men at the tips of the fingers,
3	67	That sacred to Agni (fire) in the middle of the hand,
3	68	That sacred to the Manes between the forefinger and the thumb.
3	69	He shall honour (his food at) the evening and morning meals (saying), 'It pleases me,'
3	70	At meals in honour of the Manes (saying), I have dined well,'
3	71	At (a dinner given on the occasion of) rites procuring prosperity (saying), 'It is perfect:
4	1	The four castes are distinguished by their origin and by particular sacraments.
4	2	There is also the following passage of the Veda, 'The Brâhmana was his mouth, the Kshatriya formed his arms, the Vaisya his thighs; the Sûdra was born from his feet.'
4	3	It has been declared in (the following passageof) the Veda that (a Sûdra) shall not receive the sacraments, 'He created the Brâhmana with the Gâyatrî (metre), the Kshatriya with the Trishtubh, the Vaisya with the Gagatî, the Sûdra without any metre.'
4	4	Truthfulness, suppression of anger, liberality, abstention from injuring living beings, and the procreation of offspring (are duties common to) all (castes).
4	5	The Mânava (Sûtra states), 'Only when he worships the manes and the gods, or honours guests, he may certainly do injury to animals.'
4	6	'On offering a Madhuparka (to a guest), at a sacrifice, and at the rites in honour of the manes, but on these occasions only may an animal be slain; that (rule) Manu proclaimed.'
4	7	'Meat can never be obtained without injuring living beings, and to injure living beings does not procure heavenly bliss; therefore the (sages declare) the slaughter (of beasts) at a sacrifice not to be slaughter (in the ordinary sense of the word).'
4	8	'Now he may also cook a full-grown ox or a full-grown he-goat for a Brâhmana or Kshatriya guest; in this manner they offer hospitality to such (a man).'
4	9	Libations of water (must be poured out) for all (deceased relatives) who completed the second year and (their death causes) impurity.
4	10	Some declare that (this rule applies also to children) that died after teething.
4	11	After having burnt the body (of the deceased, the relatives) enter the water without looking at (the place of cremation),
4	12	Facing the south, they shall pour out water with both hands on (those days of the period of impurity) which are marked by odd numbers.
4	13	The south, forsooth, is the region sacred to the manes.
4	14	After they have gone home, they shall sit during three days on mats, fasting.
4	15	If they are unable (to fast so long), they shall subsist on food bought in the market or given unasked.
4	16	It is ordered that impurity caused by a death shall last ten days in the case of Sapinda relations.
4	17	It has been declared in the Veda that Sapinda relationship extends to the seventh person (in the ascending or descending line).
4	18	It has been declared in the Veda that for married females it extends to the third person (in the ascending or descending line).
4	19	Others (than the blood-relations) shall perform (the obsequies) of married females,
4	20	(The rule regarding impurity) should be exactly the same on the birth of a child for those men who desire complete purity,
4	21	Or for the mother and the father (of the child alone); some (declare that it applies) to the mother (only), because she is the immediate cause of that (event).
4	22	Now they quote also (the following verse): On the birth (of a child) the male does not become impure if he does not touch (the female); on that (occasion) the menstrual excretion must be known to be impure, and that is not found in males.'
4	23	If during (a period of impurity) another (death or birth) happens, (the relatives) shall be pure after (the expiration of) the remainder of that (first period);
4	24	(But) if one night (and day only of the first period of impurity) remain, (they shall be pure) after two (days and nights);
4	25	(If the second death or birth happens) on the morning (of the day on which the first period of impurity expires, they shall be purified) after three (days and nights).
4	26	A Brâhmana is freed from impurity (caused by a death or a birth) after ten days,
4	27	A Kshatriya after fifteen days,
4	28	A Vaisya after twenty days,
4	29	A Sûdra after a month.
4	30	Now they quote also (the following verses): 'But (a twice-born man) who has eaten (the food) of a Sûdra during impurity caused by a death or abirth, will suffer dreadful (punishment in) hell and be born again in the womb of an animal.'
4	31	'A twice-born man who eats by appointment in the house of a stranger whose ten days of impurity, caused by a death, have not expired, after death will become a worm and feed on the ordure of that (man who fed him).'
4	32	It has been declared in the Veda, '(Such a sinner) becomes pure by reciting the Samhitâ of the Veda for twelve months or for twelve half-months while fasting.'
4	33	On the death of a child of less than two years or on a miscarriage, the impurity of the Sapindas lasts three (days and) nights.
4	34	Gautama (declares that on the former occasion they become) pure at once.
4	35	If (a person) dies in a foreign country and (his Sapindas) hear (of his death) after ten days (or a longer period), the impurity lasts for one (day and) night.
4	36	Gautama (declares that) if a person who has kindled the sacred fire dies on a journey, (his Sapindas shall) again celebrate his obsequies, (burning a dummy made of leaves or straw), and remain impure (during ten days) as if (they had actually buried) his corpse.
4	37	When he has touched a sacrificial post, a pyre, a burial-ground, a menstruating or a lately confined woman, impure men or (Kândâlas and so forth), he shall bathe, submerging both his body and his head.
5	1	A woman is not independent, the males are her masters. It has been declared in the Veda, 'A female who neither goes naked nor is temporarily unclean is paradise.'
5	2	Now they quote also (the following verse): 'Their fathers protect them in childhood, their husbands protect them in youth, and their sons protect them in age; a woman is never fit for independence.'
5	3	The penance (to be performed) by a (wife) for being unfaithful to her husband has been declared in the (section on) secret penances.
5	4	For month by month the menstrual excretion takes away her sins.
5	5	A woman in her courses is impure during three (days and) nights.
5	6	(During that period) she shall not apply collyrium to her eyes, nor anoint (her body), nor bathe in water; she shall sleep on the ground; she shall not sleep in the day-time, nor touch the fire, nor make a rope, nor clean her teeth, nor eat meat, nor look at the planets, nor smile, nor busy herself with (house-hold affairs), nor run; she shall drink out of a large vessel, or out of her joined hands, or out of a copper vessel.
5	7	For it has been declared in the Veda, 'When Indra had slain (Vritra) the three-headed son of Tvashtri, he was seized by Sin, and he considered himself to be tainted with exceedingly great guilt. All beings cried out against him (saying to him), [paragraph continues] 'O thou slayer of a learned Brâhmana! O thou slayer of a learned Brâhmana!' He ran to the women for protection (and said to them), 'Take upon yourselves the third part of this my guilt (caused by) the murder of a learned Brâhmana.' They answered, ''What shall we have (for doing thy wish)?' He replied, 'Choose a boon.' They said, 'Let us obtain offspring (if our husbands approach us) during the proper season, at pleasure let us dwell (with our husbands until (our children) are born.' He answered, 'So be it.' (Then) they took upon themselves (the third part of his guilt). That guilt of Brâhmana-murder appears every month as the menstrual flow. Therefore let him not eat the food of a woman in her courses; (for) such a one has put on the shape of the guilt of Brâhmana-murder.
5	8	(Those who recite the Veda) proclaim the following (rule): 'Collyrium and ointment must not be accepted from her; for that is the food of women. Therefore they feel a loathing for her (while she is) in that (condition, saying), "She shall not approach."'
5	9	'Those (Brâhmanas in) whose (houses) menstruating women sit, those who keep no sacred fire, and those in whose family there is no Srotriya; all these are equal to Sûdras.'
6	1	(To live according to) the rule of conduct is doubtlessly the highest duty of all men. He whose soul is defiled by vile conduct perishes in this world and in the next.
6	2	Neither austerities, nor (the study of) the Veda, nor (the performance of) the Agnihotra, nor lavish liberality can ever save him whose conduct is vile and who has strayed from this (path of duty).
6	3	The Vedas do not purify him who is deficient in good conduct, though he may have learnt them all together with the six Aṅgas; the sacred texts depart from such a man at death, even as birds, when full-fledged, leave their nest.
6	4	As the beauty of a wife causes no joy to a blind man, even so all the four Vedas together with the six Aṅgas and sacrifices give no happiness to him who is deficient in good conduct.
6	5	The sacred texts do not save from sin the deceitful man who behaves deceitfully. But that Veda, two syllables of which are studied in the right manner, purifies, just as the clouds (give beneficent rain) in the month of Isha.
6	6	A man of bad conduct is blamed among men, evils befal him constantly, he is afflicted with disease and short-lived.
6	7	Through good conduct man gains spiritual merit, through good conduct he gains wealth, through good conduct he obtains beauty, good conduct obviates the effect of evil marks.
6	8	A man who follows the rule of conduct established among the virtuous, who has faith and is free from envy, lives a hundred years, though he be destitute of all auspicious marks.
6	9	But a man who knows the sacred law shall perform in secret all acts connected with eating, the natural evacuations and dalliance with (his wife); business to be accomplished by speech or intellect, likewise austerities, wealth, and age, must be most carefully concealed.
6	10	And a man shall void both urine and fæces, facing the north, in the day-time, but at night he shall do it turning towards the south; for (if he acts) thus, his life will not be injured.
6	11	: The intellect of that man perishes who voids urine against a fire, the sun, a cow, a Brâhmana, the moon, water, and the morning or evening twilights.
6	12	Let him not void urine in a river, nor on a path, nor on ashes, nor on cowdung, nor on a ploughed field, nor on one which has been sown, nor on a grass-plot, nor in the shade (of trees) that afford protection (to travellers).
6	13	Standing in the shade (of houses, clouds, and so forth), when it is quite dark, and when he fears for his life, a Brâhmana may void urine, by day and by night, in any position he pleases.
6	14	(Afterwards) he shall perform the necessary (purification) with water fetched for the purpose (from a tank or river, and with earth).
6	15	For a bath water not fetched for the purpose (may also be used).
6	16	(For the purpose of purification) a Brâhmanashall take earth that is mixed with gravel, from the bank (of a river).
6	17	Five kinds of earth must not be used, viz. such as is covered by water, such as lies in a temple, on an ant-hill, on a hillock thrown up by rats, and that which has been left by one who cleaned himself.
6	18	The organ (must be cleaned by) one (application of) earth, the (right) hand by three, but both (feet) by two, the anus by five, the one (i.e. the left hand) by ten, and both (hands and feet) by seven (applications of earth).
6	19	Such is the purification ordained for house-holders; it is double for students, treble for hermits, but quadruple for ascetics.
6	20	Eight mouthfuls are the meal of an ascetic, sixteen that of a hermit, but thirty-two that of a householder, and an unlimited quantity that of a student.
6	21	An Agnihotrin, a draught-ox, and a student, those three can do their work only if they eat (well); without eating (much), they cannot do it.
6	22	(The above rule regarding limited allowances of food holds good) in the case of penances, of self-imposed restraint, of sacrifices, of the recitation of the Veda, and of (the performance of other) sacred duties.
6	23	The qualities by which a (true) Brâhmana may be recognised are, the concentration of the mind, austerities, the subjugation of the senses, liberality, truthfulness, purity, sacred learning, compassion, worldly learning, intelligence, and the belief (in the existence of the deity and of a future life).
6	24	One may know that bearing grudges, envy, speaking untruths, speaking evil of Brâhmanas, backbiting, and cruelty are the characteristics of a Sûdra.
6	25	Those Brâhmanas can save (from evil) who are free from passion, and patient of austerities, whose ears have been filled with the texts of the Veda, who have subdued the organs of sensation and action, who have ceased to injure animated beings, and who close their hands when gifts are offered.
6	26	Some become worthy receptacles of gifts through sacred learning, and some through the practice of austerities. But that Brâhmana whose stomach does not contain the food of a Sûdra, is even the worthiest receptacle of all.
6	27	if a Brâhmana dies with the food of a Sûdra in his stomach, he will become a village pig (in his next life) or be born, in the family of that (Sûdra).
6	28	For though a (Brâhmana) whose body is nourished by the essence of a Sûdra's food maydaily recite the Veda, though he may offer (an Agnihotra) or mutter (prayers, nevertheless) he will not find the path that leads upwards.
6	29	But if, after eating the food of a Sûdra, he has conjugal intercourse, his sons will belong to the giver of the food, and he shall not ascend to heaven.
6	30	They declare that he is worthy to receive gifts, who (daily) rises to recite the Veda, who is of good family, and perfectly free from, passion, who constantly offers. sacrifices in the three sacred fires, who fears sin, and knows much, who is beloved among the females (of his family), who is righteous, protects cows, and reduces himself by austerities.
6	31	Just as milk, sour milk, clarified butter, and honey poured. into an unburnt earthen vessel, perish, owing to the weakness of the vessel, and neither the vessel nor those liquids (remain),
6	32	Even so a man destitute of sacred learning, who accepts cows or gold, clothes, a horse, land, (or) sesamum, becomes ashes, as (if he were dry) wood.
6	33	He shall not make his joints or his nails crack,
6	34	Nor shall he make a vessel ring with his nails.
6	35	Let him not drink water out of his joined hands.
6	36	Let him not strike the water with his foot or his hand,
6	37	Nor (pour) water into (other) water.
6	38	Let him not gather fruit by throwing brickbats,
6	39	Nor by throwing another fruit at it.
6	40	He shall not become a hypocrite or deceitful.
6	41	Let him not learn a language spoken by barbarians.
6	42	Now they quote' also (the following verses): 'The opinion of the Sishtas is, that a man shall not be uselessly active, neither with his hands and his feet, nor with his eyes, nor with his tongues and his body.'
6	43	'Those Brâhmanas, in whose families the study of the Veda and of its supplements is hereditary, and who are able to adduce proofs perceptible by the senses from the revealed texts, must be known to be Sishtas.'
6	44	'He is a (true) Brâhmana regarding whom no one knows if he be good or bad, if he be ignorant or deeply learned, if he be of good or of bad conduct.'
7	1	There are four orders,
7	2	Viz. (that of) the student, (that of) the house-holder, (that of) the hermit, and (that of) the ascetic.
7	3	A man who has studied one, two, or three Vedas without violating the rules of studentship, may enter any of these (orders), whichsoever he pleases.
7	4	A (professed) student shall serve his teacher until death;
7	5	And in case the teacher dies, he shall serve the sacred fire.
7	6	For it has been declared in the Veda, 'The fire is thy teacher:'
7	7	(A student, whether professed or temporary), shall bridle his tongue;
7	8	He shall eat in the fourth, sixth, or eighth hour of the day.
7	9	He shall go out in order to beg.
7	10	He shall obey his teacher.
7	11	He either (may wear all his hair) tied in a knot or (keep merely) a lock on the crown of his head tied in a knot, (shaving the other parts of the head.)
7	12	If the teacher walks, he shall attend him walking after him; if the teacher is seated, standing; if the teacher lies down, seated.
7	13	He shall study after having been called (by the teacher, and not request the latter to begin the lesson).
7	14	Let him announce (to the teacher) all that he has received (when begging), and eat after permission (has been given to him).
7	15	Let him avoid to sleep on a cot, to clean his teeth, to wash (his body for pleasure), to apply collyrium (to his eyes),. to anoint (his body), and to wear shoes or a parasol.
7	16	(While reciting his prayers) he shall stand in the day-time and sit down at night.
7	17	Let him bathe three times a day.
8	1	(A student who desires to become) a house-holder shall bathe, free from anger and elation, with the permission of his teacher, and take for a wife a young female of his own caste, who does neither belong to the same Gotra nor has the same Pravara, who has not had intercourse (with another man),
8	2	Who is not related within four degrees on the mother's side, nor within six degrees on the father s side.
8	3	Let him kindle the nuptial fire.
8	4	Let him not turn away a guest who comes in the evening.
8	5	(A guest) shall not dwell in his house without receiving food.
8	6	If a Brâhmana who has come for shelter to the house of a (householder) receives no food, on departure he will take with him all the spiritual merit of that (churlish host).
8	7	But a Brâhmana who stays for one night only is called a guest. For (the etymological import of the word) atithi (a guest) is 'he who stays for a short while only.'
8	8	A Brâhmana who lives in the same village (with his host) and a visitor on business, or pleasure (are) not (called guests. But a guest), whether he arrives at the moment (of dinner) or at an inopportune time, must not stay in the house of a (householder) without receiving food.
8	9	(A householder) who has faith, is free from covetousness, and (possesses wealth) sufficient for (performing) the Agnyâdheya-sacrifice, must become an Agnihotrin.
8	10	He (who possesses wealth) sufficient for (the expenses of) a Soma, sacrifice shall not abstain from offering it.
8	11	(A householder) shall be industrious in reciting the Veda, offering sacrifices, begetting children, and (performing his other duties).
8	12	Let him honour visitors (who come) to his house by rising to meet them, by (offering them) seats, by speaking to them kindly and extolling their virtues,
8	13	And all creatures by (giving them) food according to his ability.
8	14	A householder alone performs sacrifices, a householder alone performs austerities, and (therefore) the order of householders is the most distinguished among the four.
8	15	As all rivers, both great and small, find a resting-place in the ocean, even so men of all orders find protection with householders.
8	16	As all creatures exist through the protection afforded by their mothers, even so all mendicants subsist through the protection afforded by householders.
8	17	A Brâhmana who always carries water (in his gourd), who always wears the sacred thread, who daily recites the Veda, who avoids the food of outcasts, who approaches (his wife) in the proper season, and offers sacrifices in accordance with the rules (of the Veda, after death) never falls from Brahman's heaven.
9	1	A hermit shall wear (his hair in) braids, and dress (in garments made of) bark and skins;
9	2	And he shall not enter a village.
9	3	He shall not step on ploughed (land).
9	4	He shall gather wild growing roots and fruit (only).
9	5	He shall remain chaste.
9	6	His heart shall be full of meekness.
9	7	He shall honour guests coming to his hermitage with alms (consisting of) roots and fruit.
9	8	He shall only give, not receive (presents).
9	9	He shall bathe at morn, noon, and eve.
9	10	Kindling a fire according to the (rule of the) Srâmanaka (Sûtra), he shall offer the Agnihotra.
9	11	After (living in this manner during) six months, he shall dwell at the root of a tree, keeping no fire and having no house.
9	12	He (who in this manner) gives (their due) to gods, manes, and men, will attain endless (bliss in) heaven.
10	1	Let an ascetic depart from his house, giving a promise of safety from injury to all animated beings.
10	2	Now they quote also (the following verses): 'That ascetic who wanders about at peace with all creatures, forsooth, has nothing to fear from any living being,'
10	3	'But he who becomes an ascetic and does not promise safety from injury to all beings, destroys the born and the unborn; and (so does an ascetic) who accepts presents.'
10	4	Let him discontinue the performance of all religious ceremonies, but let him never discontinue the recitation of the Veda. By neglecting the Veda he becomes a Sûdra; therefore he shall not neglect it.'
10	5	'(To pronounce) the one syllable (Om) is the best (mode of reciting the) Veda, to suppress the breath is the highest (form of) austerity; (to subsist on) alms is better than fasting; compassion is preferable to liberality.'
10	6	(Let the ascetic) shave (his head); let him have no property and no home.
10	7	Let him beg food at seven houses which he has not selected (beforehand),
10	8	(At the time) when the smoke (of the kitchen-fire) has ceased and the pestle lies motionless.
10	9	Let him wear a single garment,
10	10	Or cover his body with a skin or with grass that has been nibbled at by a cow.
10	11	Let him sleep on the bare ground.
10	12	Let him frequently change his residence,
10	13	(Dwelling) at the extremity of the village, in a temple, or in an empty house, or at the root of a tree.
10	14	Let him (constantly) seek in his heart the knowledge (of the universal soul).
10	15	(An ascetic) who lives constantly in the forest,
10	16	Shall not wander about within sight of the village-cattle.
10	17	'Freedom from future births is certain for him who constantly dwells in the forest, who has subdued his organs of sensation and action, who has renounced all sensual gratification, whose mind is fixed in meditation on the Supreme Spirit, and who is (wholly) indifferent (to pleasure and pain).'
10	18	(Let him) not (wear) any visible mark (of his order), nor (follow) any visible rule of conduct.
10	19	Let him, though not mad, appear like one out of his mind.
10	20	Now they quote also (the following verses): 'There is no salvation for him who is addicted to the pursuit of the science of words, nor for him who rejoices in captivating men, nor for him who is fond of (good) eating and (fine) clothing, nor for him who loves a pleasant dwelling.'
10	21	'Neither by (explaining) prodigies and omens, nor by skill in astrology and palmistry, nor by casuistry and expositions (of the Sâstras), let him ever seek to obtain alms.'
10	22	'Let him not be dejected when he obtains nothing, nor glad when he receives something. Let him only seek as much as will sustain life, without caring for household property.'
10	23	'But he, forsooth, knows (the' road to) salvation who cares neither for a hut, nor for water, nor for clothes, nor for the three Pushkaras' (holy tanks), nor for a house, nor for a seat, nor for food.'
10	24	In the morning and in the evening he may eat as much (food) as he obtains in the house of one Brâhmana, excepting honey and meat,
10	25	And he shall not (eat so much that he is quite) satiated.
10	26	At his option (an ascetic) may (also) dwell in a village.
10	27	Let him not be crooked (in his ways); (let him) not (observe the rules of) impurity on account of deaths (or births); let him not have a house; let him be of concentrated mind.
10	28	Let him not enjoy any object of sensual gratification.
10	29	Let him be (utterly) indifferent, avoiding to do injury or to show kindness to any living being.
10	30	To avoid backbiting, jealousy, pride, self-consciousness, unbelief, dishonesty, self-praise, blaming others, deceit, covetousness, delusion, anger, and envy is considered to be the duty of (men of) all orders.
10	31	A Brâhmana who wears the sacred thread, who holds in his hand a gourd filled with water, who is pure and avoids the food of Sûdras will not fail (to gain) the world of Brahman.
11	1	Six persons are (particularly) worthy to receive the honey-mixture (madhuparka),
11	2	(Viz.) an officiating priest, the bridegroom of one's daughter, a king, a paternal uncle, a Snâtaka, a maternal uncle, as well as (others enumerated elsewhere).
11	3	(A householder) shall offer, both at the morning and the evening (meals, a portion) of the prepared (food) to the Visve Devas in the (sacred) domestic fire.
11	4	Let him give a Bali-offering to the (guardian) deities of the house,
11	5	(Thereafter) let him give a portion, one Pala in weight, to a Srotriya or to a student, (and afterwards an offering) to the manes.
11	6	Next let him feed his guests in due order, the worthiest first,
11	7	(Thereafter) the maidens, the infants, the aged, the half-grown members of his family, and pradâtâs,
11	8	Then the other members of his family.
11	9	(Outside the house) he shall throw (some food) on the ground for the dogs, Kândâlas, outcasts, and crows.
11	10	He may give to a Sûdra either the fragments (of the meal) or (a portion of) fresh (food).
11	11	The master of the house and his wife may eat what remains.
11	12	A fresh meal for which all (the same materials as for the first) are used (may be prepared), if a guest comes after the Vaisvadeva has been offered. For such a (guest) he shall cause to be prepared food (of a) particularly (good quality).
11	13	For it has been declared in the Veda, 'A Brâhmana guest enters the house resembling the Vaisvânara fire. Through., him they obtain rain, and food through rain. Therefore people know that the (hospitable reception of a guest) is a ceremony averting evil.'
11	14	Having fed the (guest), he shall honour him.
11	15	He shall accompany him to the boundary (of the village) or until he receives permission (to return).
11	16	Let him present (funeral offerings) to the manes during the dark half of the month (on any day) after the fourth.
11	17	After issuing an invitation on the day preceding (the Srâddha, he shall feed on that occasion) three ascetics or three virtuous householders, who are Srotriyas, who are not very aged, who do not follow forbidden occupations, and neither (have been his) pupils, nor are (living as) pupils in his house.
11	18	He may also feed pupils who are endowed with good qualities.
11	19	Let him avoid men neglecting their duties, those afflicted with white leprosy, eunuchs, blind men, those who have black teeth, those who suffer from black leprosy, (and) those who have deformed nails.
11	20	Now they quote also (the following verses): 'Now, if a (Brâhmana) versed in the Vedas is afflicted with bodily (defects) which exclude him from the company, Yama declares him to be irreproachable. Such (a man) sanctifies the company.'
11	21	'At a funeral sacrifice the fragments (of the meal) must not be swept away until the end of the day. For streams of nectar flow (from them, and the manes of) those who have received no libations of water drink (them).'
11	22	'But let him not sweep up the fragments (of the meal) before the sun has set. Thence issue rich streams of milk for those who obtain a share with difficulty.'
11	23	'Manu declares that both the remainder (in the vessels) and the fragments (of the meal) certainly are the portion of those members of the family who died before receiving the sacraments.'
11	24	'Let him give the fragments that have fallen on the ground and the portion scattered (on the blades of Kusa grass), which consists of the wipingsand water, as their food, to the manes of those who died without offspring and of those who died young.'
11	25	'The malevolent Asuras seek an opportunity (to snatch away) that food intended for the manes, which is not supported with both hands;'
11	26	'Therefore let him not offer it (to the Brâhmanas) without holding (a spoon) in his hand; or let him stand, holding the dish (with both hands, until) leavings of both kinds (have been produced).'
11	27	'He shall feed two (Brâhmanas) at the offering to the gods, and three at the offering to the manes, or a single man on either occasion; even a very wealthy man shall not be anxious (to entertain) a large company.'
11	28	'A large company destroys these five (advantages), the respectful treatment (of the invited guests, the propriety of) time and place, purity and (the selection of) virtuous Brâhmana (guests); therefore he shall not (invite a large number).'
11	29	'Or he may entertain (at a Srâddha) even a single Brâhmana who has studied the whole Veda, who is distinguished by learning and virtue, and is free from all evil marks (on his body).'
11	30	'(But) how can the oblation to the gods be made if he feeds a single Brâhmana at a funeral sacrifice? Let him take (a portion) of each (kind of) food that has been prepared (and put it) into a vessel;'
11	31	'Let him place it in the sanctuary of a god and afterwards continue (the performance of) the funeral sacrifice. Let him offer that food in the fire or give it (as alms) to a student.'
11	32	'As long as the food continues warm, as long as they eat in silence, as long as the qualities of the food are not declared (by them), so long the manes feast on it.'
11	33	'The qualities of the food must not be declared as long as the (Brâhmanas who represent the) manes are not satiated. Afterwards when they are satisfied, they may say, "Beautiful is the sacrificial food."'
11	34	'But an ascetic who, invited to dine at a sacrifice of the manes or of the gods, rejects meat, shall go to hell for as many years as the slaughtered beast has hairs.'
11	35	'Three (things are held to) sanctify a funeral sacrifice, a daughter's son, the midday, and sesamum grains; and they recommend three (other things) for it, purity, freedom from anger and from precipitation.'
11	36	'The eighth division of the day, during which the sun's (progress in the heavens) becomes slow, one must know to be midday; what is (then) given to the manes lasts (them) for a very long time.'
11	37	'The ancestors of that man who has intercourse with a woman after offering or having dined at a Srâddha, feed during a month from that (day) on his semen.'
11	38	'A child that is born from (intercourse immediately) after offering a Srâddha or partaking of a funeral repast, is unable to acquire sacred learning and becomes short-lived.'
11	39	'The father and the grandfather, likewise the great-grandfather, beset a descendant who is born to them, just as birds (fly to) a rig tree;'
11	40	'(Saying), "He will offer to us funeral repasts with honey and meat, with vegetables, with milk and with messes made of milk, both in the rainy season and under the constellation Maghâh."
11	41	'The ancestors always rejoice at a descendant who lengthens the line, who is zealous in performing funeral sacrifices, and who is rich in (images of the) gods and (virtuous) Brâhmana (guests).'
11	42	'The manes consider him to be their (true) descendant who offers (to them) food at Gayâ, and (by the virtue of that gift) they grant him (blessings), just as husbandmen (produce grain) on well-ploughed (fields).'
11	43	He shall offer (a Srâddha) both on the full moon days of the months Srâvana and Âgrahâyana and on the Anvashtakî.
11	44	There is no restriction as to time, if (particularly suitable) materials and (particularly holy) Brâhmanas are at hand, or (if the sacrificer is) near (a particularly sacred) place.
11	45	A Brâhmana must necessarily kindle the three sacred fires.
11	46	He shall offer (in them) the full and new moon sacrifices, the (half-yearly) Âgraya.a Ishti, the Kâturmâsya-sacrifice, the (half-yearly) sacrifices at which animals are slain, and the (annual) Soma-sacrifices.
11	47	For all this is (particularly) enjoined (in the Veda), and called by way of laudation 'a debt.'
11	48	For it is declared in the Veda, 'A Brâhmana is born, loaded with three debts,' (and further, 'He owes) sacrifices to the gods, a son to the manes, the study of the Veda to the Rishis; therefore he is free from debt who has offered sacrifices, who has begotten a son, and who has lived as a student (with a teacher).'
11	49	Let him (ordinarily) initiate a Brâhmana in the eighth (year) after conception,
11	50	A Kshatriya in the eleventh year after conception,
11	51	A Vaisya in the twelfth year after conception.
11	52	The staff of a Brâhmana (student may) optionally (be made) of Palâsa wood,
11	53	(That) of a Kshatriya optionally of the wood of the Banyan tree,
11	54	(That) of a Vaisya optionally of Udumbara wood.
11	55	(The staff) of a Brâhmana shall (be of such a length as to) reach the hair,
11	56	(That) of a Kshatriya the forehead,
11	57	(That) of a Vaisya the (tip of the) nose.
11	58	The girdle of a Brâhmana shall be made of Muñga grass,
11	59	A bowstring (shall be that) of a Kshatriya,
11	60	(That) of a Vaisya shall be made of hempen threads.
11	61	The upper garment of a Brâhmana (shall be) the skin of a black antelope,
11	62	(That) of a Kshatriya the skin of a spotted deer,
11	63	(That) of a Vaisya a cow-skin or the hide of a he-goat.
11	64	The (lower) garment of a Brâhmana (shall be) white (and) unblemished,
11	65	(That) of a Kshatriya dyed with madder,
11	66	(That) of a Vaisya dyed with turmeric, or made of (raw) silk;
11	67	Or (a dress made of) undyed (cotton) cloth may be worn by (students of) all (castes).
11	68	A Brâhmana shall ask for alms placing (the word) 'Lady' first,
11	69	A Kshatriya placing (the word)' Lady' in the middle,
11	70	A Vaisya placing (the word) Lady' at the end (of the formula).
11	71	The time (for the initiation) of a Brâhmana has not passed until the completion of the sixteenth year,
11	72	(For that) of a Kshatriya until the completion of the twenty-second,
11	73	(For that) of a Vaisya until the completion of the twenty-fourth.
11	74	After that they become 'men whose Sâvitrî has been neglected.'
11	75	Let him not initiate such men, nor teach them, nor sacrifice for them; let them not form matrimonial alliances (with such outcasts).
11	76	A man whose Sâvitrî has not been performed, may undergo the Uddâlaka-penance.
11	77	Let him subsist during two months on barley-gruel, during one month on milk, during half a month on curds of two-milk whey, during eight days on clarified butter, during six days on alms given without asking, (and) during three days on water, and let him fast for one day and one night.
11	78	(Or) he may go to bathe (with the priests) at the end of an Asvamedha (horse-sacrifice).
11	79	Or he may offer a Vrâtya-stoma.
12	1	Now, therefore, the duties of a Snâtaka (will be explained).
12	2	Let him not beg from anybody except from a king and a pupil.
12	3	But let him ask, if pressed by hunger, for some (small gift) only, a cultivated or uncultivated field, a cow, a goat or a sheep, (or) at the last extremity, for gold, grain or food.
12	4	But the injunction (given by those who know the law) is, 'A Snâtaka shall not be faint with hunger.'
12	5	Let him not dwell together with a person whose clothes are foul;
12	6	(Let him not cohabit) with a woman during her courses,
12	7	Nor with an unfit one.
12	8	Let him not be a stay-at-home.
12	9	Let him not step over a stretched rope to which a calf (or cow) is tied.
12	10	Let him not look at the sun when he rises or sets.
12	11	Let him not void excrements or urine in water,
12	12	Nor spit into it.
12	13	Let him ease himself, after wrapping up his head and covering the ground with grass that is not fit to be used at a sacrifice, and turning towards the north in the day-time, turning towards the south at night, sitting with his face towards the north in the twilight.
12	14	Now they quote also (the following verses): 'But Snâtakas shall always wear a lower garment and an upper one, two sacrificial threads, (shall carry) a staff and a vessel filled with water.'
12	15	'It is declared, that (a vessel becomes) pure (if cleaned) with water, or with the hand, or with a stick, or with fire: Therefore he shall clean (his) vessel with water and with his (right) hand.'
12	16	'For Manu, the lord of created beings, calls (this mode of cleaning) encircling it-with fire.'
12	17	He who is perfectly acquainted with (the rules of) purification shall sip water (out of this vessel), after he has relieved the necessities of nature.'
12	18	Let him eat his food facing the east.
12	19	Silently let him swallow the entire mouthful, (introducing it into the mouth) with the four fingers and with the thumb;
12	20	And let him not make a noise (while eating).
12	21	Let him approach his wife in the proper season, except on the Parva days.
12	22	Let him not commit a crime against nature (with her).
12	23	Now they quote also (the following verse): 'The ancestors of a man-who commits an unnatural crime with a wedded wife, feed during that month on his semen. All unnatural intercourse is against the sacred law.'
12	24	It is also declared in the Kâthaka, '(When) the women (asked) Indra, "May even those among us, who are soon to be mothers, (be allowed to) cohabit with their husbands," he granted that wish.'
12	25	Let him not ascend a tree.
12	26	Let him not descend into a well.
12	27	Let him not blow the fire with his mouth.
12	28	Let him not pass between a fire and a Brâhmana,
12	29	Nor between two fires;
12	30	Nor between two Brâhmanas; or (he may do it) after having asked for permission.
12	31	Let him not dine together with his wife. For it is declared in the Vâgasaneyaka, His children will be destitute of manly vigour.'
12	32	Let him not point out (a rainbow calling it) by (its proper) name, 'Indra's bow.'
12	33	Let him call it 'the jewelled bow' (manidhanuh).
12	34	Let him avoid seats, clogs, sticks for cleaning the teeth, (and other implements) made of Palâsa wood.
12	35	Let him not eat (food placed) in his lap.
12	36	Let him not eat (food placed) on a chair.
12	37	Let him carry a staff of bamboo,
12	38	And (wear) two golden earrings.
12	39	Let him not wear any visible wreath excepting a golden one;
12	40	And let him disdain assemblies and crowds.
12	41	Now they quote also (the following verse): 'To deny the authority of the Vedas, to carp at the teaching of the Rishis, to waver with respect to any (matter of duty), that is to destroy one's soul.'
12	42	Let him not go to a sacrifice except if he is chosen (to be an officiating priest. But) if he goes,. he must, on returning home, turn his right hand (towards the place).
12	43	Let him not set out on a journey when the sun stands over the trees.
12	44	Let him not ascend an unsafe boat, or (any unsafe conveyance).
12	45	Let him not cross a river, swimming.
12	46	When he has risen in the last watch (of the night) and has recited (the Veda) he shall not lie down again.
12	47	In the Muhûrta sacred to Pragâpati a Brâhmana shall fulfil some sacred duties.
13	1	Now, therefore, the Upâkarman (or the rite preparatory to the study) of the Veda (must be performed) on the full moon day of the month Srâvana or Praushthapada.
13	2	Having kindled the sacred fire, he offers (therein) unground (rice) grains,
13	3	To the gods, to the Rishis, and to the Khandas.
13	4	Let them begin to study the Vedas, after having made Brâhmanas (invited for the purpose) wish 'welfare' (svasti), and after having fed them with sour milk,
13	5	(And continue the Veda-study) during four months and a half or during five months and a half.
13	6	After (the expiration of) that (period), he may study (the Vedas) during the bright half of each month,
13	7	But the supplementary treatises (Aṅgas) of the Veda at pleasure (both during the bright and the dark halves of each month).
13	8	Interruptions of the (Veda-study shall take place),
13	9	If it thunders during the twilight,
13	10	During (both) the twilights (of each day),
13	11	In towns where a corpse (lies) or Kândâlas (stay).
13	12	At pleasure (he may study seated) in (a place) which has been smeared with cowdung and around which a line has been drawn.
13	13	(Let him not study) near a burial-ground,
13	14	(Nor) lying down,
13	15	Nor when he has eaten or received a gift at a funeral sacrifice;
13	16	And with reference to this (subject) they quote a verse of Manu, 'Be it fruit, or water, or sesamum, or food, or whatever be the (gift) at a Srâddha, let him not, having just accepted it, recite the Veda; for it is declared in the Smriti, that the hand of a Brâhmana is his mouth.'
13	17	(Let him not recite the Veda) while he runs, (nor) while a foul smell and the like (are perceptible, nor) on barren ground,
13	18	(Nor) when he has ascended a tree,
13	19	(Nor) in a boat or in a camp,
13	20	Nor after meals while his hands are moist,
13	21	(Nor) while the sound of a Vâna (is heard),
13	22	(Nor) on the fourteenth day (of each half-month, nor) on the new moon day, (nor) on the eighth day (of each half-month, nor) on an Ashtakâ,
13	23	(Nor) while he stretches his feet out, (nor) while he makes a lap, (nor) while he leans against (something), nor (in any other unbecoming posture),
13	24	(Nor) close to his Gurus,
13	25	(Nor) during that night in which he has had conjugal intercourse,
13	26	(Nor) dressed in that garment which he had on during conjugal intercourse, except if it has been washed,
13	27	(Nor) at the extremity of a village,
13	28	(Nor) after (an attack of) vomiting,
13	29	(Nor) while voiding urine or fæces.
13	30	(Let him not recite) the Rig-veda, the Yagur-veda, and (the Atharva-veda) while the sound of the Sâman melodies (is audible), nor (the Sâman while the other Vedas are being recited).
13	31	(Let him not study) before (his food is) digested,
13	32	(Nor) when a thunderbolt falls,
13	33	(Nor) when an earthquake happens,
13	34	Nor when the sun and the moon are eclipsed.
13	35	When a preternaturally loud sound is heard in the sky, when a mountain falls, (and) when showers of stones, blood or sand (fall from the sky, the Veda must not be read) during the twenty-four hours (immediately succeeding the event).
13	36	If meteors and lightning appear together, (the interruption shall last) three (days and) nights.
13	37	A meteor (alone and) a flash: of lightning (alone cause an interruption lasting) as long as the sun shines (on that or the next day).
13	38	(If rain or other celestial phenomena come) out of season, (the Veda must not be read) during the twenty-four hours (immediately succeeding the event).
13	39	If the teacher has died, (he shall not study the Veda) during three (days and) nights.
13	40	If the teacher's son, a pupil, or a wife (have died, he shall not study) during a day and a night.
13	41	Let him honour an officiating priest, a father-in-law, paternal and maternal uncles, (though they may be) younger than himself, by rising and saluting them,
13	42	Likewise the wives of those persons whose feet must be embraced, and the teacher's (wives)
13	43	And his parents.
13	44	Let him say to one acquainted with (the meaning of) a salute, 'I N. N. ho! (salute thee);'
13	45	But him who does not know it (he shall address with the same formula, omitting his name).
13	46	When a salute is returned, the last vowel (of the noun standing) in the vocative is produced to the length of three moras, and if it is a diphthong (e or o) changeable according to the Sandhi rules, it becomes ây or âv, e.g. bho, bhâv.
13	47	A father who has committed a crime causing loss of caste must be cast off. But a mother does not become an outcast for her son.
13	48	Now they quote also (the following verses): [paragraph continues] 'The teacher (âkârya) is ten times more venerable than a sub-teacher (upâdhyâya), the father a hundred times more than the teacher, and the mother a thousand times more than the father.'
13	49	'A wife, sons, and pupils who are defiled by sinful deeds, must first be reproved, and (if they do not amend, then) be cast off. He who forsakes them in any other way, becomes (himself) an outcast.'
13	50	An officiating priest and a teacher who neglect to teach the recitation of the Veda, or to sacrifice, shall be cast off. If he does not forsake them, he becomes an outcast.
13	51	They declare that the male offspring of outcasts are (also) outcasts, but not the females.
13	52	For a female enters (the family of) a stranger.
13	53	He may marry such a (female) without a dowry.
13	54	'If the teacher's teacher is near, he must be treated like the teacher (himself). The Veda declares that one must behave towards the teacher's son just as towards the teacher.'
13	55	A Brâhmana shall not accept (as gifts) weapons, poison, and spirituous liquor.
13	56	Learning, wealth, age, relationship, and occupation must be honoured.
13	57	(But) each earlier named (quality) is more venerable than (the succeeding ones).
13	58	If he meets aged men, infants, sick men, load-carriers, women, and persons riding in chariots, he must make way (for them, i.e.) for each later (named before those enumerated earlier).
13	59	If a king and a Snâtaka meet, the king must make (way) for the Snâtaka.
13	60	All (must make way) for a bride who is being conveyed (to her husband's house).
13	61	Grass, room (for resting), fire, water, a welcome, and kind words never fail in the houses of good men.
14	1	Now, therefore, we will declare what may be eaten and what may not be eaten.
14	2	Food given by a physician, a hunter, a woman of bad character, a mace-bearer, a thief, an Abhisasta, a eunuch, (or) an outcast must not be eaten,
14	3	(Nor that given) by a miser, one who has performed the initiatory ceremony of a Srauta-sacrifice, a prisoner, a sick person, a seller of the Soma-plant, a carpenter, a washerman, a dealer in spirituous liquor, a spy, a usurer, (or) a cobbler,
14	4	Nor (that given) by a Sûdra,
14	5	Nor (that given) by one who lives by his weapons,
14	6	Nor (that given) by the (kept) paramour of a married woman, or by a husband who allows a paramour (to his wife),
14	7	Nor (that given) by an incendiary,
14	8	Nor (that given) by (a ruler) who does not slay those worthy of capital punishment,
14	9	Nor (food) offered publicly with these words, 'Who is willing to eat?'
14	10	Nor food given by a multitude of givers, or by harlots, and so forth.
14	11	Now they quote also (the following verse): 'The gods do not eat (the offerings) of a man who keeps dogs, nor of him whose (only) wife is of the Sûdra caste, nor of him who lives in subjection to his wife, nor of (a husband) who (permits) a paramour (of his wife to reside) in his house.'
14	12	He may accept (the following presents even) from such (people, viz.) firewood, water, fodder, Kusa grass, parched grain, (food) given without asking, a vehicle, (shelter in) the house, small fish, millet, a garland, perfumes, honey, and meat.
14	13	Now they quote also (the following verse): 'For the sake of a Guru, when he desires to save his wife (and family from starvation), when he wishes to honour the gods or guests, he may accept (presents) from anybody; but let him not satisfy his (own hunger) with such (gifts).'
14	14	Food given by a hunter who uses the bow must not be rejected.
14	15	For it is declared in the Veda, 'At a sacrificial session (sattra), which lasted one thousand years, Agastya went out to hunt. He had sacrificial cakes prepared with the meat of beasts and fowls good (to eat).'
14	16	With reference to this (subject) they quote also some verses proclaimed by Pragâpati, 'Pragâpati (the Lord of created beings) has declared that food freely offered and brought (by the giver himself) may be eaten, though (the giver) be a sinful man, provided the gift has not been asked for beforehand.'
14	17	Food offered by a man who has faith must certainly be eaten, even though (the giver) be a thief, but not that given by (a Brâhmana) who sacrifices for many and who initiates many.'
14	18	'The manes do not eat during fifteen years (the food) of that man who disdains a (freely offered gift), nor does the fire carry his offerings (to the gods).'
14	19	'But alms, though offered without asking, must not be accepted from a physician, from a hunter, from a surgeon or a (very) wicked man, from a eunuch, and from a faithless wife.'
14	20	Fragments of food left by other persons than the teacher must not be eaten,
14	21	Nor remnants of one's own (meal) and food touched by leavings,
14	22	Nor (food) defiled by contact with a garment, hair, or insects.
14	23	But at pleasure he may use (such food) after taking out the hair and the insects, sprinkling it with water, dropping ashes on it, and (after it has been declared) fit for use by the word (of a Brâhmana).
14	24	With reference to this (subject) they quote also some verses proclaimed by Pragâpati, The gods created for Brâhmanas three means of purifying (defiled substances), viz. ignorance (of defilement), sprinkling (them) with water, and commending (them) by word of mouth.'
14	25	Let him not throw away that food which, at a procession with images of the gods, at weddings, and at sacrifices, is touched by crows or dogs.'
14	26	After the (defiled) portion has been removed, the remainder shall be purified, liquids by straining them, but solid food by sprinkling it with water.'
14	27	'What has been touched by the mouth of a cat is even pure.'
14	28	(Cooked food which has become) stale (by being kept), what is naturally bad, what has been placed once only in the dish, what has been cooked more than once, raw (food), and (food) insufficiently cooked (must not be eaten).
14	29	But at pleasure he may use (such food) after pouring over it sour milk or clarified butter.
14	30	With reference to this (subject) they quote also some verses proclaimed by Pragâpati, 'A Brâhmana shall not eat clarified butter or oil which drips from the nails (of the giver). Yama has declared such (food to be) impure; (to eat it is as sinful) as to partake of cow's flesh.'
14	31	'But fatty substances, salt, and condiments proffered with the hand do not benefit the giver, and he who partakes of them will eat sin.'
14	32	'Let him give, therefore, such substances placed on a leaf or on grass, but never with his hands or in an iron vessel.'
14	33	For eating garlic, onions, mushrooms, turnips, Sleshmântaka, exudations from trees, the red sap flowing from incisions (in trees or plants), food pecked at by crows or worried by dogs, or the leavings of a Sûdra, an Atikrikkhra (penance must be performed).
14	34	(Let him not drink) the milk of a cow that is in heat, nor of one whose calf has died,
14	35	Nor that which cows, buffalo-cows, and goats give during the first ten days (after giving birth to young ones),
14	36	Nor water collected at the bottom of a boat.
14	37	Let him avoid wheat-cakes, (fried) grain, porridge, barley-meal, pulse-cakes, oil, rice boiled in milk, and vegetables that have turned sour (by standing),
14	38	Likewise other kinds of (sour) food prepared with milk and barley-flour.
14	39	Among five-toed animals, the porcupine, the hedgehog, the hare, the tortoise, and the iguana may be eaten,
14	40	Among (domestic) animals those having teeth in one jaw only, excepting camels.
14	41	And among fishes, the long-nosed crocodile, the Gavaya, the porpoise, the alligator, and the crab (must not be eaten),
14	42	Nor those which are misshaped or have heads like snakes,
14	43	Nor the bos Gaurus, the Gayal, and the Sarabha,
14	44	Nor those that have not been (specially mentioned (as fit for food),
14	45	Nor milch-cows, draught-oxen, and animals whose milk teeth have not dropped out.
14	46	It is declared in the Vâgasaneyaka, that (the flesh of) milch-cows and oxen is fit for offerings.
14	47	But regarding the rhinoceros and the wild boar they make conflicting statements.
14	48	And among birds, those who seek their food by scratching with their feet, the web-footed ones, the Kalaviṅka, the water-hen, the flamingo, the [paragraph continues] Brahmanî duck, the Bhâsa, the crow, the blue pigeon, the osprey, the Kâtaka, the dove, the crane, the black partridge, the grey heron, the vulture, the falcon, the white egret, the ibis, the cormorant, the peewit, the flying-fox, those flying about at night, the woodpecker, the sparrow, the Railâtaka, the green pigeon, the wagtail, the village-cock, the parrot, the starling, the cuckoo, those feeding on flesh, and those living about villages (must not be eaten).
15	1	Man formed of uterine blood and virile seed proceeds from his mother and his father (as an effect) from its cause.
15	2	(Therefore) the father and the mother have power to give, to sell, and to abandon their (son).
15	3	But let him not give or receive (in adoption) an only son;
15	4	For he (must remain) to continue the line of the ancestors.
15	5	Let a woman neither give nor receive a son except with her husband's permission.
15	6	He who desires to adopt a son, shall assemble his kinsmen, announce his intention to the king, make burnt-offerings in the middle of the house, reciting the Vyâhritis, and take (as a son) a not remote kinsman, just the nearest among his relatives.
15	7	But if a doubt arises (with respect to an adopted son who is) a remote kinsman, (the adopter) shall set him apart like a Sûdra.
15	8	For it is declared in the Veda, 'Through one he saves many.'
15	9	If, after an adoption has been made, a legitimate son be born, (the adopted son) shall obtain a fourth part,
15	10	Provided he be not engaged in (rites) procuring prosperity.
15	11	He who divulges the Veda (to persons not authorised to study it), he who sacrifices for Sûdras, (and all those) who have fallen from the rank of the highest caste (shall be excommunicated by the ceremony of) emptying the water-vessel.
15	12	A slave or the son of a wife of a lower caste, or a relative not belonging to the same caste, who is destitute of good qualities, shall fetch a broken pot from a heap of vessels unfit for use, place Kusa grass, the tops of which have been cut off, or Lohita grass (on the ground), and empty the pot for the (outcast, overturning it) with his left foot;
15	13	And the relatives of the (outcast), allowing their hair to hang down, shall touch him who empties (the pot).
15	14	Turning (when they leave) their left hands towards (that spot), they may go home at pleasure.
15	15	Let them not afterwards admit the (excommunicated person) to sacred rites.
15	16	Those who admit him to sacred rites become his equals.
15	17	But outcasts who have performed (the prescribed) penance (may be) readmitted.
15	18	Now they quote also (the following verse):[paragraph continues] 'Let him walk before those who readmit him, like one gamboling and laughing. Let him walk behind those who excommunicate him, like one weeping and sorrowing.'
15	19	Those who strike their teacher, their mother, or their father may be readmitted in the following manner, either after being pardoned by the (persons offended) or after expiating their sin.
15	20	Having filled a golden or an earthen vessel (with water taken) from a sacred lake or river, they pour (the water) over him, (reciting the three verses) 'Ye waters are' &c.
15	21	All the (other ceremonies to be performed on the) readmission of one who has bathed (in this manner) have been explained by (those ordained an) the birth of a son.
16	1	Now (follow the rules regarding) legal proceedings.
16	2	Let the king (or) his minister transact the business on the bench.
16	3	When two (parties) have a dispute, let him not be partial to one of them.
16	4	Let him reason properly regarding an offence; finally the offence (will become evident thereby).
16	5	He who properly reasons regarding an offence, in accordance with the sum of the science of the first two castes, is equitable towards all created beings.
16	6	And let him protect what has been gained;
16	7	(Likewise) the property of infants (of the) royal (race).
16	8	(Likewise the property) of persons unfit to transact legal business (minors, widows, and so forth).
16	9	But if (a minor) comes of age, his property must be made over to him.
16	10	'It is declared in the Smriti that there are three kinds of proof which give a title to (property, viz.) documents, witnesses, and possession; (thereby) an owner may recover property which formerly belonged to him (but was lost).'
16	11	From fields through which (there is a right of) road (a space sufficient for the road) must be set apart, likewise a space for turning (a cart).
16	12	Near new-built houses (and) other things (of the same description there shall be) a passage three feet broad.
16	13	In a dispute about a house or a field, reliance (may be placed on the depositions of) neighbours.
16	14	If the statements of the neighbours disagree, documents (may be taken as) proof.
16	15	If conflicting documents are produced, reliance (may be placed) on (the statements of) aged (inhabitants) of the village or town, and on (those of) guilds and corporations (of artisans or traders).
16	16	Now they quote also (the following verse): 'Property inherited from a father, a thing bought, a pledge, property given to a wife after marriage by her husband's family, a gift, property obtained for performing a sacrifice, the property of reunited coparceners, and wages as the eighth.'
16	17	Whatever belonging to these (eight kinds of property) has been enjoyed (by another person) for ten years continuously (is lost to the owner).
16	18	They quote also (a verse) on the other side: 'A pledge, a boundary, and the property of minor's, an (open) deposit, a sealed deposit, women, the property of a king, (and) the wealth of a Srotriya are not lost by being enjoyed (by others).'
16	19	Property entirely given up (by its owner) goes to the king.
16	20	If it be otherwise, the king with his ministers and the citizens shall administer it.
16	21	A king will be superior even to Brahman if he lives surrounded by servants (who are keen-eyed) like vultures.
16	22	But a king will not be exalted if he lives surrounded by servants (who are greedy) like vultures.
16	23	Let him live surrounded by servants (who are keen-eyed) like vultures, let him not be a vulture surrounded by vultures.
16	24	For through his servants blemishes become manifest (in his kingdom),
16	25	(Such as) theft, robbery, oppression, and (so forth).
16	26	Therefore let him question his servants before-hand.
16	27	Now (follow the rules regarding) witnesses:
16	28	Srotriyas, men of unblemished form, of good character, men who are holy and love truth (are fit to be) witnesses,
16	29	Or (men of) any (caste may give evidence) regarding (men of) any (other caste).
16	30	Let him make women witnesses regarding women; for twice-born men twice-born men of the same caste (shall be witnesses), and good Sûdras for Sûdras, and men of low birth for low-caste men.
16	31	Now they quote also (the following verse): 'A son need not pay money due by a surety, any-thing idly promised, money due for losses at play or for spirituous liquor, nor what remains unpaid of a fine or a toll.'
16	32	'Depose, O witness, according to the truth; expecting thy answer, thy ancestors hang in suspense;[paragraph continues] (in accordance with its truth or falsehood) they will rise (to heaven) or fall (into hell).'
16	33	'Naked and shorn, tormented with hunger and thirst, and deprived of sight shall the man who gives false evidence go with a potsherd to beg food at the door of his enemy.'
16	34	'He kills five by false testimony regarding a maiden; he kills ten by false testimony regarding kine; he kills a hundred by false evidence regarding a horse, and a thousand by false evidence regarding a man.'
16	35	(Men) may speak an untruth at the time of marriage, during dalliance, when their lives are in danger or the loss of their whole property is imminent, and for the sake of a Brâhmana; they declare that an untruth spoken in these five cases does not make (the speaker) an outcast.
16	36	Those who give partial evidence in a judicial proceeding for the sake of a relative or for money, deprive the ancestors of their spiritual family and those of their natural family of their place in heaven.
17	1	The father throws his debts on the (son) and obtains immortality if he sees the face of a living son.
17	2	It is declared in the Veda, 'Endless are the worlds of those who have sons; there is no place for the man who is destitute of male offspring.'
17	3	There is a curse (in the Veda), 'May our enemies be destitute of offspring.'
17	4	There is also (the following) passage of the Veda, 'May I obtain, O Agni, immortality by offspring.'
17	5	'Through a son he conquers the worlds, through a grandson he obtains immortality, but through his son's grandson he gains the world of the sun.'
17	6	There is a dispute (among the wise; some say), The son belongs to the husband of the wife;' (and some say), 'The son belongs to the begetter.'
17	7	With respect to this (matter) they quote also on both sides verses like the following:
17	8	(Some say), 'If (one man's) bull were to beget a hundred calves on another man's cows, they would belong to the owner of the cows; in vain would the bull have spent his strength.'
17	9	(Others say), 'Carefully watch the procreation of your offspring, lest strangers sow seed on your soil; in the next world the son belongs to the begetter; (by carelessness) a husband makes (the possession of) offspring in vain.'
17	10	If amongst many brothers who are begotten by one father, one have a son, they all have offspring through that son; thus says the Veda.
17	11	If among many wives of one husband, one have a son, they all have offspring through that son; thus says the Veda.
17	12	Twelve (kinds of) sons only are noticed by the ancients.
17	13	The first (among these is the son) begotten by the husband himself on his legally married wife.
17	14	The second is the son of a wife (who is begotten) on failure of the (first) on a (wife or widow duly) authorised (thereto, by a kinsman).
17	15	The third is an appointed daughter.
17	16	It is declared in the Veda, 'A maiden who has no brothers comes back to the male ancestors (of her own family); returning she becomes their son.'
17	17	With reference to this (matter there is) a verse (to be spoken by the father when appointing daughter), 'I shall give thee a brotherless damsel, decked with ornaments; the son whom she may bear, shall be my son.'
17	18	The fourth is the son of a remarried woman.
17	19	She is called remarried (punarbhû) who leaving the husband of her youth, and having lived with others, re-enters his family;
17	20	And she is called remarried who leaving an impotent, outcast or mad husband, or after the death of her husband takes another lord.
17	21	The fifth is the son of an unmarried damsel.
17	22	They declare that the son whom an unmarried damsel produces through lust in her father's house, is the son of his maternal grandfather.
17	23	Now they quote also (the following verse): If an unmarried daughter bear a son begotten by a man of equal caste, the maternal grandfather has a son through him; he shall offer the funeral cake, and take the wealth (of his grandfather).'
17	24	(A male child) secretly born in the house is the sixth.
17	25	They declare that these (six) are heirs and kinsmen, preservers from a great danger.
17	26	Now among those (sons) who are not heirs, but kinsmen, the first is he who is received with a pregnant bride.
17	27	(The son of a damsel) who is married pregnant (is called) a son received with the bride (sahodha).
17	28	The second is the adopted son,
17	29	(He) whom his father and his mother give (in adoption).
17	30	(The son) bought is the third.
17	31	That is explained by (the story of) Sunahsepa.
17	32	'Hariskandra, forsooth, was a king. He bought the son of Agîgarta Sauyavasi.
17	33	The fourth is (the son) self-given.
17	34	That is (likewise) explained by (the story of) Sunahsepa.
17	35	'Sunahsepa, forsooth, when tied to the sacrificial stake, praised the gods; there the gods loosened his bonds. To him poke (each of) the officiating priests, "He shall be my son." He did not agree to their (request. Then) they made him make (this) agreement, "He shall be the son of him whom he chooses." Visvâmitra was the Hotri priest at that (sacrifice). He became his son.'
17	36	The son cast off is the fifth.
17	37	(He is called so) who, cast off by his father and his mother, is received (as a son).
17	38	They declare that the son of a woman of the Sûdra caste is the sixth. These (six) are kinsmen, not heirs.
17	39	Now they quote also (the following rule): 'These (last-mentioned) six (sons) shall take the heritage of him who has no heir belonging to the first-mentioned six (classes).
17	40	Now (follow the rules regarding) the partition of the (paternal) estate among brothers:
17	41	And (let it be delayed) until those (widows) who have no offspring, (but are supposed to be pregnant), bear sons.
17	42	Let the eldest take a double share,
17	43	And a tithe of the kine and horses.
17	44	The goats, the sheep, and the house belong to the youngest,
17	45	Black iron, the utensils, and the furniture to the middlemost.
17	46	Let the daughters divide the nuptial present of their mother.
17	47	If a Brâhmana has issue by wives belonging to the Brâhmana, Kshatriya, and Vaisya classes respectively,
17	48	The son of the Brâhmana wife shall receive three shares,
17	49	The son of the Kshatriya wife two shares,
17	50	The other (sons) shall inherit equal shares.
17	51	And if one of the (brothers) has gained something by his own (effort), he shall receive a double share.
17	52	But those who have entered a different order receive no share,
17	53	Nor (those who are) eunuchs, madmen, or outcasts.
17	54	Eunuchs and madmen (have a claim to) maintenance.
17	55	The widow of a deceased person shall sleep on the ground during six months, practising religious vows and abstaining from pungent condiments and salt.
17	56	After the completion of six months she shall bathe, and offer a funeral oblation to her husband. (Then) her father or her brother shall assemble the Gurus who taught or sacrificed (for the deceased) and his relatives, and shall appoint her (to raise issue to her deceased husband).
17	57	Let him not appoint a (widow who is) mad, ill-conducted, or diseased,
17	58	Nor one who is very aged.
17	59	Sixteen years (after maturity is the period for appointing a widow);
17	60	Nor (shall an appointment be made) if the (male entitled to approach the widow) is sickly.
17	61	Let him approach (the widow) in the muhûarta sacred to. Pragâpati, (behaving) like a husband, without (amorously) dallying with her, and without abusing or ill-treating her.
17	62	Let her obtain (the expenses for) food, raiment, baths, and unguents from (the estate of) her former (husband).
17	63	They declare that a son begotten on (a widow who has) not been (duly) appointed, belongs to the begetter.
17	64	If she was (appointed, the child belongs) to both the males connected with the appointment.
17	65	No appointment (shall be made) through a desire to obtain the estate.
17	66	Some say, 'Or, one may appoint (a widow out of covetousness), after imposing a penance.'
17	67	, A maiden who has attained puberty shall wait for three years.
17	68	After three years (have passed), she may take a. husband of equal caste.
17	69	Now they quote also (the following verses) But if through a father's negligence a maiden is here given away after the suitable age has passed, she who was waiting (for a husband) destroys him who gives her away, just as the fee which is paid too late to the teacher (destroys the pupil).'
17	70	'Out of fear of the appearance of the menses let the father marry his daughter while she still runs about naked. For if she stays (in the house) after the age of puberty, sin falls on the father.'
17	71	'As often as the courses of a maiden, who is filled with desire, and demanded in marriage by men of equal caste, recur, so often her father and her mother are guilty of (the crime of) slaying an embryo; that is a rule of the sacred law.'
17	72	'If the betrothed of a maiden die after she has been promised to him verbally, and by (a libation of) water, but before she was married with (the recitation of) sacred texts, she belongs to her father alone.'
17	73	'If a damsel has been abducted by force, and not been wedded with sacred texts, she may lawfully be given to another man; she is even like a maiden.'
17	74	'If a damsel at the death of her husband had been merely wedded by (the recitation of) sacred texts, and if the marriage had not been consummated, she may be married again.'
17	75	The wife of an emigrant shall wait for five years.
17	76	After five years (have passed), she may go (to seek) her husband.
17	77	If for reasons connected with spiritual or with money matters she be unwilling to leave her home, she must act in the same manner as if (her husband were) dead.
17	78	In this manner a wife of the Brâhmana caste who has issue (shall wait) five years, and one who has no issue, four years; a wife of the Kshatriya caste who has issue, five years, and one who has no issue, three years; a wife of the Vaisya caste whohas issue, four years, and one who has no issue, two years; a wife of the Sûdra caste who has issue, three years, and one who has no issue, one year.
17	79	After that among those who are united (with her husband) in interest, or by birth, or by the funeral cake, or by libations of water, or by descent from the same family, each earlier named person is more venerable than the following ones.
17	80	But while a member of her family is living, she shall certainly not go to a stranger.
17	81	Let the Sapindas or the subsidiary sons divide the heritage of him who has no heir of the first-mentioned six kinds.
17	82	On failure of them the spiritual teacher and a pupil shall take the inheritance.
17	83	On failure of those two the king inherits.
17	84	But let the king not take (the estate) of a Brâhmana.
17	85	For the property of a Brâhmana is a terrible poison.
17	86	'Poison they do not call the (worst) poison; the property of a Brâhmana is said to be the (most destructive) poison. Poison destroys only one person, but the property of a Brâhmana (him who takes it) together with sons and grandsons.'
17	87	He should give it to men who are well versed in the three Vedas.
18	1	They declare that the offspring of a Sûdra and of a female of the Brâhmana caste becomes a Kândâla,
18	2	(That of a Sûdra and) of a female of the Kshatriya caste, a Vaina,
18	3	(That of a Sûdra and) of a female of the Vaisya caste, an Antyâvasâyin.
18	4	They declare that the (son) begotten by a Vaisya on a female of the Brâhmana caste becomes a Râmaka,
18	5	(The son begotten by the same) on a female of the Kshatriya caste, a Pulkasa.
18	6	They declare that the (son) begotten by a Kshatriya on a female of the Brâhmana caste becomes a Sûta.
18	7	Now they quote also (the following verse): 'One may know by their deeds those who have been begotten secretly, and to whom the stigma of springing from unions in the inverse order of the castes attaches, because they are destitute of virtue and good conduct.'
18	8	(Children) begotten by Brâhmanas, Kshatriyas, and Vaisyas on females of the next lower, second lower, and third lower castes become (respectively) Ambashthas, Ugras, and Nishâdas.
18	9	(The son of a Brâhmana and) of a Sûdra woman (is) a Pârasava.
18	10	They declare that the condition of a Pârasava is that of one who, though living, is (as impure) as a corpse.
18	11	Some call that Sûdra race a burial-ground.
18	12	Therefore (the Veda) must not be recited in the presence of a Sûdra.
18	13	Now they quote also the (following) verses, which Yama proclaimed:'The wicked Sûdra-race is manifestly a burial-ground. Therefore (the Veda) must never be recited in the presence of a Sûdra.'
18	14	'Let him not give advice to a Sûdra, nor what remains from his table, nor (remnants of) offerings (to the gods); nor let him explain the holy law to such a man, nor order him (to perform) a penance.'
18	15	'He who declares the law to such a man, and he who instructs him in (the mode of) expiating (sin), sinks together with that very man into the dreadful hell, (called) Asamvrita.'
18	16	'If ever a worm is produced in an open wound (on his body), he shall purify himself by the Prâgâpatya penance, and give gold, a cow, (and) a garment as presents (to Brâhmanas).'
18	17	Let him not approach a wife of the Sûdra caste after he has built the fire-altar for a Srauta-sacrifice.
18	18	For a Sûdra-wife who belongs to the black race, (is espoused) for pleasure, not in order to fulfil the law.
19	1	The particular duty of a king is to protect (all) beings; by fulfilling it (he obtains) success (in this world and in the next).
19	2	Those learned (in the sacred law) declare that to be free from fear and pity is, indeed, a life-long sacrificial session (sattra, to be performed by the king).
19	3	Therefore let him appoint a domestic priest to (perform the rites) obligatory on the order of householders.
19	4	It is declared in the Veda, 'A realm where a Brâhmana is appointed domestic priest, prospers;'
19	5	For thus both (the special duties of a king and those of a householder) will be fulfilled,
19	6	And (the king alone is) unable (to do both).
19	7	Let the king, paying attention to all the laws of countries, (subdivisions of) castes (gâti) and families, make the four castes (varna) fulfil their (respective) particular duties.
19	8	Let him punish those who stray from (the path of duty).
19	9	But punishment must be awarded in cases of assault and abuse after (due consideration of) the particular place and time (where and when the offence was committed), of the duties, age, learning (of the parties), and the seat (of the injury),
19	10	In accordance with (the precepts of) the (sacred) records and with precedents.
19	11	Let him not injure trees that bear fruit or flowers.
19	12	(But) he may injure them in order to extend cultivation and (for sacrifices).
19	13	The measures and weights of objects necessary for households must be guarded (against falsification).
19	14	Let him not take property for his own use from (the inhabitants of) his realm.
19	15	The measures and price (of such property) only shall be liable to deductions (in the shape of taxes).
19	16	.     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .
19	17	On the march against the enemy the army which consists of companies of ten, shall be able to perform a double (duty).
19	18	In every (camp) there shall be places where water is distributed.
19	19	Let him make one hundred men at the least engage in battle.
19	20	The wives (of slain soldiers) shall be provided for.
19	21	.     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .
19	22	A ferry shall be taken away (from a river) in which there is no water.
19	23	A Srotriya is free from taxes, (and so are) a servant of the king, one who has no protector, one who has left (the order of householders), an infant, a very aged man, a young man (who studies), and pradâtâs;
19	24	(Moreover widows) who return to their former (family), unmarried maidens, and the wives of servants,
19	25	He who swims with his arms (across a river in order to escape payment of a toll at a ferry) shall pay one hundred times (the amount due).
19	26	No taxes (shall be paid) on the usufruct of rivers, dry grass, forests, (places of) combustion, and mountains;
19	27	Or those who draw their subsistence from them may pay (something),
19	28	But he shall take a monthly tax from artisans.
19	29	And when a king has died, let him give what is required for the occasion.
19	30	It is hereby explained that (his) mother (must receive) maintenance.
19	31	Let the king maintain the paternal and maternal uncles of the chief-queen,
19	32	As well as her other relatives.
19	33	The wives of the (deceased) king shall receive food and raiment,
19	34	Or if they are unwilling, they may depart.
19	35	Let the king maintain eunuchs and madmen,
19	36	Since their property goes to him.
19	37	Now they quote also a verse proclaimed by Manu, which refers to duties and. taxes, 'No duty (is paid) on a sum less than a Karshâpana, there is no tax on a livelihood gained by art, nor on an infant, nor on a messenger, nor on what has been received as alms, nor on the remnants of property left after a robbery, nor on a Srotriya, nor on an ascetic, nor on a sacrifice.'
19	38	A thief becomes free from guilt by entering (the royal presence) after (his deed and asking to be punished).
19	39	But according to some (lawyers) he (who is caught) with weapons in his hands, with stolen goods in his possession, or covered with wounds is proved (to be a criminal).
19	40	In case (a criminal) worthy of punishment is allowed to go free, the king shall fast during one (day and one) night;
19	41	(And) his domestic priest during three (days and) nights.
19	42	If an innocent man is punished, the domestic priest (shall perform) a Krikkhra penance;
19	43	(And) the king (shall fast) during three (days and) nights.
19	44	Now they quote also (the following verses): 'The slayer of a learned Brâhmana casts his guilt on him who eats his food; an adulterous wife on her (negligent) husband; a student and a sacrificer on an (ignorant) teacher (and officiating priest); and a thief on the king (who pardons him).'
19	45	'But men who have committed offences and have received from kings the punishment (due to them), go pure to heaven, and (become) as holy as the virtuous.'
19	46	'The guilt falls on the king who pardons anoffender. If he causes him to be slain, he destroys sin in accordance with the sacred law.'
19	47	'It is ordained that kings become at once pure (by bathing) when they have done acts causing death. They are likewise (pure while engaged in business) not causing death. Time is the reason for that.'
19	48	And with reference to this (matter) they quote a verse proclaimed by Yama, 'No taint of impurity, forsooth, falls on kings, on those engaged . in practising vows, or on those engaged in the performance of sacrificial session (sattra); for (the first) are seated on the throne of Indra, (and the others) are always equal to Brahman.'
20	1	A penance (shall be performed) for an offence committed unintentionally.
20	2	Some (declare that it shall be performed) also for (a fault) committed intentionally.
20	3	'The spiritual teacher corrects the learned; the king corrects the evil-minded; but Yama, the son of Vivasvat, forsooth, punishes those who offend secretly.'
20	4	And among those (sinful persons), let him who slept at sunrise stand during the (following) day and recite the verse sacred to Savitri.
20	5	Let him who slept at sunset remain in a sitting posture during the (next) night, likewise (reciting the Gâyatrî).
20	6	But let a man with deformed nails or black teeth perform a Krikkhra penance of twelve days' duration.
20	7	He whose younger brother married first shall perform a Krikkhra penance during twelve days, marry and take to himself even that (woman whom his brother wedded).
20	8	Now he who has taken a wife before his elder brother shall perform a Krikkhra penance and an Atikrikkhra penance, give (his wife) to that (elder brother), marry again, and take (back) the same (woman whom he wedded first).
20	9	The husband of a younger sister married before her elder sister shall perform a Krikkhra penance during twelve days, marry and take to him that (elder sister).
20	10	The husband of an elder sister married after the younger one shall perform a Krikkhra penance and an Atikrikkhra penance, give (his wife) to that (husband of the younger sister and marry again).
20	11	We shall, declare below (the penance prescribed for) him who extinguishes the sacred fire.
20	12	He who has forgot the Veda (by neglecting to recite it daily), shall perform a Krikkhra penance of twelve days' duration, and again learn it from his teacher.
20	13	He who violates a Guru's bed shall cut off his organ, together with the testicles, take them into his joined hands and walk towards the south wherever he meets with an obstacle (to further progress), there he shall stand until he dies:
20	14	Or, having shaved all his hair and smeared his body with clarified butter, he shall embrace the heated (iron) image (of a woman). It is declared in the Veda that he is. purified after death,
20	15	The same (expiation is prescribed if the offence was committed) with the wife of the teacher, of a son, and of a pupil.
20	16	If he has had intercourse with a female (who is considered) venerable in the family, with a female friend, with the female friend of a Guru, with an Apapâtra female, or with an outcast, he shall perform a Krikkhra penance during three months.
20	17	The same (penance must be performed) for eating food given by a Kândâla or by an outcast. Afterwards the initiation (must be performed) once more; but the tonsure and the rest may be omitted.
20	18	And with reference to this (matter) they quote a verse proclaimed by Manu, 'The tonsure, (the tying on of) the sacred girdle, (the wearing of) a staff, and the begging of alias, these acts may be omitted on a second initiation.'
20	19	If (a Brâhmana) intentionally (drinks) other spirituous liquor than that distilled from rice, or if he unintentionally (drinks) spirituous liquor extracted from rice (surâ), he (must perform) a Krikkhra and an Atikrikkhra, and, after eating clarified butter, be initiated again.
20	20	The same (expiation is prescribed) for swallowing ordure, urine, and semen.
20	21	If a Brâhmana drinks water which has stood in a vessel used for (keeping) spirituous liquor, he becomes pure by drinking, during three days, water (mixed with a decoction) of lotus, Udumbara, Bilva, and Palâsa (leaves).
20	22	But a Brâhmana who repeatedly (and intentionally partakes) of liquor extracted from rice, shall drink (liquor of) the same (kind) boiling hot. 'He becomes pure after death.'
20	23	We will declare (who must be considered) the slayer of a learned Brâhmana (bhrûnahan). He is called Bhrûnahan who kills a Brâhmana or destroys an embryo (the sex of) which is unknown.
20	24	'For embryos (the sex of) which is unknown become males; therefore they offer burnt-oblations for the production of males.'
20	25	Let the slayer of a learned Brâhmana kindle a fire and offer (therein the following eight oblations, consisting of portions of his own body),
20	26	The first (saying), 'I offer my hair to Death, I feed Death with my hair;' the second (saying), I offer my skin to Death, I feed Death with my skin;' the third (saying), 'I offer my blood to Death, I feed Death with my blood;' the fourth (saying), I offer my flesh to Death, I feed Death with my flesh;' the fifth (saying), 'I offer my sinews to Death, I feed Death with my sinews;' the sixth (saying), 'I offer my fat to Death, I feed Death with my fat;' the seventh (saying), 'I offer my bones to Death, I feed Death with my bones;' the eighth (saying), 'I offer my marrow to Death, I feed Death with my marrow.'
20	27	(Or) let him (fight) for the sake of the king, or for the sake of Brâhmanas, and let him die in battle with his face turned (to the foe).
20	28	It is declared in the Veda, '(A murderer) who remains thrice unvanquished or is thrice defeated (in battle) becomes pure.'
20	29	'A sin which is openly proclaimed becomes smaller.'
20	30	To this (effect) they quote also (the following verse): 'By saying to an outcast, "O thou outcast!" or to a thief, "O thou thief!" a man incurs a guilt as great as (that of the offender). (If he) falsely (accuses anybody of such offences), his guilt will be twice as great.'
20	31	In like manner having slain a Kshatriya, he shall perform (a penance) during eight years,
20	32	For (killing) a Vaisya during six (years),
20	33	For (killing) a Sûdra, during three (years),
20	34	For killing a female of the Brâhmana caste who is an Atreyî, and a Kshatriya or a Vaisya, engaged in a sacrifice (the same penance must be performed as for killing a learned Brâhmana).
20	35	We will explain (the term) Atreyî. They declare that she who has bathed after temporary uncleanness is an Atreyî.
20	36	'For if (the husband) approaches her at that (time), he will have offspring.'
20	37	(For killing a female of the Brâhmana caste) who is not an Âtreyî, (the penance prescribed) for the murder of a Kshatriya (must be performed),
20	38	(For killing) a female of the Kshatriya caste, (the penance prescribed) for the murder of a Vaisya,
20	39	(For killing) a female of the Vaisya caste, (the penance prescribed) for the murder of a Sûdra.
20	40	(For killing) a female of the Sûdra caste (let him perform) during one year (the penance prescribed for the murder of a Brâhmana).
20	41	If a man has stolen gold belonging to a Brâhmana, he shall run, with flying hair, to the king, (exclaiming) 'Ho, I am a thief; sir, punish me!' The king shall give him a weapon made of Udumbara wood; with that he shall kill himself. It is declared in the Veda that he becomes pure after death.
20	42	Or (such a thief) may shave off all his hair, anoint his body with clarified butter, and cause himself to be burnt from the feet upwards, in a fire of dry cowdung. It is declared in the Veda that he becomes pure after death.
20	43	Now they quote also (the following verses): 'Hear, (how) the bodies of those who having committed various crimes died a long time ago, and were (afterwards) born again, are (marked);'
20	44	'A thief will have deformed nails, the murderer of a Brâhmana will be afflicted with white leprosy, but he who has drunk spirituous liquor will have black teeth, and the violator of his Guru's bed will suffer from skin diseases.'
20	45	Property received from outcasts, after forming alliances with them either by (teaching) the Veda (and by sacrificing) or by marriage, must be relinquished. Let him not associate with such (men).
20	46	It is declared in the Veda that (he who has associated with outcasts) becomes pure by reciting the Samhitâ (of his Veda), proceeding in a northerly direction and fasting.
20	47	They quote also (a verse) to this (effect), 'A sinner is liberated from guilt by tormenting his body, by austerities, and by reciting the Veda; he becomes also free by bestowing gifts. That has been declared in the Veda.'
21	1	If a Sûdra approaches a female of the Brâhmana caste, (the king) shall cause the Sûdra to be tied up in Vîrana grass and shall throw him into a fire. He shall cause the head of the Brâhmanî to be shaved, and her body to be anointed with butter; placing her naked on a black donkey, he shall cause her to be conducted along the highroad. It is declared that she becomes pure (thereby).
21	2	If a Vaisya approaches a female of the Brâhmana caste, (the king) shall cause the Vaisya to be tied up in Lohita grass and shall throw him into a fire. He shall cause the head of the Brâhmanî to be shaved, and her body to be anointed with butter; placing her naked on a yellowish donkey, he shall cause her to be conducted along the highroad. It is declared in the Veda that she becomes pure (thereby).
21	3	If a Kshatriya approaches a female of the Brâhmana caste, (the king) shall cause the Kshatriya to be tied up in leaves of Sara grass and shall throw him into a fire. He shall cause the head of the Brâhmanî to be shaved, and her body to be anointed with butter; placing her naked on a white donkey, he shall cause her to be conducted along the highroad. It is declared in the Veda that she becomes pure (thereby).
21	4	A Vaisya who offends) with a female of the Kshatriya class (shall be treated) in the same manner,
21	5	And a Sûdra (who offends) with females of the Kshatriya or Vaisya castes.
21	6	If (a wife) has been mentally unfaithful to her husband, she shall live on barley or rice boiled in milk during three days, and sleep on the bare ground. After the three days (have expired), the (husband) shall offer eight hundred burnt-oblations, (reciting) the Sâvitrî (and the Mantra called) Siras, while she is immersed in water. It is declared in the Veda that she becomes pure (thereby).
21	7	If (a wife) has held an (improper) conversation (with another man), she must perform the same penance during a month. After (the expiration of) the month, (the husband) shall offer four times eight hundred burnt-oblations, (reciting) the Sâvitrî (and the Mantra called) Siras, while she is immersed in water. It is declared in the Veda that she becomes pure (thereby).
21	8	But if (a wife) has actually committed adultery, she shall wear during a year a garment smeared with clarified butter, and sleep on a mat of Kusa grass, or in a pit filled with cowdung. After (the expiration of) the year, (the husband) shall offer eight hundred burnt-oblations, (reciting) the Sâvitrî (and the Mantra called) Siras, while she is immersed in water. It is declared in the Veda that she becomes pure (thereby).
21	9	But if she commits adultery with a Guru, she is forbidden (to assist her husband) in (the fulfilment of) his sacred duties.
21	10	But (these) four (wives) must be abandoned, (viz.) one who yields herself to (her husband's) pupil or to (his) Guru, and especially one who attempts the life of her lord, or who commits adultery with a man of a degraded caste.
21	11	That woman of the Brâhmana caste who drinks spirituous liquor, the gods will not admit (after death) to the same abode with her husband; losing all spiritual merit she wanders about in this world and is born again as a leech or a pearl-oyster.
21	12	The wives of Brâhmanas, Kshatriyas, and Vaisyas who commit adultery with a Sûdra may be purified by a penance in case no child is born (from their adulterous intercourse), not otherwise.
21	13	(Those who have committed adultery) with a man of lower caste shall perform a Krikkhra penance, succeeded by one, two, or three Kândrâyana.
21	14	Faithful wives who are constantly pure and truthful (reside after death) in the same abodes with their husbands; those who are unfaithful are born as jackals.
21	15	Half the body of the husband falls if his wife drinks spirituous liquor. No purification is prescribed for the half which has fallen.
21	16	If a Brâhmana unintentionally commits adultery with the wife of a Brâhmana, (he shall perform) a Krikkhra penance in case (the husband) fulfils the religious duties (of his caste), and an Atikrikkhra penance in case (the husband) does not fulfil his religious duties.
21	17	The same (penances are prescribed) for Kshatriyas and Vaisyas (for adultery with women of their respective castes).
21	18	If he kills a cow, let him perform, during six months, a Krikkhra or a Taptakrikkhra, dressed in the raw hide of that (cow).
21	19	The rule for these two (penances is as follows):
21	20	'During three days he eats in the day-time (only), and during the (next) three days at night (only), he subsists during (another) period of three days on food offered without asking, and (finally) he fasts during three days.' That is a Krikkhra penance.
21	21	'Let him drink hot water during three days; let him drink hot milk during the (next) three days; after drinking during (another) period of three days hot clarified butter, he shall subsist on air during the (last) three days.' That is a Taptakrikkhra penance.
21	22	And he shall give (to a Brâhmana) a bull and a cow.
21	23	Now they quote also (the following verse): 'Through killing a spotted deer, a he-goat, and a bird three maladies (befal men), viz. jealousy, hunger, and old age; (therefore) let him (who is guilty of such an offence) perform (a penance) during ninety-eight (days).'
21	24	Having slain a dog, a cat, an ichneumon, a snake, a frog, or a rat, let him perform a Krikkhra penance of twelve days' duration, and give something (to a Brâhmana).
21	25	But having slain a quantity of boneless animals, equal to the weight of a cow, let him perform a Krikkhra penance of twelve days' duration, and give something (to a Brâhmana).
21	26	But (the same penance must be performed) for each single (slain animal) that possesses bones.
21	27	He who extinguishes the (sacred) fires shall perform a Krikkhra penance of twelve days, and cause them to be kindled again (by priests engaged for the occasion).
21	28	He who falsely accuses a Guru shall bathe, dressed in his clothes, and ask his Guru's pardon. It is declared in the Veda that he becomes pure by the Guru's forgiving him.
21	29	An atheist shall perform a Krikkhra penance of twelve days' duration, and give up his infidelity.
21	30	But he who receives subsistence from infidels (shall perform) an Atikrikkhra penance (and not repeat his offence).
21	31	(The rule applicable to) a seller of Soma has been explained hereby.
21	32	A hermit, on violating the rules of his order, shall perform a Krikkhra penance of twelve days' duration, and continue (the observances obligatory on him) in a great forest.
21	33	Ascetics, (offending in the same manner) as hermits, shall perform for a protracted period (the vow of regulating the quantity of their food according to) the growth of the moon, and shall again be initiated, in accordance with (the rules of) the Institutes applicable to them.
22	1	Now, indeed, man (in) this (world) speaks an untruth, or sacrifices for men unworthy to offer a sacrifice, or accepts what ought not to be accepted, or eats forbidden food, or practises what ought not to be practised.
22	2	They are in doubt if he shall perform a penance for such (a deed), or if he shall not do it.
22	3	(Some) declare that he shall not do it,
22	4	Because the deed does not perish.
22	5	(The correct view is, that) he shall perform (a penance), because it is enjoined in the revealed texts,
22	6	'He who offers a horse-sacrifice conquers all sin, he destroys the guilt of the murder of a Brâhmana.'
22	7	(Moreover), 'Let an Abhisasta offer a Gosava or an Agnishtut-sacrifice,'
22	8	Reciting the Veda, austerity, a sacrifice, fasting, giving gifts are the means for expiating such a (blamable act).
22	9	(The purificatory texts are) the Upanishads, the Vedântas, the Samhitâ-text of all the Vedas, the (Anuvâkas called) Madhu, the (hymn of) Aghamarshana,  the Atharvasiras, the (Anuvâkas called) Rudras, the Purusha-hymn, the two Sâmans called Râgana and Rauhineya, the Kûshmândas, the Pâvamânîs, and the Sâvitrî,
22	10	Now they quote also (the following verse): 'He who performs once in each season the offerings to Vaisvânara and Vratapati and the Pavitreshti sanctifies ten ancestors.'
22	11	To live on milk alone, as if one were fasting, to eat fruit only, (to live on) barley gruel prepared of a handful of grain, to eat gold, to drink Soma (are modes of subsistence which) purify.
22	12	All mountains, all rivers, holy lakes, places of pilgrimage, the dwellings of Rishis, cowpens, and temples of the gods (are) places (which destroy sin).
22	13	A year, a month, twenty-four days, twelve days, six days, three days, a day and a night are the periods (for penances).
22	14	These (acts) may be optionally performed when no (particular penance) has been prescribed,
22	15	(Viz.) for great sins difficult (penances), and for trivial faults easy ones.
22	16	The Krikkhra and the Atikrikkhra (as well as) the Kândrâyana are penances for all (offences).
23	1	If a student has approached a woman, he shall slay in the forest, in a place where four roads meet [paragraph continues] (kindling) a common fire, an ass for the Rakshas (the goblins),
23	2	Or he may offer an oblation of rice (karu) to Nirriti (the goddess of hell).
23	3	Let him throw into the fire (four oblations consisting) of that (sacrificial food, saying), To Lust svâhâ; to him who follows his lust svâhâ; to Nirriti svâhâ; to the divine Rakshas svâhâ.'
23	4	If, before returning home (from his teacher, a student) voluntarily defiles himself, sleeps in the day-time, or practises any other vow (than that of studentship), the same (penance must be performed).
23	5	If he has committed a bestial crime, he shall give a white bull (to a Brâhmana).
23	6	The guilt incurred by a bestial crime with a cow, has been explained by the (rule regarding) the killing of a female of the Sûdra caste.
23	7	A student breaks his vow by performing funeral rites,
23	8	Excepting those of his mother and his father.
23	9	If a (student) is sick, he may eat, at his pleasure, all that is left by his teacher as medicine.
23	10	If (a student) who is employed by his teacher (to perform some duty), meets with his death, (the teacher) shall perform three Krikkhra penances.
23	11	If a student eats meat which has been given to him as leavings (by his teacher), he shall perform a Krikkhra penance of twelve days' duration, and afterwards finish his vow.
23	12	The same (penance must be performed) if he eats food given at a Srâddha or by a person who is impure on account of a recent death or birth.
23	13	It is declared in the Veda, than honey given without asking does not defile (a student) of the Vâgasaneyi-sâkhâ.
23	14	For him who committing suicide becomes An Abhisasta, his blood-relations (sapinda) shall not perform the funeral rites.
23	15	He is called a suicide who destroys himself by means of wood, water, clods of earth, stones, weapons, poison, or a rope.
23	16	Now they quote also (the following verse): 'The twice-born man who out of affection performs the last rites for a suicide, shall perform a Kândrâyana penance together with a Taptakrikkhra.'
23	17	We shall describe the Kândrâyana below.
23	18	A fast of three days (must be performed) for resolving to die by one's own hand.
23	19	'He who attempts suicide, but remains alive, shall perform a Krikkhra penance during twelve days. (Afterwards) he shall fast for three (days and) nights, being dressed constantly in a garment smeared (with clarified butter), and suppressing his breath, he shall thrice recite the Aghamarshana;'
23	20	Or, following the same rule, he may also frequently recite the Gâyatrî;
23	21	Or, having kindled a fire, he may offer clarified butter with the Kûshmândas.
23	22	'And the guilt (of) all (offences) excepting mortal sins is removed thereby.'
23	23	Now he may also sip water in the morning, thinking of (the Mantra), 'May fire and wrath and the lords of wrath protect me,' &c., and meditating on his sin; (then) he may mutter the Vyâhritis that end with satya (truth), prefixing (the syllable) Om (to each), or he may recite the Aghamarshana.
23	24	If he touches a human bone to which fat still adheres, he becomes impure during three (days and) nights;
23	25	But (on touching a bone) to which no fat adheres, a day and a night,
23	26	Likewise if he has followed a corpse (to the burial-ground).
23	27	If he passes between men reciting the Veda, he shall fast during a day and a night.
23	28	(Those who recite the Veda) shall sprinkle each other with water and stay away (from their houses) during three (days and) nights.
23	29	(The same penance must be performed) for a day and night, if a dog, a cat, or an ichneumon pass quickly (between those who recite the Veda).
23	30	If he has swallowed the flesh of a dog, a cock, a village pig, a grey heron, a vulture, a Bhâsa, a pigeon, a man, a crow or an owl, (he must) fast during seven days, (and thus) empty his entrails (afterwards he must) eat clarified butter, and be initiated again.
23	31	'But a Brâhmana who has been bitten by a dog, becomes pure, if he goes to a river that flows into the ocean, (bathes there), suppresses his breath one hundred times, and eats clarified butter.'
23	32	'Time, fire, purity of mind, water, looking at the sun, and ignorance (of defilement) are the six means by which created beings are purified.'
23	33	It is declared in the Veda that, on touching a dog, a Kândâla, or an outcast, he becomes at once pure, if he bathes, dressed in his clothes.
23	34	If (while reciting the Veda) they hear noisesmade by outcasts or Kândâlas, they shall sit silent and fasting during three days;
23	35	Or if they repeat that (text of the Gâyatrî) at least one thousand times, they become pure; thus it is stated in the Veda.
23	36	By this rule (the penance to be performed by) those who teach or sacrifice for vile men has been explained. It is declared in the Veda that they become pure by also relinquishing the fees (which they received).
23	37	By this same (rule the penance prescribed for) an Abhisasta, (one accused of a heinous crime,) has been explained.
23	38	(If he has been accused of) killing a learned Brâhmana, let him subsist during twelve days on water (only), and fast during (another) twelve days.
23	39	If he has falsely accused a Brâhmana of a crime which causes loss of caste, or of a minor offence which does not cause loss of caste, he shall subsist during a month on water (only), and constantly repeat the (Rikas called) Suddhavatîs;
23	40	Or he may go to bathe (with the priests) at (the conclusion of) a horse-sacrifice.
23	41	By this (rule the penance for) intercourse with a female of the Kândâla caste has been declared.
23	42	Now (follows the description of) another Krikkhra penance, applicable to all (men), where (the rule given above) has been altered.
23	43	On one day (let him eat) in the morning (only), on the (following) day at night (only), on the (next) day food given without asking, and on the (fourth) day (let him) fast; the succeeding (three) periods offour days (must be passed) in the same manner. Wishing to show favour to the Brâhmanas, Manu, the chief among the pillars of the law, has thus described the Sisukrikkhra (the hard penance of children) for infants, aged, and sick men.
23	44	Now follows the rule for (the performance of) the Kândrâyana (lunar penance).
23	45	On the first day of the dark half (of the month) let him eat fourteen (mouthfuls), let him diminish the (number of) mouthfuls (each day by one), and continue in this manner until the end of the fortnight. In like manner let him eat one mouthful on the first day of the bright half, and (daily) increasing  mouthfuls, continue until the end of the fortnight.
23	46	Meanwhile let him sing Sâmans, or mutter the Vyâhritis.
23	47	A month during which he thus performs a Kândrâyana, the Rishis have called by way of laudation, 'a means of purification' (pavitra). It is prescribed as an expiation of all (offences) for which no (special penance) has been mentioned.
24	1	Now (follows the description of) an Atikrikkhra penance.
24	2	Let him eat as much as he can take at one (mouthful, and follow the rules given) above for a Krikkhra, (viz.) to eat during three days in the morning, (during another three days) in the evening, (during further three days) food given withoutasking, and to fast during the last three days. That is an Atikrikkhra.
24	3	A Krikkhra penance (during the performance of which one) subsists on water (only is called) a Krikkhrâtikrikkhra.
24	4	The peculiar observances (prescribed during the performance) of Krikkhra penances (are as follows):
24	5	'Having cut his nails, (the performer) shall cause his beard and all his hair to be shaved off, excepting the eyebrows, the eyelashes, and the lock at the top of the head; (wear) one garment only; he shall eat blameless food; what one obtains by going to beg once (is called) blameless food; he shall bathe in the morning, at noon, and in the evening; he shall carry a stick (and) a waterpot; he shall avoid to speak to women and Sûdras; carefully keeping himself in an upright or sitting posture, he shall stand during the day, and remain seated during the night.' Thus speaks the divine Vasishtha.
24	6	Let him not instruct in these Institutes of the sacred law anybody but his son or a pupil who stays (in his house at least) for a year.
24	7	The fee (for teaching it) is one thousand (panas), (or) ten cows and a bull, or the worship of the teacher.
25	1	I will completely explain the purification of those whose guilt has not been made public, both from great crimes and for minor offences.
25	2	A penance prescribed in (the section on) secret (penances) is for an Agnihotrin, an aged and a learned man, who have subdued their senses; but other men (must perform the expiations) described above.
25	3	Those constantly engaged in suppressing their breath, reciting purificatory texts, giving gifts, making burnt-oblations, and muttering (sacred texts) will, undoubtedly, be freed from (the guilt of) crimes causing loss of caste.
25	4	Seated with Kusa grass in his hands, let him repeatedly suppress his breath, and again and again recite purificatory texts, the Vyâhritis, the syllable Om, and the daily portion of the Veda
25	5	Always intent on the practice of Yoga, let him again and again suppress his breath. Up to the ends of his hair and up to the ends of his nails let him perform highest austerity.
25	6	Through the obstruction (of the expiration) air is generated, through air fire is produced, then through heat water is formed; hence he is internally purified by (these) three.
25	7	Neither through severe austerities, nor through the daily recitation of the Veda, nor through offering sacrifices can the twice-born reach that condition which they attain by the practice of Yoga.
25	8	Through the practice of Yoga (true) knowledge is obtained, Yoga is the sum of the sacred law, the practice of Yoga is the highest and eternal austerity; therefore let him always be absorbed in the practice of Yoga.
25	9	For him who is constantly engaged in (reciting the syllable) Om, the seven Vyâhritis, and the three-footed Gâyatrî no danger exists anywhere.
25	10	The Vedas likewise begin with the syllable Om, and they end with the syllable Om, the syllable Om is the sum of all speech; therefore let him repeat it constantly.
25	11	The most excellent (portion of the) Veda, which consists of one syllable, is declared to be the best purificatory text.
25	12	If the guilt of all sins did fall on one man, to repeat the Gâyatrî ten thousand times (would be) an efficient means of purification.
25	13	If, suppressing his breath, he thrice recites the Gâyatrî together with the Vyâhritis together with the syllable Om and with the (text called) Siras, that is called one suppression of breath.
26	1	If, untired, he performs three suppressions of his breath according to the rule, the sins which he committed during a day and a night are instantly destroyed.
26	2	Seated during the evening prayer, he removes by (three) suppressions of his breath all guilt which he incurred during the day by deeds, thoughts, or speeches.
26	3	But standing during the morning prayer, he removes by (three) suppressions of his breath all guilt which he incurred during the night by deeds, thoughts, or speeches.
26	4	But sixteen suppressions of breath, accompanied by (the recitation of) the Vyâhritis and the syllable Om, repeated daily, purify after a month even the slayer of a learned Brâhmana.
26	5	Even a drinker of spirituous liquor becomes pure, if he mutters the (hymn seen) by Kutsa, 'Apa nah sosukad agham,' and (the hymn seen) by Vasishtha (which begins with the word) 'Prati,' the Mâhitra (hymn), and the Suddhavatîs.
26	6	Even he who has stolen gold becomes instantly free from guilt, if he once mutters (the hymn beginning with the words) 'Asya vâmasya' and the Sivasamkalpa.
26	7	The violator of a Guru's bed is freed (from sin) if he repeatedly recites the (hymn beginning) 'Havish pântam agaram' and that (beginning) 'Na tam amhah' and mutters the hymn addressed to Purusha.
26	8	Or plunging into water he may thrice mutter the Aghamarshana. Manu has declared that the (effect is the) same as if he had gone to bathe at a horse-sacrifice.
26	9	An offering consisting of muttered prayers is ten times more efficacious than a sacrifice at which animals are killed; a (prayer) which is inaudible (to others) surpasses it a hundred times, and the mental (recitation of sacred texts) one thousand times.
26	10	The four Pâkayagñas and those sacrifices which are enjoined by the rules of the Veda are all together not equal in value to the sixteenth part of a sacrifice consisting of muttered prayers.
26	11	But, undoubtedly, a Brâhmana reaches the highest goal by muttering prayers only; whether he perform other (rites) or neglect them, he is called a Brâhmana who befriends all creatures (maitra).
26	12	The sins of those who are intent on muttering prayers, of those who offer burnt-oblations, of those who are given to meditation, of those who reside in sacred places, and of those who have bathed after performing the vows called Siras, do not remain.
26	13	As a fire, fanned by wind, burns brighter, and (as its flame grows) through offerings (of butter), even so a Brâhmana who is daily engaged inmuttering sacred texts shines with a brilliant lustre.
26	14	The destruction of those who fulfil the duty of daily study, who constantly restrain themselves, who mutter prayers and offer sacrifices has never been known (to happen).
26	15	Let him who is desirous of purification repeat, though he be charged with all sins, the divine (Gâyatrî), at the most one thousand times, or one hundred times as a medium (penance), or at least ten times (for trivial faults).
26	16	A Kshatriya shall pass through misfortunes which have befallen him by the strength of his arms, a Vaisya and Sûdra by their wealth, the highest among twice-born men by muttered prayers and burnt-oblations.
26	17	As horses (are useless) without a chariot, as chariots (are useless) without horses, even so austerity (is useless) to him who is destitute of sacred learning, and sacred learning to him who practises no austerities.
26	18	As food mixed with honey, or honey mixed with food, even so are austerities and learning, joined together, a powerful medicine.
26	19	No guilt taints a Brâhmana who possesses learning, practises austerities, and daily mutters sacred texts, though he may constantly commit sinful acts.
27	1	If a hundred improper acts, and even more, have been committed, and the (knowledge of the) [paragraph continues] Veda is retained, the fire of the Veda destroys all (the guilt) of that man just as a (common) fire consumes fuel.
27	2	As a fire that burns strongly consumes even green trees, even so the fire of the Veda destroys one's guilt caused by (evil) deeds.
27	3	A Brâhmana who remembers the Rig-veda is not tainted by any guilt, though he has destroyed these (three) worlds and has eaten the food of all, (even of the most sinful) men.
27	4	If (a Brâhmana) relies on the power of the Veda, he cannot find pleasure in sinful acts. Guilt (incurred) through ignorance and negligence is destroyed, not (that of) other (intentional offences).
27	5	If a hermit subsisting on roots and fruit practises austerities in a forest, and (a householder) recites a single Rik, the merit of the acts of the one and of the other is equal.
27	6	Let him strengthen the Veda by (studying) the Itihâsas and Purânas. For the Veda fears a man of little learning, (thinking) 'He will destroy me.'
27	7	The daily recitation of the Veda and the performance, according to one's ability, of the series of Mahâyagñas quickly destroy guilt, even that of mortal sins.
27	8	Let him daily perform, without tiring, his particular rites which the Veda enjoins. For if he does that according to his ability, he will reach the most blessed state.
27	9	Through sacrificing for wicked people, through teaching them, through intermarrying with them, and through receiving gifts from them, (learned)[paragraph continues] Brâhmanas do not contract guilt, for (a learned Brâhmana) resembles a fire and the sun.
27	10	I will now declare the purification prescribed for (eating) food, regarding which doubts have arisen, whether it may be called fit to be eaten or not. Listen to my words!
27	11	Let a Brâhmana drink during three days the astringent decoction of the Brahmasuvarkalâ plant, unmixed with salt or pungent condiments, and (a decoction of) the Saṅkhapushpî plant, together with milk.
27	12	Let him drink water, after boiling in it Palâsa and Bilva leaves, Kusa grass, and (leaves of) lotuses and Udumbara trees; after three days and no more he becomes pure.
27	13	(Subsisting) during one day on each (of the following substances), cow's urine, cowdung, milk, sour milk, butter, and water in which Kusa grass has been boiled, and fasting on the seventh day purify even (him who fears that he has partaken of the food of) a Svapâka.
27	14	He who lives during five days on cow's urine, cowdung, milk, sour milk, and clarified butter, is purified by means of (that) Pañkagavya, (the five products of the cow.)
27	15	He who, in accordance with the rule, uses barley (for his food), becomes pure even by ocular proof. (For) if he is pure, those (barley grains) will be white, if he is impure they will be discoloured.
27	16	(If he makes) three morning meals of food fit for a sacrifice and three evening meals in like manner, and if food given without asking (is his subsistence) in the same manner, (he will thus perform) three fasts.
27	17	Now if he is in haste to make (himself pure), (let him) subsist on air during a day, and pass the night standing in water; (that penance) is equal to a Prâgâpatya (Krikkhra).
27	18	But if at sunrise he mutters the Gâyatrî eight thousand times, he will be freed from all mortal sins, provided he be not the slayer of a Brâhmana.
27	19	He, forsooth, who has stolen (the gold of a Brâhmana), has drunk spirituous liquor, has slain a learned Brâhmana, or has violated his Guru's bed, will become free from all (these) mortal sins if he studies the Institutes of the sacred law.
27	20	For unlawful acts, for unlawful sacrifices, and for great sins (let him perform) a Krikkhra and a Kândrâyana, which destroy all guilt.
27	21	Let him add daily one mouthful (to his food) during the bright (half of the month), let him diminish it (daily by one mouthful) during the dark (half), and let him fast on the new-moon day; that is the rule for the Kândrâyana (or lunar penance).
28	1	A woman is not defiled by a lover, nor a Brâhmana by Vedic rites, nor water by urine and ordure, nor fire by consuming (impure substances).
28	2-3	A wife, (though) tainted by sin, whether she be quarrelsome, or have left the house, or have suffered criminal force, or have fallen into the hands of thieves, must not be abandoned; to forsake her is not prescribed (by the sacred law). Let him wait for the time of her courses; by her temporary uncleanness she becomes pure.
28	4	Women (possess) an unequalled means of purification; they never become (entirely) foul. For month by month their temporary uncleanness removes their sins.
28	5	Women belong first to three gods, Soma (the moon), the Gandharva, and Fire, and come afterwards into the possession of men; according to the law they cannot be contaminated.
28	6	Soma gave them cleanliness, the Gandharva their melodious voice, and Fire purity of all (limbs); therefore women are free from stains.
28	7	Those versed in the sacred law state that there are three acts (only) which make women outcasts, (viz.) the murder of the husband, slaying a learned Brâhmana, and the destruction of the fruit of their womb.
28	8	A calf is pure when the milk flows, a bird when it causes fruit to fall, women during dalliance, and a dog when he catches a deer.
28	9	Pure is the mouth of a goat and of a horse, pure is the back of a cow, pure are the feet of a Brâhmana, but women are pure in all (limbs)
28	10	I will now declare the purificatory texts (which are found) in each Veda; by muttering them or reciting them at a burnt-oblation (men) are doubtlessly cleansed (from sin).
28	11	(They are) the Aghamarshana, the Devakrita, the Suddhavatîs, the Taratsamas, the Kûshmândas, the Pâvamânîs, and the Durgâsâvitri;
28	12	The Atîshaṅgas, the Padastobhas, and the Sâmans (called) Vyâhriti, the Bhârunda Sâmans, the Gâyatra (Sâman), and the Raivata;
28	13	The Purushavrata and the Bhâsa, and likewise the Devavrata (Sâmans), the Abliṅga, the Bârhaspatya, the hymn addressed to Vâk, likewise the Rikas (called) Madhu;
28	14	The Satarudriya, the Atharvasiras, the Trisuparna, the Mahâvrata, the Gosûkta, and the Asvasûkta, and the two Sâmans (called) Suddhâsuddhîya.
28	15	The three (Sâmans called) Âgyadohas, the Rathantara, the Agnervrata, the Vâmadevya, and the Brihat, being muttered, purify (all) living beings. (He who sings them) may obtain the recollection of former existences, if he desires it.
28	16	Gold is the firstborn of Fire, through Vishnu exists the earth, and the cows are children of the[paragraph continues] Sun; he who bestows as gifts gold, a cow, and land will obtain rewards without end for them.
28	17	A cow, a horse, gold, (and) land, bestowed on an unlearned Brâhmana who neglects his sacred duties, prevent the giver (from attaining heaven).
28	18-19	(If he presents), on the full moon of the month of Vaisâkha, (to) seven or five Brâhmanas, black or white sesamum grains (mixed) with honey, (saying), 'May the king of justice (Yama) rejoice!' or (expressing) some other (wish) which he may have in his mind, the guilt which he has incurred during his (whole) life will instantly vanish.
28	20	But hear (now) the reward of the merit acquired by that man who gives the skin of a black antelope, to which the hoofs are (still) attached and the navel of which is adorned with gold, covering it with sesamum grains.
28	21	'Without doubt he has bestowed (through that gift) the four-faced earth, together with its caves filled with gold, and together with its mountains, groves, and forests.'
28	22	He who, placing on the skin of a black antelope, sesamum, gold, honey, and butter, gives it to a Brâhmana, overcomes all sin.'
29	1	Through liberality (man) obtains all his desires,
29	2	(Even) longevity, (and he is born again as) a student of the Veda, possessed of beauty.
29	3	He who abstains from injuring (sentient beings) obtains heaven.
29	4	By entering a fire the world of Brahman (is gained).
29	5	By (a vow of) silence (he obtains) happiness.
29	6	By staying (constantly) in water he becomes a lord of elephants.
29	7	He who expends his hoard (in gifts) becomes free from disease.
29	8	A giver of water (becomes) rich by (the fulfilment of) all his desires.
29	9	A giver of food (will have) beautiful eyes and a good memory.
29	10	He who gives a promise to protect (somebody) from all dangers (becomes) wise.
29	11	(To bestow gifts) for the use of cows (is equal to) bathing at all sacred places.
29	12	By giving a couch and a seat (the giver becomes) master of a harem.
29	13	By giving an umbrella (the giver) obtains a house.
29	14	He who gives a house obtains a town.
29	15	He who gives a pair of shoes obtains a vehicle.
29	16	Now they quote also (the following verses): Whatever sin a man distressed for livelihood commits, (from that) he is purified by giving land, (be it) even "a bull's hide."'
29	17	'He who gives to a Brâhmana a vessel filled with water for sipping, will obtain after death complete freedom from thirst and be born again as a drinker of Soma.'
29	18	'If a gift of one thousand oxen fit to draw a carriage (has been bestowed) according to the rule on a perfectly worthy man, that is equal to giving a maiden.'
29	19	'They declare that cows, land, and learning are the three most excellent gifts. For to give learning is (to bestow) the greatest of all gifts, and it surpasses those (other gifts).'
29	20	'A learned man who, free from envy, follows this rule of conduct which procures endless rewards, and which through final liberation frees him from transmigration;'
29	21	'Or who, full of faith, pure, and subduing hissenses, remembers or even hears it, will, freed from all sin, be exalted in the highest heaven.'
30	1	Practise righteousness, not unrighteousness; speak truth, not untruth; look far, not near; look towards the Highest, not towards that which is not the Highest.
30	2	A Brâhmana is a fire.
30	3	For the Veda (says), 'Agni, forsooth, is a Brâhmana.'
30	4	And how is that?
30	5	And it is also declared in the Kâthaka, 'On that (occasion) the body of the Brâhmana who represents the sacrificial seat is the altar, the vow to perform the rite is the sacrifice, the soul is the animal to be slain, the intellect the rope (with which the animal is bound), the mouth of (the Brâhmana) who represents the seat is the Âhavanîya fire, in his navel (is the Dakshinâ fire), the fire in his abdomen is the Gârhapatya fire, the Prâna is the Adhvaryu priest, the Apâna, the Hotri priest, the Vyâna the Brahman, the Samâna the Udgâtri priest, the organs of sensation the sacrificial vessels. He who knowing this offers a sacrifice to the organs through the organs.' . . .
30	6	Now they quote also (the following verses): 'An offering placed in the mouth-fire of a Brâhmanawhich is rich in Veda-fuel, protects and saves the giver and (the eater) himself from sin.'
30	7	'But the offering made through the mouth of a Brâhmana, which is neither spilt nor causes pain (to sentient creatures), nor assails him (who makes it), is far more excellent than an Agnihotra.'
30	8	After performing a mental sacrifice at which meditation (takes the place of the sacred) fire, truthfulness (the place of) the sacred fuel, patience (the place of) the oblation, modesty (the place of) the sacrificial spoon, abstention from injuring living beings (the place of the) sacrificial cake, contentment (the place of) the sacrificial post, (and a promise of) safety given to all beings which is hard to keep (the place of) the reward given to the priests, a wise man goes to his (eternal) home.
30	9	The hair of an aging man shows signs of age, (and) the teeth of an aging man show signs of age, (but) the desire to live and the desire for wealth do not decay even in an aging man.
30	10	Happiness (is the portion) of that man who relinquishes (all) desire, which fools give up with difficulty, which does not diminish with age, and which is a life-long disease.
30	11	Adoration to Vasishtha Satayâtu, the son of Mitra and Varuna and Urvasî!
