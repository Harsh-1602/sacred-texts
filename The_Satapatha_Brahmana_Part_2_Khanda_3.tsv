1	1	1	They choose a place of worship. Let them choose (the place) which lies highest, and above which no other part of the ground rises ; for it was from thence that the gods ascended to heaven, and he who is consecrated indeed ascends to the gods. He thus sacrifices on a place of worship frequented by the gods; but were any other part of the ground to rise above it, he would indeed be lowered while sacrificing: let them therefore choose (the place) which lies highest.
1	1	2	While being high, that place should be even; and being even, it should be firm; and being firm, it should incline towards the east, since the east is the quarter of the gods; or else it should inclinetowards the north, since the north is the quarter of men. It should rise somewhat towards the south, that being the quarter of the Fathers. Were it to incline towards the south, the sacrifice would quickly go to yonder world; but in this way the sacrificer lives long: let it therefore rise somewhat towards the south.
1	1	3	Let not the measure of the sacrificial ground be exceeded on the east side, since such an excess would be in favour of his spiteful enemy. It may be so in the south, and also in the north; but that place of worship alone is thoroughly efficient where the measure of the sacrificial ground is exceeded in the west; for to him (who possesses such a one) the higher  worship of the gods readily inclines. So much as to the place of worship.
1	1	4	Now Yâgñavalkya spake,--'We went to choose a place of worship for Vârshnya . Sâtyayagña then said, "Verily, this whole earth is divine: on whatever part thereof one may sacrifice (for anyone), after enclosing (and consecrating) it with a sacrificial formula, there is a place of worship."
1	1	5	'It is, however, the officiating priests that constitute the place (or medium) of worship: wheresoever wise and learned Brâhmans, versed in sacred lore, perform the sacrifice, there no failure takes place: that (place of worship) we consider the nearest (to the gods) .'
1	1	6	On this (ground) they erect either a hall or a shed, with the top-beams running from west to east ; for the east is the quarter of the gods, and from the east westwards the gods approach men: that is why one offers to them while standing with his face towards the east.
1	1	7	For this reason one mug not sleep with hishead towards the west, lest he should sleep stretching (his legs) towards the gods. The southern quarter belongs to the Fathers; and the western one to the snakes; and that faultless one is the one where the gods ascended (to heaven); and the northern quarter belongs to men. Hence in human (practice) a hall or shed is constructed with the top-beams running from south to north, because the north is the quarter of men. It is only for a consecrated, not for an unconsecrated person that it is (constructed) with the top-beams running from west to east.
1	1	8	They enclose it on every side, lest it should rain upon (the sacrificer, while being consecrated): this, at least, is (the reason for doing so in) the rainy season . He who is consecrated, truly draws nigh to the gods, and becomes one of the deities. Now the gods are secreted from men, and secret also is what is enclosed on every side: this is why they enclose it on every side.
1	1	9	Not every one may enter it, but only a Brahman, or a Râganya, or a Vaisya, for these are able to sacrifice.
1	1	10	Let him not commune with every one; for he who is consecrated draws nigh to the gods, and becomes one of the deities. Now the gods do not commune with every one, but only with a Brahman, or a. Râganya, or a Vaisya; for these are able to sacrifice. Should there be occasion for him to converse with a Sûdra, let him say to one of those, 'Tell this one so and so! tell this one so and so!'This is the rule of conduct for the consecrated in such a case.
1	1	11	In the first place, having taken the two churning-sticks in his hand, he approves of the hall. Taking hold of the chief post of the front (east) side, he pronounces this sacrificial formula , 'We have come to this place of worship on earth, wherein all the gods delighted.' Thereby that (place of worship) of his becomes acceptable to all the gods, as well as to the learned Brâhmans versed in sacred lore; and that (place of worship) of his, which those Brâhmans versed in sacred lore see with their eyes, becomes acceptable to them.
1	1	12	And when he says, 'Wherein all the gods delighted,' thereby it becomes acceptable for him to all the gods. Crossing over by means of the rik and sâman, and by the yagus;' by means of the rik and sâman, and the yagus, indeed, they reach the end of the sacrifice: 'May I reach the end of the sacrifice!' he thereby says. 'May we rejoice in increase of substance and in sap!' Increase of substance doubtless means abundance, and abundance means prosperity: he. thereby invokes a blessing. 'May we rejoice in sap,' he says, because people say of one who enjoys prosperity and attains to the highest distinction, that 'he rejoices in sap;' therefore he says, 'May we rejoice in sap!'
1	2	1	Let him perform the rite of consecration (dîkshâ)  in the afternoon. Previously to the shavingof his hair and beard he may eat of what he likes, or whatever comes to hand; for hereafter his food consists of fast-milk (vrata) only. But, if he does not care to eat, he need not eat anything.
1	2	2	Thereupon they enclose a place  north of the hall, and place a vessel of water in it. Beside this the barber takes up his position. He (the sacrificer) then shaves his hair and beard, and cuts his nails. For impure, indeed, is that part of man where water does not reach him. Now at the hair and beard, and at the nails the water does not reach him: hence when he shaves his hair and beard, and cuts his nails, he does so in order that he may be consecrated after becoming pure.
1	2	3	Now some shave themselves all over, in order that they may be consecrated after becoming pure all over; but let him not do this. For even by shaving the hair of his head and his beard, and by cutting his nails, he becomes pure: let him therefore shave only the hair of his head and his beard, and cut his nails.
1	2	4	In the first place he cuts his nails, first of the right hand--for in human (practice) those of the left hand (are cut) first, but with the gods in this manner. First (he cuts those) of the thumbs--for in human (practice) those of the little fingers (are cut) first, but with the gods in this manner.
1	2	5	He first passes (the comb) through his right whisker--for in human (practice they comb) first the left whisker, but with the gods in this manner.
1	2	6	His right whisker he moistens first, with the text, 'May these divine waters be propitiousunto me! The reason why he says, 'May these divine waters be propitious unto me,' is this: the waters are a thunderbolt, for the waters are indeed a thunderbolt; hence wherever these waters flow they produce a hollow, and whatever they come near that they destroy (lit. burn up). Hereby, then, he appeases that same thunderbolt; and thus appeased, that thunderbolt does not injure him. This is why he says, 'May these divine waters be propitious unto me!'
1	2	7	Thereupon he lays a stalk of sacrificial grass on (the hair of the whisker), with the text, 'O plant, protect me!' For the razor is a thunderbolt, and thus that thunderbolt, the razor, does not injure him. Thereto he applies the razor, with the text, 'O knife, injure him not!' for the razor is a thunderbolt, and thus that thunderbolt, the razor, does not injure him.
1	2	8	Having cut off (part of the stalk and hair), he throws it into the vessel of water. Silently he moistens the left whisker; silently he lays the stalk of grass on it; and having silently applied the razor thereto and cut through (it and the hair), he throws them into the vessel of water.
1	2	9	He then hands the razor to the barber, and the latter shaves off the hair and beard. When he has shaved the hair and beard ,--
1	2	10	He bathes. For impure, indeed, is man: he is foul  within, in that he speaks untruth;--and water is pure: he thinks, 'May I be consecrated, after becoming pure;'--and water is cleansing: he thinks, 'May I become consecrated after being cleansed!' This is the reason why he bathes.
1	2	11	He bathes, with the text , 'May the waters, the mothers, cleanse us!' whereby he says, 'May they cleanse !' 'May the purifiers of ghee purify us with (heavenly) ghee!' For he, indeed, is thoroughly purified whom they have purified with ghee : accordingly he says, 'May the purifiers of ghee purify us with ghee!'--'For they, the divine, take away all taint;' now 'all' means 'every,' and 'taint' means what is impure; for they do take away from him every impurity: therefore he says, 'For they, the divine, take away all taint.'
1	2	12	He steps out (from the water) towards the north-east , with the text, 'Cleansed and pure[paragraph continues] I go forth from them;' for cleansed and pure he indeed goes forth from them.
1	2	13	He then puts on a (linen) garment, for completeness’ sake: it is indeed his own skin he thereby puts on himself. Now that same skin which belongs to the cow was originally on man.
1	2	14	The gods spake, 'Verily, the cow supports everything here (on earth); come, let us put on the cow that skin which is now on man: therewith she will be able to endure rain and cold and heat.'
1	2	15	Accordingly, having flayed man, they put that skin on the cow, and therewith she now endures rain and cold and heat.
1	2	16	For man was indeed flayed; and hence where-ever a stalk of grass or some other object cuts him, the blood trickles out. They then put that skin, the garment, on him; and for this reason none but man wears a garment, it having been put on him as his skin. Hence also one should take care to be properly clad, so that he may be completely endued with his own skin. Hence also people like to see even an ugly person properly clad, since he is endued with his own skin.
1	2	17	Let him, then, not be naked in the presence of a cow. For the cow knows that she wears his skin, and runs away for fear lest he should take the skin from her. Hence also cows draw fondly near to one who is properly clad.
1	2	18	Now the woof of this cloth belongs to Agni, and the warp to Vâyu , the thrum to the Fathers,the fore-edge  to the snakes, the threads to the All-gods, and the meshes to the asterisms. For thus indeed all the deities are concerned therein; and hence it is the garment of the consecrated.
1	2	19	Let it (if possible) be a new one , for the sake of unimpaired vigour. Let him (the Adhvaryu) tell (the Pratiprasthâtri) to beat it, in order that whatsoever part of it an unclean woman has spun or woven may become clean. And if it be a new one, let him sprinkle it with water, so that it become clean. Or let him be consecrated in one which is laid aside to be worn (daily) after bathing, without being soaked (in some sharp cleansing substance) .
1	2	20	He puts it round him, with the text, 'Thou art the covering  of consecration and penance;' heretofore, indeed, this was the covering of him as one unconsecrated, but now it is that of consecration and penance: hence he says, 'thou art the covering of consecration and penance.' 'I put thee on, the kindly and auspicious;' whereby he means to say, 'I put thee on, the kindly and pleasing one;'--[paragraph continues] 'fostering a fair appearance;' for evil indeed is that appearance which he has heretofore fostered while unconsecrated; but now (he fosters) a fair appearance: therefore he says, 'fostering a fair appearance.'
1	2	21	He (the Adhvaryu) then makes him enter the hall. Let him not eat (the flesh) of either the cow or the ox; for the cow and the ox doubtless support everything here on earth. The gods spake, 'Verily, the cow and the ox support everything here: come, let us bestow on the cow and the ox whatever vigour belongs to other species !' Accordingly they bestowed on the cow and the ox whatever vigour belonged to other species (of animals); and therefore the cow and the ox eat most. Hence, were one to eat (the flesh) of an ox or a cow, there would be, as it were, an eating of everything, or, as it were, a going on to the end (or, to destruction). Such a one indeed would be likely to be born (again) as a strange being, (as one of whom there is) evil report, such as 'he has expelled an embryo from a woman,' 'he has committed a sin ;' let him therefore not eat (the flesh) of the cow and the ox. Nevertheless Yâgñavalkya said, 'I, for one, eat it, provided that it is tender.'
1	3	1	Having brought water forward , he takes out (the material for) a cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Vishnu; for Agni is all the deities, since it is in Agni that offering is made to all the deities. Moreover Agni is the lower half, and Vishnu is the upper half of the sacrifice: 'I will become consecrated after encompassing all the deities, after encompassing the entire sacrifice,' thus he thinks, and hence there is a cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Vishnu.
1	3	2	Some then offer a rice-pap to the Âdityas. This is referred to , 'There are eight sons of Aditi who were born from her body; with seven she went to the gods, but Mârtânda  she cast off.'
1	3	3	Now Aditi had eight sons. But those that are called 'the gods, sons of Aditi,' were only seven, for the eighth, Mârtânda, she brought forth unformed : it was a mere lump of bodily matter , as broad as it was high. Some, however, say that he was of the size of a man.
1	3	4	The gods, sons of Aditi, then spake, 'Thatwhich was born after us  must not be lost: come, let us fashion it.' They accordingly fashioned it as this man is fashioned. The flesh which was cut off him, and thrown down in a lump, became the elephant: hence they say that one must not accept an elephant (as a gift) , since the elephant has sprung from man. Now he whom they thus fashioned was Vivasvat, the Âditya (or the sun); and of him (came) these creatures.
1	3	5	He spake, 'Among my offspring he shall be successful who shall offer that rice-pap to the Âdityas.' Accordingly he alone succeeds who offers that rice-pap to the Âdityas. Only that (cake) to Agni and Vishnu is, however, generally approved.
1	3	6	There are seventeen kindling-verses for it . In a low voice he offers to the two deities. There are five fore-offerings and three after-offerings. For the sake of completeness they perform the patnîsamyâgas ; but he offers no samishtayagus, lest, having put on that garment of the consecrated, he should reach the end of the sacrifice before its completion; for the samishtayagus is the end of the sacrifice.
1	3	7	He (the sacrificer) then gets himself anointed (with fresh butter), while standing east of the hall. For, having been flayed, man is sore; and by getting himself anointed, he becomes healed of his soreness: for man's skin is on the cow, and that fresh butteralso comes from the cow. He (the Adhvaryu) thus supplies him with his own skin, and for this reason he gets himself anointed.
1	3	8	It is fresh butter,--for melted butter (ghee) belongs to the gods, and creamy butter  to men. Here, on the other hand, it is neither ghee nor creamy butter; it should rather be both ghee and creamy butter, for the sake of unimpaired vigour: by means of that which is of unimpaired vigour he accordingly makes him of unimpaired vigour.
1	3	9	He anoints him from the head down to the feet in accordance with the tendency of the hair, with the text , 'Thou art the sap of the great ones.' The 'great ones,' doubtless, is one of the names of those cows, and their sap indeed it is: therefore he says, 'thou art the sap of the great ones.' 'Thou art life-giving: give me light!' There is nothing obscure in this.
1	3	10	Thereupon he anoints the eyes. 'Sore, indeed, is the eye of man; mine is sound,' so spake Yâgñavalkya. Dim-eyed, indeed, he was (heretofore); and the secretion of his eyes was matter. He now makes his eyes sound by anointing them.
1	3	11	Now, when the gods slew the Asura-Rakshas, Sushna , the Dânava, falling backward entered into the eyes of men: he is that pupil of the eye, andlooks like a young lad . Against him he (the sacrificer), now that he enters on the sacrifice, raises a rampart of stone all round himself, for the ointment is (produced from) stone.
1	3	12	It is such as comes from mount Trikakud; for when Indra slew Vritra he transformed that eye of his (Vritra's) into the mount Trikakud . The reason, then, why (ointment) from mount Trikakud (is used), is that he thereby puts eye into eye. Should he be unable to obtain any Traikakuda ointment, any other than Traikakuda may be used; for one and the same, indeed, is the significance of the ointment.
1	3	13	He anoints (the eyes) with a reed-stalk, for the reed is a thunderbolt. It is one with a tuft, in order to chase away the evil spirits . For rootless,indeed, and unfettered on both sides, the Rakshas roams along the air; even as man here roams along the air , rootless and unfettered on both sides: the reason, then, why it is (a reed-stalk) with a tuft, is to chase away the evil spirits.
1	3	14	The right eye he anoints first; for in human practice the left (eye is anointed) first, but with the gods (it is done) thus.
1	3	15	He anoints it with the text, 'Thou art the eye-ball of Vritra,'--for Vritra's eye-ball it indeed is;--'Eye-giving thou art: give me the eye!' in this there is nothing obscure.
1	3	16	The right eye he anoints once with the sacrificial formula, once silently; and the left one he anoints once with the formula, twice silently: thus he makes the left (or upper) one superior .
1	3	17	And the reason why he anoints five times, is that the sacrifice is of equal measure with the year, and five seasons there are in the year: he thus obtains possession of the latter in five (divisions), and therefore he anoints five times.
1	3	18	He then purifies him with a cleanser (pavitra, strainer) of sacred grass; for impure, indeed, is man:--he is foul within in that he speaks untruth;--and sacred grass is pure: 'Having become pure, I shall be consecrated,' thus he thinks;--and the stalks of sacred grass are a means of cleansing,--[paragraph continues] 'Having become cleansed, I shall be consecrated,' thus he thinks; and therefore he purifies him with a cleanser of sacred grass.
1	3	19	It may consist of one (stalk of grass); for that blower (or purifier, the Wind) is one only, and in accordance with his nature is this (cleanser): hence it may consist of one (stalk).
1	3	20	Or there may be three (stalks); for one, indeed, is that blower, but on entering into man he becomes threefold, to wit, the out-breathing, the in-breathing, and the through-breathing , and in accordance with his measure is this (cleanser): hence there may be three (stalks).
1	3	21	Or there may be seven (stalks ); for there are seven vital airs of the head: hence there may be seven (stalks). There may even be thrice seven,--one and twenty: such indeed is perfection.
1	3	22	He purifies him with seven (stalks) each time, with the text , 'May the Lord of thought purify me!' The lord of thought doubtless is Pragâpati : he thereby means to say, 'May Pragâpati purify me!' 'May the lord of speech purify me!' The lord of speech doubtless is Pragâpati : he thereby means to say, 'May Pragâpati purify me!' 'May the divine Savitri purify me,'--for well purified indeed is he whom the divine[paragraph continues] Savitri has purified ; therefore he says, 'May the divine Savitri purify me!'--'with a flawless cleanser;' for that blower (the wind) is indeed a flawless cleanser: 'with that one,' he means to say; 'with the rays of the sun;' for they, the rays of the sun, are indeed purifiers; therefore he says, 'with the rays of the sun.'
1	3	23	'O Lord of the pavitra' (means of purification),--for he (who is consecrated) is indeed the lord of the pavitra,--'of thee, purified by the pavitra,--for he is indeed purified by the pavitra;--'with whatsoever desire I purify myself, may I be able to effect it!' whereby he says, 'May I reach the end of the sacrifice!'
1	3	24	He then makes him pronounce the beginning of the benedictions , 'We approach you, O gods, for desirable goods, at the opening of the sacrifice; we call on you, O gods, for holy  blessings.' Thereby the officiating priests invoke on him those blessings which are their own.
1	3	25	He (the sacrificer) then bends his fingers inwards, viz. the two (little fingers), with the text , 'Hail, from the mind (I take hold of) the sacrifice!'--the two (nameless or ring fingers) with, 'Hail, from the wide ether!'--the two (middle fingers) with, 'Hail, from the sky and earth!'--with, 'Hail, from the wind, I take hold (of the sacrifice)!' he clenches both fists . Not visiblyindeed is the sacrifice to be taken hold of, as is either this staff or the garment,--but invisible indeed are the gods, invisible is the sacrifice.
1	3	26	Now when he says, 'Hail, from the mind (I take hold of) the sacrifice,' he takes hold of it from the mind;--in saying, 'From the wide ether,' he takes hold of it from the ether;--in saying, 'From heaven and earth,' he takes hold of it from those two, heaven and earth, on which this entire universe rests;--and in saying, 'From the wind I take hold of (the sacrifice)'--the wind being the sacrifice--he takes hold of the sacrifice directly.
1	3	27	And when he calls, 'Hail! Hail !'--the 'Svâhâ' being the sacrifice--he thereby appropriates the sacrifice. Here now he restrains his speech; the sacrifice being speech: he thereby appropriates  the sacrifice.
1	3	28	He (the Adhvaryu) then makes him enter the hall. He walks along the back of the Âhavanîya and the front of the Gârhapatya ,--this is his passage until the Soma pressing. The reason why this is his passage until the Soma pressing is this. The fire is the womb of the sacrifice, and the consecrated is an embryo; and the embryo moves aboutwithin the womb. And since he (the sacrificer) moves about there (between the fires), and now turns round and now back, therefore these embryos move about, and now turn round and now back. Hence this is his passage till the Soma pressing.
1	4	1	All formulas of the consecration are audgrabhana (elevatory), since he who is consecrated elevates himself (ud-grabh) from this world to the world of the gods. He elevates himself by means of these same formulas, and therefore they say that all formulas of the consecration are 'audgrabhana.' Now they also (specially) designate these intermediate ones as 'audgrabhana,' because these are libations , and a libation is a sacrifice. For the muttering of a sacrificial formula is an occult (form of sacrifice), but a libation is a direct (form of) sacrifice: hence it is by this same sacrifice that he elevates himself from this world to the world of the gods.
1	4	2	And again, the three libations which he makes with the dipping-spoon (sruva) are said to be 'âdhîtayagus .' The fourth libation is made for the sake of completeness; while the fifth, which is made with the offering-spoon (sruk, viz. the guhû), is the real audgrabhana-libation: for he makes it with ananushtubh verse, and the anushtubh is speech, and the sacrifice also is speech.
1	4	3	By means of the sacrifice the gods obtained that supreme authority which they now wield. They spake, 'How may this (world) of ours be unattainable by men!' They then sipped the sap of the sacrifice, as bees would suck out honey; and having drained the sacrifice and effaced its traces by means of the sacrificial stake, they disappeared: and because they effaced (scattered, yopaya) therewith, therefore it is called yûpa (stake).
1	4	4	Now this was heard by the Rishis. They collected the sacrifice, just as this sacrifice is collected (prepared) ; for even so does he now collect the sacrifice, when he offers those (audgrabhana) libations.
1	4	5	He offers five libations, because the sacrifice is commensurate to the year, and there are five seasons in the year: thus he gains it (the year) in five (divisions), and therefore he makes five libations.
1	4	6	Now then of the oblation : 'To the Purpose, to the Impulse, to Agni, hail!' At the outset he indeed purposes to sacrifice. What part of the sacrifice (is contained) in this (first libation), that he now collects and makes his own.
1	4	7	'To Wisdom, to Thought, to Agni, hail!' with wisdom and thought he indeed conceives that he may sacrifice. What part of the sacrifice (is contained) in this (second libation), that he now collects and makes his own.
1	4	8	'To Initiation, to Penance, to Agni, hail!' This is merely uttered, but no libation is made.
1	4	9	'To Sarasvatî, to Pûshan, to Agni, hail!' Now Sarasvatî is speech, and the sacrifice also is speech. And Pûshan represents cattle, because Pûshan means prosperity (pushti), and cattle also means prosperity, since the sacrifice means cattle. What part of the sacrifice (is contained) in this (third libation), that he now collects and makes his own.
1	4	10	As to this they say, 'These (three) libations are offered indefinitely; they are unestablished, without a god: therein is neither Indra, nor Soma, nor Agni.'
1	4	11	'To the Purpose, to the Impulse, to Agni, hail!'--not any one (god we obtain) from this ! But Agni surely is definite, Agni is established: when he offers in Agni (the fire), surely those (libations) are thereby made definite, are thereby established: for this reason he offers at all libations with, 'To Agni, hail!' Moreover, these libations are called 'âdhîtayagûmshi.'
1	4	12	'To the Purpose, to the Impulse, to Agni, hail!' he says; for by his own mind he purposes to sacrifice, and from his own mind he impels it (the sacrifice) when he performs it: these two deities the Purpose and the Impulse--are meditated upon (âdhîta) in his mind.
1	4	13	'To Wisdom, to Thought, to Agni, hail!' he says; for with wisdom and thought he indeed conceives that he may sacrifice: these two deities--[paragraph continues] Wisdom and Thought--are meditated upon in his mind.
1	4	14	'To Sarasvatî, to Pûshan, to Agni, hail!' he says; for Sarasvatî is speech, and the sacrifice also is speech: this deity--Speech--is meditated upon in his mind. Pûshan, on the other hand, means cattle, for Pûshan means prosperity (pushti), and cattle means prosperity, since the sacrifice means cattle: hence cattle-are meditated upon in his mind. And because these deities are meditated upon (â-dhîta) in his mind, therefore (these libations) are called âdhîtayagûmshi.
1	4	15	He then offers the fourth libation, with the text, 'Ye divine, vast, all-soothing Waters! Heaven and Earth, wide Ether! let us render homage unto Brihaspati with offering, hail!' This (libation) truly is nearer to the sacrifice, since he praises the waters, and water is sacrifice. 'Heaven and Earth! wide Ether!' he says, because he thereby praises the worlds. 'Let us render homage unto Brihaspati, with offering, hail!' he says; for Brihaspati is the Brahman, and the sacrifice also is the Brahman: for this reason also this (libation) is nearer to the sacrifice.
1	4	16	But the fifth libation which he makes with the offering-spoon (sruk), doubtless is the veritable sacrifice; for he offers it with an anushtubh (verse), and the anushtubh is speech and so is the sacrifice.
1	4	17	In the first place he pours the butter, which remains in the dhruvâ, into the guhû. He then ladles with the sruva three times butter from the melting-pot into the guhû: with what he takes the third time he fills the sruva .
1	4	18	He offers, with the text , 'May every mortal espouse the friendship of the divine guide! every one prayeth for wealth: let him choose glory, that he may prosper, hail!'
1	4	19	Now this (verse and libation) consists of five parts in respect of deities : 'visvo devasya' refers to the Visve Devâh; 'netur' to Savitri; 'marto vurîta' to Mitra; 'dyumnam vrinîta' to Brihaspati, since Brihaspati means dyumna (glory); and 'pushyase' (for prospering) refers to Pûshan.
1	4	20	This (libation), then, consists of five parts, in respect of deities;--fivefold is the sacrifice, fivefold the animal victim, and five seasons there are in the year: the latter he accordingly gains by this (libation) consisting of five parts in respect of deities.
1	4	21	He offers this libation with an anushtubh verse, because the anushtubh is speech, and the sacrifice is speech; so that he thereby obtains the real sacrifice.
1	4	22	As to this they say, 'Let him offer only this one: for whatever object the others are offered, that object he gains even by this one.' And, indeed , ifhe offers only this one, he would offer a full-offering; and the full means everything: hence he gains everything by this (oblation). And by filling the dipping-spoon (sruva), he fills the offering-spoon (guhû), and the latter he offers full. This, however, is a mere statement (of others’ views) , but all (five) libations are offered.
1	4	23	He offers this one with an anushtubh verse. Being an anushtubh verse, it consists of thirty-one syllables. Now there are ten fingers, ten toes, ten vital airs, and the thirty-first is the body wherein those vital airs are contained; for this much constitutes man, and the sacrifice is a man, the sacrifice is of the same proportion as a man . Thus, whatever the extent of the sacrifice, whatever its measure, to that extent he takes possession of it by means of this (libation), when he offers it with an anushtubh verse of thirty-one syllables.
2	1	1	South of the Âhavanîya he spreads two black antelope skins on the ground, with the neck parts towards the east: thereon he consecrates him. If there are two (skins), they are an image of these two worlds (heaven and earth), and thus he consecrates him on these two worlds.
2	1	2	They are joined (fitted) together along their edge , for these two worlds are also, as it were, joined together at their edge. At the hind part they are fastened together through holes: thus, after uniting (mithunîkritya) these two worlds, he consecrates him thereon.
2	1	3	But if there be only one (skin), then it is an image of these (three) worlds; then he consecrates him on these (three) worlds. Those (hairs) which are white are an image of the sky; those which are black are (an image) of this (earth);--or, if he likes, conversely: those which are black are an image of the sky, and those which are white are (an image) of this (earth). Those which are of a brownish yellow colour , are an image of the atmosphere. Thus he consecrates him on these (three) worlds.
2	1	4	And let him, in that case, turn in the hind end (of the skin) : thus, after uniting these worlds with each other, he consecrates him thereon.
2	1	5	He then squats down behind the two skins, with his face towards the east and with bent (right) knee; and while touching them thus  at a placewhere the white and black (hair) join, he mutters , 'Ye are the images of the Rik and Sâman;'--an image doubtless is what is conformable : 'Ye are conformable to, the riks and sâmans' he thereby means to say.
2	1	6	'I touch you.' Now, he who is consecrated becomes an embryo, and enters into the metres: hence he has his hands closed, since embryos have their hands closed.
2	1	7	And when he says, 'I touch you,' he means to say, 'I enter into you.' 'Do ye guard me up to the goal of this sacrifice!' whereby he says, 'Do ye protect me until the completion of this sacrifice!'
2	1	8	He then kneels down with his right knee (on the skin), with the text, 'Thou art a refuge: afford me refuge!' for the skin (karma) of the black deer it is indeed among men, but among the gods it is a refuge (sarma): therefore he says, 'Thou art a refuge: afford me refuge.' 'Homage be to thee: injure me not!' Now he who raises himself upon the sacrifice  doubtless raises himself to one that is his better; for the black deer skin is a (means of) sacrifice. Hereby, now, he propitiates that sacrifice, and thus that sacrifice does not injure him: for this reason he says, 'Homage be to thee: injure me not!'
2	1	9	He must indeed sit down first on the hind part (of the skin). Were he, on the other hand, to sit down at once in the middle (of the skin), and wereany one there to curse him, saying, 'He shall either become demented or fall down headlong!' then that would indeed come to pass. Let him therefore first sit down on the hind part (of the skin).
2	1	10	He then girds himself with the zone. For once upon a time when the Aṅgiras were consecrated, they were seized with weakness, for they had prepared no other food but fast-milk. They then perceived this (source of) strength (viz. the zone), and this (source of) strength they put in (or round) the middle of their body as a (means of attaining) completion: and thereby they attained completion. And so does he now put that (source of) strength in the middle of his body and thereby attain completion.
2	1	11	It is made of hemp. Hempen it is in order to be soft. Now when Pragâpati, having become an embryo, sprung forth from that sacrifice, that which was nearest to him, the amnion, became hempen threads: hence they smell putrid. And that which was the outer membrane (and placenta) became the garment of the consecrated. Now the amnion lies under the outer membrane, and hence that (zone) is worn under the garment. And in like manner as Pragâpati, having become an embryo, sprung forth from that sacrifice, so does he become an embryo and spring forth from that sacrifice.
2	1	12	It (the cord) is a triple one, because food is threefold, food being cattle. (Moreover) the father and mother (are two), and that which is born is a third: hence it is a triple (cord).
2	1	13	It is intertwined with a shoot of reed (muñga) grass, for the sake of chasing away the evil spirits, the reed being a thunderbolt. It is plaited afterthe manner of a braid of hair. For were it to be twisted  sunwise (from left to right) as any other cords, it would be human; and were it twisted contrary to the course of the sun, it would be sacred to the Fathers: hence it is plaited after the manner of a braid of hair.
2	1	14	He girds himself with it, with the text , 'Thou art the strength of the Aṅgiras,'--for the Aṅgiras perceived this (source of) strength; 'soft as wool, bestow thou strength on me!' there is nothing obscure in this.
2	1	15	He then tucks up the end of his (nether) garment, with the text, 'Thou art Soma's tuck.' For heretofore it was the tuck of him, the unconsecrated; but now that he is consecrated, it is that of Soma : therefore he says, 'Thou art Soma's tuck.'
2	1	16	He then wraps up (his head) . For he who is consecrated becomes an embryo; and embryos are enveloped both by the amnion and the outer membrane: therefore he covers (his head).
2	1	17	He covers himself, with the text, 'Thou art Vishnu's refuge, the refuge of the sacrificer.' He who is consecrated indeed becomes both Vishnu and a sacrificer; for when he is consecrated, he is Vishnu; and when he sacrifices, he is the sacrificer: therefore he says, 'Thou art Vishnu's refuge, the refuge of the sacrificer.'
2	1	18	Thereupon he ties a black deer's horn to theend (of his garment ). Now the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pragâpati, entered upon their father Pragâpati's inheritance: the gods came in for the Mind and the Asuras for Speech. Thereby the gods came in for the sacrifice and Asuras for speech; the gods for yonder (heaven) and the Asuras for this (earth).
2	1	19	The gods said to Yagña (m., the sacrifice), 'That Vâk (f., speech) is a woman: beckon her, and she will certainly call thee to her.' Or it may be, he himself thought, 'That Vâk is a woman: I will beckon her and she will certainly call me to her.' He accordingly beckoned her. She, however, at first disdained him from the distance: and hence a woman, when beckoned by a man, at first disdains him from the distance. He said, 'She has disdained me from the distance.'
2	1	20	They said, 'Do but beckon her, reverend sir, and she will certainly call thee to her.' He beckoned her; but she only replied to him, as it were, by shaking her head: and hence a woman, when beckoned by a man, only replies to him, as it were, by shaking her head. He said, 'She has only replied to me by shaking her head.'
2	1	21	They said, 'Do but beckon her, reverend sir, and she will certainly call thee to her.' He beckoned her, and she called him to her; and hence a woman at last calls the man to her. He said, 'She has indeed called me.'
2	1	22	The gods reflected, 'That Vâk being a woman, we must take care lest she should allure him .--Say to her, "Come hither to me where I stand!" and report to us her having come.' She then went up to where he was standing. Hence a woman goes to a man who stays in a well-trimmed (house). He reported to them her having come, saying, 'She has indeed come.'
2	1	23	The gods then cut her off from the Asuras; and having gained possession of her and enveloped her completely in fire, they offered her up as a holocaust, it being an offering of the gods . And in that they offered her with an anushtubh verse, thereby they made her their own; and the Asuras, being deprived of speech, were undone, crying, 'He ’lavah! he ’lavah !
2	1	24	Such was the unintelligible speech which they then uttered,--and he (who speaks thus) is a Mlekkha (barbarian). Hence let no Brahman speak barbarous language, since such is the speech of the Asuras. Thus alone he deprives his spiteful enemies of speech; and whosoever knows this, his enemies, being deprived of speech, are undone.
2	1	25	That Yagña (sacrifice) lusted after Vâk (speech ), thinking, 'May I pair with her!' He united with her.
2	1	26	Indra then thought within himself, 'Surely a great monster will spring from this union of Yagña and Vâk: [I must take care] lest it should get the better of me.' Indra himself then became an embryo and entered into that union.
2	1	27	Now when he was born after a year's time, he thought within himself, 'Verily of great vigour is this womb which has contained me: [I must take care] that no great monster shall be born from it after me, lest it should get the better of me!'
2	1	28	Having seized and pressed it tightly, he tore it off and put it on the head of Yagña (sacrifice );for the black (antelope) is the sacrifice: the black deer skin is the same as that sacrifice, and the black deer's horn is the same as that womb. And because it was by pressing it tightly together that Indra tore out (the womb), therefore it (the horn) is bound tightly (to the end of the garment); and as Indra,having become an embryo, sprang from that union, so is he (the sacrificer), after becoming an embryo, born from that union (of the skin and the horn).
2	1	29	He ties it (to the end of the garment) with the open part upwards, for it is in this way that the womb bears the embryo. He then touches with it his forehead close over the right eyebrow, with the text, 'Thou art Indra's womb,'--for it is indeed Indra's womb, since in entering it he enters thereby , and in being born he is born therefrom: therefore he says, 'Thou art Indra's womb.'
2	1	30	Thereupon he draws (with the horn) the ('easterly') line, with the text, 'Make the crops full-eared!' Thereby he produces the sacrifice; for when there is a good year, then there is abundant (material) for sacrifice; but when there is a bad year, then there is not even enough for himself: hence he thereby produces the sacrifice.
2	1	31	And let not the consecrated henceforth scratch himself either with a chip of wood or with his nail. For he who is consecrated becomes an embryo; and were any one to scratch an embryo either with a chip of wood or his nail, thereby expelling it, it would die . Thereafter the consecrated would be liable to be affected with the itch; and--offspring (retas) coming after the consecrated--that offspring would then also be liable to be born with the itch. Now hisown womb  does not injure its offspring, and that black deer's horn being indeed his own womb, that (horn) does not injure him; and therefore the consecrated should scratch himself with the black deer's horn and with nothing but the black deer's horn.
2	1	32	He (the Adhvaryu) then hands to him a staff, for driving away the evil spirits,--the staff being a thunderbolt.
2	1	33	It is of Udumbara wood (Ficus Glomerata), for him to obtain food and strength,--the Udumbara means food and strength: therefore it is of Udumbara wood.
2	1	34	It reaches up to his mouth,--for so far extends his strength: as great as his strength is, so great it (the staff) is when it reaches up to his mouth.
2	1	35	He makes it stand upright, with the text, 'Stand up, O tree, erect; guard me from injury on to the goal of this sacrifice!' whereby he means to say, 'Standing erect, protect me till the completion of this sacrifice!'
2	1	36	It is only now that some bend the fingers inward  and restrain their speech, because, they argue, only from now will he not have to mutter anything. But let him not do so; for in like manner as if one were to try to overtake some one who runs away, but could not overtake him, so does he not overtake the sacrifice. Let him therefore turn in his fingers and restrain his speech on that (former) occasion.
2	1	37	And when the consecrated (after restraining his speech) utters either a rik, or a sâman, or a yagus ,he thereby takes a firmer and firmer hold of the sacrifice: let him therefore turn in his fingers and restrain his speech on that (former) occasion.
2	1	38	And when he restrains his speech--speech being sacrifice--he thereby appropriates the sacrifice to himself . But when, from speech restrained, he utters any sound (foreign to the sacrifice), then that sacrifice, being set free, flies away. In that case, then, let him mutter either a rik or a yagus addressed to Vishnu, for Vishnu is the sacrifice: thereby he again gets hold of the sacrifice; and this is the atonement for that (transgression).
2	1	39	Thereupon some one  calls out, 'Consecrated is this Brâhman, consecrated is this Brâhman:' him, being thus announced, he thereby announces to the gods: 'Of great vigour is this one who has obtained the sacrifice; he has become one of yours: protect him!' this is what he means to say. Thrice he says it, for threefold is the sacrifice.
2	1	40	And as to his saying, 'Brâhman,' uncertain, as it were, is his origin heretofore ; for the Rakshas, they say, pursue women here oil earth, and so the Rakshas implant their seed therein. But he, forsooth, is truly born, who is born of the Brahman (neut.), of the sacrifice: wherefore let him address even a Râganya, or a Vaisya, as Brâhman, since he who is born of the sacrifice is born of the Brahman (and hence a Brâhmana). Wherefore they say, 'Let no one slay a sacrificer of Soma; for by (slaying) a Soma-sacrificer he becomes guilty of a heinous sin !
2	2	1	He maintains silence; and silently he remains seated till sunset. The reason why he maintains silence is this:
2	2	2	By means of the sacrifice the gods gained that supreme authority which they now wield. They spake, 'How can this (world) of ours be made unattainable to men?' They sipped the sap of the sacrifice, even as bees would suck out honey; and having drained the sacrifice and scattered it by means of the sacrificial post, they disappeared: and because they scattered (yopaya, viz. the sacrifice) therewith, therefore it is called yûpa (post) .
2	2	3	Now this was heard by the Rishis. They collected the sacrifice. As that sacrifice was collected (prepared) , so does he who is consecrated collect the sacrifice (by keeping his speech within him),--for the sacrifice is speech.
2	2	4	When the sun has set, he breaks silence. Now Pragâpati is the year, since the sacrifice is Pragâpati; and the year is day and night, since these two revolving produce it. He has been consecrated during the day, and he has gained the night: as great as the sacrifice is, as great as is its extent, to that extent has he gained it before he breaks silence.
2	2	5	Some, however, make him break his silence on seeing the (first) start , arguing that then the sun has actually set. But let him not do so, for what would become of them if it were cloudy? Let him therefore break silence as soon as he thinks the sun has set.
2	2	6	Now, some make him break silence by the formula, 'Earth! ether! sky!' arguing that thereby they strengthen the sacrifice, they heal, the sacrifice. But let him not do so; for he who breaks silence with that (formula) does not strengthen the sacrifice, does not heal the sacrifice.
2	2	7	Let him rather break silence with this one , 'Prepare ye the fast-food! prepare ye the fast-food! [prepare ye the fast-food!] Agni is the Brahman, Agni is the sacrifice; the tree is meet for the sacrifice.' For this indeed is his sacrifice, this is his havis-offering at this (rite of consecration), even as the Agnihotra was heretofore . In thus preparing the (Soma) sacrifice by means of the sacrifice, he establishes the sacrificein the sacrifice, and carries on the sacrifice by means of the sacrifice; for (the partaking of) that fast-food is indeed carried on by him till the pressing of the Soma. Thrice he pronounces (the first words ), for threefold is the sacrifice.
2	2	8	Moreover, he breaks silence, after turning round towards the fire. He, on the other hand, who breaks silence with any other (formula) but this , does not strengthen the sacrifice, does not heal the sacrifice. In pronouncing the first (part of the formula)  he utters the truth of speech .
2	2	9	'Agni is the Brahman' (neut.), he says, for Agni is indeed the Brahman (sacerdotium);--'Agni is the sacrifice,' for Agni is indeed the sacrifice;--'the tree is meet for the sacrifice,' for trees  are indeed meet for the sacrifice, since men could not sacrifice, if there were no trees: therefore he says, 'the tree is meet for the sacrifice.'
2	2	10	Thereupon they cook the fast-food for him. For he who is consecrated draws nigh to the gods and becomes one of the deities. But the sacrificial food of the gods must be cooked, and not uncooked: hence they cook it, and he partakes of that fast-milk[paragraph continues] (vrata) and does not offer it in the fire. The reason why he eats the fast-food and does not offer it in the fire is this:
2	2	11	By means of the sacrifice the gods gained that supreme authority which they now wield. They spake, 'How can this (world) of ours be made unattainable to men?' They sipped the sap of the sacrifice, even as bees would suck out honey; and having drained the sacrifice and scattered it by means of the sacrificial post, they disappeared. And because they scattered (yopaya) therewith, therefore it is called yûpa (post).
2	2	12	Now this was heard by the Rishis. They collected the sacrifice. As that sacrifice was collected, so does he who is consecrated now become the sacrifice, for it is he that carries it on, that produces it. And whatever (sap) of the sacrifice was sucked out and drained, that he now restores again by sipping the fast-milk and not offering it in the fire; for, assuredly, were he to offer it in the fire, he would not replenish (the sacrifice). But let him, nevertheless, think (that he does so) sacrificing and not the reverse.
2	2	13	For, verily, these vital airs are born of the mind, endowed with mind , of intelligent power : Agni is speech; Mitra and Varuna are the out-breathing and the in-breathing; Âditya (the sun) is the eye; and the All-gods are the ear,--it is unto these deities that offering is thereby made by him.
2	2	14	Now, some add both rice and barley to the first (day's) fast-milk, arguing,--"By means of these two substances (rasa) we restore what part of the sacrifice was sucked out and drained; and, shouldthe vrata-cow yield no milk, he may prepare his fast-food of whichever of these (cereals) he pleases; and thus both the rice and the barley are 'taken hold of' by him." But let him not do this; for he who adds both rice and barley (to the milk) neither replenishes the sacrifice nor heals it. Let him therefore add only the one or the other (cereal). Both the rice and barley doubtless form his (havis) material for offering (at the New and Full-moon Sacrifice), and when they do so become his material for offering, then they are also 'taken hold of ' by him. Should the vrata, cow yield no milk, let him prepare the fast-food of whichever of them he pleases.
2	2	15	Some, again, add to the first (day's) fast-food (vrata) all manner of vegetables and fragrant (seasoning), arguing,--'If disease were to befall him, he might cure it by whatever thereof he pleases, as if he cured it by the fast-milk .' But let him notdo this, lest he should do what is inauspicious to the sacrifice; for those people do at the sacrifice what is a human act, and inauspicious to the sacrifice assuredly is that which is human. If any disease were to befall him who is consecrated, let him cure it wherewith he pleases; for completion is proper .
2	2	16	He (the Adhvaryu) hands the fast-food to him, after letting the ordinary (meal-)time pass,--viz. the evening-milk in the latter part of the night, and the morning-milk in the afternoon,--for the sake of distinction: he thereby distinguishes the divine from the human.
2	2	17	And when he is about to hand the fast-food to him he makes him touch water , with the text, 'For protection we direct our thoughts to divine devotion, the source of supreme mercy , the bestower of glory and the bearer of sacrifices : may it prosper our ways, according to our desire!' Heretofore, indeed, it was for a human meal that he cleansed himself, but now it is for the sake of divine devotion: therefore he says, 'For the sake of assistance we turn our thoughts to divine devotion, the source of supreme mercy, the bestower of glory, the bearer of sacrifices: may itprosper our ways, according to our desire!' Whenever, being about to take the fast-food, he touches water, let him touch it with this same (formula).
2	2	18	Thereupon he drinks the fast-food, with the text, 'May the gods favour us, they who are born of the mind, and endowed with mind , and of intelligent power! may they protect us! Hail to them!' Thus that (fast-food) comes to be for him (by means of the Svâhâ) as an oblation consecrated by the Vashat.
2	2	19	Having drank the fast-food, he touches his navel , with the text , 'Ye waters that have been drank, may ye become palatable and auspicious within us! may they prove agreeable to us, freeing us from disease and weakness and sin,--they the divine, the immortal, the holy!' Now, he who is consecrated draws nigh to the gods and becomes one of the deities; but the sacrificial food of the gods is not increased (with other material): hence, if in handing the fast-food (to the consecrated) he increases it (with other milk), he commits a fault and breaks the fast. This (formula), however, is the atonement for that (transgression), and thus that fault is not committed by him, and he does not break the fast (or  vow): therefore he says, 'Ye waters . . . !' Whenever, after drinking the fast-food, he touches his navel, let him touch it with this (formula); for whoknows whether (or not) he who hands the fast-food (to the consecrated) increases it (with other milk) !
2	2	20	When he intends to pass urine, he takes up a clod of earth or some other object by means of the deer's horn, with the text , 'This (O Earth) is thy covering meet for worship.' For this earth truly is divine, and serves as a place for the worship of the gods: it must not be defiled by him who is consecrated. Having lifted up this its sacrificially pure covering , he now relieves himself on its impure body, with the formula, 'I discharge not offspring, but waters,'--for so indeed he does ; 'delivering from trouble, and consecrated by Svâhâ,'--for they do indeed deliver from trouble what is pressed together inside: therefore he says, 'delivering from trouble,'--'consecrated by Svâhâ, enter ye the earth!' whereby he means to say, 'Having become offerings, do ye enter the earth, appeased!'
2	2	21	Thereupon he throws the clod of earth down again, with the text, 'Unite with the earth!' for truly this earth is divine, and serves as a place for the worship of the gods: it must not be defiled by him who is consecrated. Having lifted up this itssacrificially pure covering, he has relieved himself on its impure body, and now restores to it this its pure covering: therefore he says, 'Unite with the earth!'
2	2	22	He then gives himself up to Agni (the fire) for protection and lies down to sleep. For he who is consecrated draws nigh to the gods and becomes one of the deities; but the gods do not sleep, while to him sleeplessness is not vouchsafed; and Agni being Lord of vows to the gods, it is to him that he now commits himself and lies down to sleep, with the text , 'O Agni, be thou a good waker: may we thoroughly refresh ourselves!' whereby he says, 'O Agni, wake thou: we are going to sleep!'--'Guard us unremittingly!' whereby he means to say, 'protect us heedfully!'--'Make us awake again!' whereby he means to say, 'Order so that, having rested here, we may awake safely.'
2	2	23	And when he has slept and does not wish to fall asleep again, (the Adhvaryu) makes him mutter the text , 'Thought and life have come back to me, breath and soul have come back to me, eye and ear have come back to me;' for all these depart from him when he sleeps; the breath alone does not; and after he has slept he again unites with them: therefore he says, 'Thought and life have come back to me . . .'--'May Agni Vaisvânara, the unassailable preserver of lives, preserve us from mishap and shame!' whereby he means to say, 'May Agni save us from whatever mistake (may be committed) on this occasion, either by sleep or otherwise:' this is why he says, 'May Agni Vaisvânara, the unassailable preserver of lives, preserve us from mishap and shame!'
2	2	24	For, when he who is consecrated utters anythingthat is foreign to the vow, or when he becomes angry, he commits a fault and breaks his vow, since suppression of anger behoves him who is consecrated. Now, Agni is the Lord of vows among the gods,--it is to him therefore that he resorts : 'Thou, O Agni, art the divine guardian of vows among men, to whom praise is due at the sacrifices.' This, then, is his atonement for that (transgression); and thus that fault is not committed by him, and he does not break his vow: therefore he says, 'Thou, O Agni, art the divine guardian of vows among men, to whom praise is due at the sacrifices.'
2	2	25	And whatever (gift) people offer to him , thereon he (the Adhvaryu) makes him pronounce the text, 'Bestow this much, O Soma, bring more!' for Soma indeed it is that appropriates for the consecrated whatever people offer to him: when he says, 'Bestow this much, O Soma,' he means to say, 'Bestow this much on us, O Soma;' and by 'Bring more,' he means to say, 'Fetch more for us!'--'The divine Savitri, the bestower of wealth, hath bestowed wealth on us;' whereby that (gift) comes to be impelled by Savitri with a view to (further) gifts.
2	2	26	Before sunset he (the Adhvaryu) says, 'Consecrated, restrain thy speech!' and after sunset he releases speech. Before sunrise he says, 'Consecrated, restrain thy speech!' and after sunrise he releaseshis speech,--for the sake of continuity: with the night he continues the day, and with the day the night.
2	2	27	Let not the sun set on him while abiding elsewhere (than the hall); nor let the sun rise on him while asleep. For were the sun to set on him while abiding elsewhere, he (the sun) would cut him off from the night; and were the sun to rise on him while asleep, he would cut him off from the day: there is no atonement for this, hence it must by all means be avoided. Prior to the purificatory bath he should not enter water, nor should it rain upon him; for it is improper that he should enter water, or that it should rain upon him, before the purificatory bath. Moreover, he speaks his speech falteringly, and not effusively after the manner of ordinary speech . The reason why he speaks his speech falteringly and not after the manner of ordinary speech is this:
2	2	28	By means of the sacrifice the gods gained that supreme authority which they now wield. They spake, 'How can this (world) of ours be made unattainable to men?' They sipped the sap of the sacrifice, even as bees would suck out honey; and having drained the sacrifice and scattered it by means of the sacrificial post, they disappeared. And because they scattered (yopaya) therewith, therefore it is called yûpa (post).
2	2	29	Now this was heard by the Rishis. They collected the sacrifice; and as that sacrifice was collected, so does he who is consecrated now collect the sacrifice (by keeping back his speech),--for the sacrifice is speech. And whatever part of the sacrificewas then sucked out and drained, that he now restores again by speaking his speech falteringly and not effusively after the manner of ordinary speech. For were he to speak effusively after the manner of ordinary speech, he would not restore (the sap of the sacrifice): therefore he speaks his speech falteringly and not effusively after the manner of ordinary speech.
2	2	30	He verily anoints himself,--it is for speech that he anoints himself , since he anoints himself for the sacrifice, and the sacrifice is speech. Dhîkshita (the anointed) doubtless is the same as dîkshita (the consecrated).
2	3	1	He prepares the Prâyanîya rice-pap for Aditi. Now while the gods were spreading (performing) the sacrifice on this (earth) they excluded her (the earth) from the sacrifice. She thought, 'How is it that, in spreading the sacrifice on me, they should exclude me from the sacrifice?' and confounded their sacrifice: they knew not that sacrifice.
2	3	2	They said, 'How comes it that our sacrifice was confounded, when we spread it on this (earth)? how is it that we know it not?'
2	3	3	They said, 'In spreading the sacrifice on her, we have excluded her from the sacrifice: it is she that has confounded our sacrifice,--let us have recourse to her!'
2	3	4	They said, 'When we were spreading the sacrifice on thee, how was it that it became confounded, that we know it not?'
2	3	5	She said, 'While spreading the sacrifice on me, ye have excluded me from the sacrifice: that was why I have confounded your sacrifice. Set ye aside a share for me; then ye shall see the sacrifice, then ye shall know it!'
2	3	6	'So be it!' said the gods: 'Thine, forsooth, shall be the opening (prâyanîya ), and thine the concluding (udayanîya) oblation!' This is why both the Prâyanîya and the Udayanîya (pap) belongto Aditi; for Aditi truly is this (earth). Thereupon they saw and spread the sacrifice.
2	3	7	Hence, when he prepares the Prâyanîya rice-pap for Aditi, he does so for the purpose of his seeing the sacrifice: 'After seeing the sacrifice I shall buy (the Soma) and spread that (sacrifice);' thus thinking he prepares the Prâyanîya pap for Aditi. The sacrificial food had been prepared, but offering had not yet been made to the deity (Aditi),--
2	3	8	When Pathyâ Svasti  appeared to them. They offered to her, for Pathyâ Svasti (the wishing of 'a happy journey') is speech, and the sacrifice also is speech. Thereby they perceived the sacrifice and spread it.
2	3	9	Thereupon Agni appeared to them: they offered to him; whereby they perceived that part of the sacrifice which was of Agni's nature. Now of Agni's nature is what is dry in the sacrifice: that they thereby perceived and spread.
2	3	10	Then Soma appeared to them: they offered to him; whereby they perceived that part of the sacrifice which was of Soma's nature. Now of Soma's nature is what is moist in the sacrifice: that they thereby perceived and spread.
2	3	11	Then Savitri appeared to them: they offered to him. Now Savitri represents cattle, and the sacrifice also means cattle: hence they thereby perceived and spread the sacrifice. Thereupon they offered to the deity (Aditi), for whom the sacrificial food had been prepared.
2	3	12	It is to these same five deities, then, that he offers. For that sacrifice, when thrown into disorder,was in five parts; and by means of those five deities they recognised it.
2	3	13	The seasons became confounded, the five: by means of those same five deities they recognised them.
2	3	14	The regions became confounded, the five: by means of those same five deities they recognised them.
2	3	15	Through Pathyâ Svasti they recognised the northern (upper) region: wherefore speech sounds higher here  among the Kuru-Pañkâlas; for she (Pathyâ Svasti) is in reality speech, and through her they recognised the northern region, and to her belongs the northern region.
2	3	16	Through Agni they recognised the eastern region: wherefore they take out Agni from behind towards the east , and render homage to him; for through him they recognised the eastern region, and to him belongs the eastern region.
2	3	17	Through Soma they recognised the southern region: hence, after the Soma has been bought, they drive it round on the south side; and hence they say that Soma is sacred to the Fathers; for through him they recognised the southern region, and to him belongs the southern region.
2	3	18	Through Savitri they recognised the western region, for Savitri is yonder burning (sun): wherefore he goes towards the west, for through him they recognised the western region, and to him belongs the western region.
2	3	19	Through Aditi they recognised the upper region, for Aditi is this (earth): wherefore the plants and trees grow upwards on her; for through her they recognised the upper region, and to her belongs the upper region.
2	3	20	The hospitable reception  (of King Soma) verily is the head of the sacrifice, and the opening and closing oblations are its arms. But the arms are on both sides of the head, and hence those two oblations, the Prâyanîya and Udayanîya, are made on both sides of (before and after) the reception.
2	3	21	Now, they say that whatever is done at the Prâyanîya should be done at the Udayanîya , and the barhis (grass-covering of the altar), which is used at the Prâyanîya, is also used at the Udayanîya: he lays it aside, after removing it (from the altar). The pot (in which the rice-pap was cooked) he puts aside with the parched remains of dough, and (so he does) the pot-ladle after wiping it. And the priests who officiate during the Prâyanîya, officiate also at the Udayanîya. And because of this identical performance at the sacrifice the two arms are alike and of the same shape.
2	3	22	But let him not do it in this way. Let him rather  (at the proper time) throw both the barhis and the pot-ladle after (the prastara, into the fire ), and let him put the pot aside after rinsing it. The priests who officiate during the Prâyanîya, officiate also at the Udayanîya; but should they (in themean time) have departed this life, others may officiate instead. It is because he offers to the same deities, and the same oblations, that the two arms are alike and of the same shape.
2	3	23	To five deities he offers at the Prâyanîya, and to five at the Udayanîya: hence there are five fingers here and five there. This (Prâyanîya offering) ends with the Samyu. They perform no Patnîsamyâgas . For the arms are on the fore-part of the body, and the fore-part of the sacrifice he perfects by this (opening ceremony). This is why it ends with the Samyu, and why no Patnîsamyâgas are performed.
2	4	1	Now Soma was in the sky, and the gods were here on earth. The gods desired,--'Would that Soma came to us: we might sacrifice with him, when come.' They created those two illusions, Suparnî and Kadrû. In the chapter on the hearths (dhishnya ) it is set forth how that affair of Suparnî and Kadrû came to pass.
2	4	2	Gâyatrî flew up to Soma for them. While she was carrying him off, the Gandharva Visvâvasu stole him from her. The gods were aware of this,--'Soma has indeed been removed from yonder (sky), but he comes not to us, for the Gandharvas have stolen him.'
2	4	3	They said, 'The Gandharvas are fond of women: let us send Vâk (speech) to them, and she will return to us together with Soma.' They sent Vâk to them, and she returned to them together with Soma.
2	4	4	The Gandharvas came after her and said, 'Soma (shall be) yours, and Vâk ours !' 'So be it!' said the gods; 'but if she would rather come hither, do not ye carry her off by force: let us woo her!' They accordingly wooed her.
2	4	5	The Gandharvas recited the Vedas to her, saying, 'See how we know it, see how we know it !'
2	4	6	The gods then created the lute and sat playing and singing, saying, 'Thus we will sing to thee, thus we will amuse thee!' She turned to the gods; but, in truth, she turned to them vainly, since she turned away from those, engaged in praising and praying, to dance and song. Wherefore even to this day women are given to vain things: for it was on this wise that Vâk turned thereto, and other women do as she did. And hence it is to him who dances and sings that they most readily take a fancy .
2	4	7	Both Soma and Vâk were thus with the gods. Now, when he buys Soma he does so in order that he may sacrifice with him, when obtained, for his (own) obtainment (of heavenly bliss ); for he whosacrifices with Soma that has not been bought, sacrifices with Soma that has not been (properly) obtained .
2	4	8	In the first place he pours the butter, which remains in the dhruvâ spoon, in four parts into the guhû; and having tied a piece of gold with a blade of the altar-grass , and laid it down (in the guhû), he offers (the butter), thinking, 'I will offer with pure milk;' for milk and gold are of the same origin, since both have sprung from Agni's seed .
2	4	9	He lays down the piece of gold, with the text , 'This (butter) is thy body, O shining (Agni)! this (gold) is thy light,'--for that gold is indeed light:--'unite therewith and obtain splendour!' When he says, 'Unite therewith,' he means to say, 'Mingle therewith;' and when he says, 'Obtain splendour,'--splendour meaning Soma,--he means to say, 'Obtain Soma.'
2	4	10	And as the gods then sent her (Vâk) to Soma, so does he now send her to Soma; and the cow for which the Soma is bought being in reality Vâk, it is her he gratifies by this offering, thinking, 'With her, when gratified, I shall buy the Soma.'
2	4	11	He offers, with the text, 'Thou art the singer of praises ,'--for this (word 'gûh'), the 'singer of praises,' is one of her (Vâk's) names;--'upholden by the Mind,'--this speech of oursis indeed upheld by the mind, because the Mind goes before  Speech (and prompts her), 'Speak thus! say not this!' for, were it not for the Mind, Speech would indeed talk incoherently: for this reason he says, 'Upholden by the Mind.'
2	4	12	'Well-pleasing to Vishnu,' whereby he means to say, 'Well-pleasing to Soma whom we approach .' [He proceeds, Vâg. S. IV,
2	4	18	], 'Inspired by thee of true inspiration,' whereby he means to say, 'Be thou of true inspiration! go thou to Soma for us!'--'May I obtain a support for my body, Svâhâ!' for he who reaches the end of the sacrifice, indeed obtains a support for his body: hence he thereby means to say, 'May I reach the end of the sacrifice!'
2	4	13	Thereupon he takes out the piece of gold (from the spoon), whereby he bestows gold on men; but were he to offer (the butter) together with the gold, he would doubtless cast the gold away from men, and no gold would then be gained among men.
2	4	14	He takes it out, with the text, Thou art pure, thou art shining, thou art immortal, thou art sacred to all the gods.' When, having offered the whole milk, he now says, 'Thou art pure . . . ,' it is indeed pure, and shining, and immortal, and sacred to all the gods. Having loosened the grass-blade, he throws it on the barhis, and ties a string round the gold .
2	4	15	Having then taken butter a second time infour parts, he says, 'Sacrificer, hold on behind !' They open the (south and east)  doors of the hall (and walk out). On the right side (of the front door) approaches the Soma-cow : (by having) her thus put forward , he has sent her forth (to Soma); for the Soma-cow is in reality Vâk: it is her he has gratified by this offering, thinking, 'With her, when gratified, I will buy Soma.'
2	4	16	Having gone up to her, he (the Adhvaryu) salutes her, with the text , 'Thou art thought, thou art the mind,'--for speech, doubtless, speaks in accordance with thought, with the mind ;--'Thou art intelligence, thou art the Dakshinâ ,'--for it is by means of their respective intelligence  that people seek to make their living, either by reciting (the Veda), or by readiness of speech , or by songs: therefore he says, 'Thou art intelligence;' and 'Dakshinâ' (gift to the priests) he calls her, because she is indeed the Dakshinâ;--[paragraph continues] 'Thou art supreme, thou art worthy of worship,'--for she is indeed supreme and worthy of worship;--'Thou art Aditi, the double-headed,'--inasmuch as, through her (Vâk, speech), he speaks the right thing wrongly, and puts last what comes first, and first what comes last, therefore she is double-headed: that is why he says, 'Thou art Aditi, the double-headed .'
2	4	17	'Be thou for us successful (in going) forward and successful (in coming) back!' when he says, 'Be thou for us successful (in going) forward,' he means to say, 'Go to (fetch) Soma for us!' and when he says, 'Be thou successful (in coming) back,' he means to say, 'Come back to us with Soma!' This is why he says, 'Be thou for us successful (in going) forward and successful (in coming) back!'
2	4	18	'May Mitra bind thee by the foot!' For that rope, doubtless, is of Varuna; and were she (the cow) tied with a rope, she would be (under the power) of Varuna. And, on the other hand, were she not tied at all, she would be uncontrolled. Now that which is of Mitra is not of Varuna; and as (a cow), if tied with a rope, is under control, so it is in the case of this one when he says, 'May Mitra bind thee by the foot!'
2	4	19	'May Pûshan guard thy paths!' Now Pûshan is this Earth, and for whomsoever she is the guardian of his paths , he stumbles not at any time: therefore he says, 'May Pûshan guard thy paths!'
2	4	20	'For Indra as the supreme guide;'--whereby he says, 'May she be well-guarded!' [Heproceeds, Vâg. S. IV,
2	4	20	], 'May thy mother grant thee permission, thy father, thine own brother, thy fellow in the herd!' whereby he says, 'Go thou for us to fetch Soma, with the permission of all thy kin.'--'O goddess, go to the god,'--for it is indeed as a goddess, as Vâk, that she goes to a god, to Soma: therefore he says, 'O goddess, go to the god;'--'To Soma for the sake of Indra!' Indra truly is the deity of the sacrifice: therefore he says, 'To Soma for the sake of Indra.' 'May Rudra guide thee back!' this he says for her safety, for cattle cannot pass beyond Rudra . 'Hail to thee! come back, with Soma for thy companion!' whereby he says, 'Hail to thee, come back to us together with Soma!'
2	4	21	Even as, at that time, the gods sent her to Soma, and she returned to them together with Soma, so does he now send her to Soma, and she returns to him together with Soma.
2	4	22	And as the gods then wooed her with the Gandharvas, and she turned to the gods, so does the sacrificer now woo her, and she turns to the sacrificer. They lead her (the Soma-cow) northwards round (to the place where the Soma is to be sold); for the north is the quarter of men, and hence it is that of the sacrificer for this reason they lead her northwards round.
3	1	1	He follows her, stepping into seven foot-prints of hers ; he thereby takes possession of her: thatis why he steps into seven of her foot-prints. For when the metres were produced from Vâk (speech), the one consisting of seven feet, the Sakvarî, was the last (highest) of them. It is that (metre) he now draws down towards himself from above: this is why he steps into seven of her foot-prints.
3	1	2	It is as Vâk  that he steps into them; , 'Thou art a Vasvî, thou art Aditi, thou art an Âdityâ, thou art a Rudrâ, thou art Kandrâ; for she is indeed a Vasvî and Aditi, an Âdityâ, a Rudrâ, Kandrâ. 'May Brihaspati make thee rest in happiness!'--Brihaspati being the Brahman, he thereby means to say, 'May Brihaspati lead thee hither by means of the good (work) !' 'Rudra, together with the Vasus, is well-pleased with thee:' this he says to secure her (the cow's) safety, for cattle cannot pass beyond Rudra.
3	1	3	They now sit down  round the seventh footprint; and having laid down the piece of gold in the foot-print, he offers. For offering is made on nothing but fire, and the gold has sprung from Agni's seed: and thus that offering of his is indeed made overthe fire. And the clarified butter being a thunderbolt, he now delivers her (the cow) by means of that thunderbolt, the butter; and by delivering her he makes her his own.
3	1	4	He (the Adhvaryu) offers , 'On Aditi's head I pour thee;' for Aditi being this earth, it is on the head of the latter that he offers;--'on the worshipping-ground of the earth'--for on the worshipping-ground of the earth he indeed offers;--'Thou art Idâ's footprint, filled with butter, Hail!' for Idâ being the cow , he indeed offers on the cow's foot-print; and 'filled with butter, Hail!' he says, because it indeed becomes filled with butter when offered upon.
3	1	5	Thereupon he takes the wooden sword and draws lines round (the foot-print): the wooden sword being a thunderbolt, it is with the thunderbolt that he draws round it. Thrice he draws round it, so that he encompasses it on all sides with a threefold thunderbolt, for no one to trespass upon it.
3	1	6	He draws the lines (with the texts), 'Rejoice in us!' whereby he means to say, 'Rejoice in the sacrificer!' Having then, by tracing, cut out the foot-print all round , he throws it into the pan, with, 'In us is thy kinship,' whereby he means to say, 'In the sacrificer is thy kinship.'
3	1	7	He then pours some water on (the place whence the earth has been removed). Wherever in digging they hurt her (the earth) and knock off anythingfrom her,--water being (a means of) soothing,--that he now soothes by means of water, that he heals by means of water: that is why he pours water thereon.
3	1	8	He then hands (the dust of) the foot-print to the sacrificer, with, 'In thee is wealth,'--wealth meaning cattle, he thereby means to say, 'in thee is cattle.' The sacrificer receives it with, 'With me  is wealth,'--wealth meaning cattle, he thereby means to say, 'with me is cattle.'
3	1	9	The Adhvaryu then touches himself (near the heart), with, 'May we not be deprived of prosperity!' Thus the Adhvaryu does not exclude himself from (the possession of) cattle.
3	1	10	Thereupon they hand (the dust of) the footprint over to the (sacrificer's) wife. The house being the wife's resting-place, he thereby establishes her in that safe resting-place, the house: for this reason he hands over the (earth of the) foot-print to the wife.
3	1	11	The Neshtri makes her say, 'Thine, thine  is wealth;' whereupon he causes her to be looked at by the Soma-cow. Now, Soma is a male, and the wife is a female, and that Soma-cow becomes here (exchanged for) Soma: a productive union is thus effected;--this is why he causes her to be looked at by the Soma-cow.
3	1	12	He causes her to be looked at , 'I have seen eye to eye with the divine intelligence, with the far-seeing Dakshinâ: takenot my life from me, neither will I take thine; may I obtain a hero  in thy sight!' She thereby asks a blessing: a hero meaning a son, she thereby means to say, 'May I obtain a son in thy sight!'
3	1	13	One that is brown, with red-brown eyes, is (fit to be) a Soma-cow. For when Indra and Vishnu divided a thousand (cows) into three parts, there was one left , and her they caused to propagate herself in three kinds; and hence, even now, if any one were to divide a thousand by three, one would remain over.
3	1	14	The brown one, with red-brown eyes, is the Soma-cow; and that ruddy one is the Vritra-killer's (India's) own, whom the king here chooses for himself  after winning the battle; and the ruddy one with reddish-white eyes  is the Fathers' own whom they slay here for the Fathers.
3	1	15	Let, then, the brown one, with red-brown eyes, be the Soma-cow. And if he be unable to obtain a brown one with red-brown eyes, let it be a dark-red  one. And if he be unable to obtain a dark-red one, let it be a ruddy one, one of the[paragraph continues] Vritra-killer's own. But let him nowise turn his fancy upon a ruddy one with reddish-white eyes.
3	1	16	Let it be one that is not impregnated. For that Soma-cow is in reality Vâk, and this Vâk (speech) is of unimpaired vigour; and of unimpaired vigour is one not (yet) impregnated: let it therefore be one not impregnated. Let it be one that is neither tailless, nor hornless, nor one-eyed, nor ear-less , nor specially marked, nor seven-hoofed ;--for such a one is uniform, and uniform is this speech.
3	2	1	Having thrown the (earth of the) foot-print (into the pan), he (the Adhvaryu) washes his hands. Now as to why he washes his hands;--clarified butter being a thunderbolt, and the Soma being seed, he washes his hands lest  he should injure the seed, Soma, with the thunderbolt, the ghee.
3	2	2	Thereupon he ties the piece of gold to this (finger ). Now, twofold indeed is this (universe),--there is no third,--the truth and the untruth: the gods are the truth and men are the untruth. And gold having sprung from Agni's seed, he ties the gold to this (finger), in order that he may touch the twigs (of the Soma) with the truth, that he may handle the Soma by means of the truth.
3	2	3	He then orders (the sacrificer's men), 'Bring thou the Soma-cloth! bring thou the Soma-wrapper! bring thou the head-band!' Let some shining (cloth) be the Soma-cloth; for this is to be his (king Soma's ) garment, and shining indeed is his garment: and whosoever serves him with a shining (garment), he truly shines. But he who says, '(Bring) anything whatsoever,' he will indeed be anything whatsoever: let the Soma-cloth, therefore, be some splendid (cloth), and the Soma-wrapper one of any kind.
3	2	4	If he can get a head-band, let there be a headband; but if he cannot get a head-band, let him cut off from the Soma-wrapper a piece two or three fingers long, to serve as the head-band. Either the Adhvaryu or the Sacrificer takes the Soma-cloth, and some one or other the Soma-wrapper.
3	2	5	Now, in the first place, they pick the king (Soma). A pitcher of water is placed close to him, and a Brâhman sits beside him . Thither they (the priests and sacrificer) now proceed eastward.
3	2	6	While they go there, he (the Adhvaryu) makes[paragraph continues] (the sacrificer) say the text , 'Say thou, for me, unto Soma, "This is thy gâyatrî-part (bhâga) !" Say thou, for me, unto Soma, "This is thy trishtubh-part!" Say thou, for me, unto Soma, "This is thy gayatî-part!" Say thou, for me, unto Soma, "Obtain thou the supreme sovereignty of the names of metres!"' Now, when he (king Soma) is bought, he is bought for one (destination )--for the sovereignty of the metres, for the supreme sovereignty of the metres; and when they press him, they slay him: hereby now he says to him, 'It is for the sovereignty of the metres, for the supreme sovereignty of the metres that I buy thee, not for slaying thee.' Having gone there, he sits down (behind the Soma) with his face towards the east.
3	2	7	He touches (the Soma-plants), with, 'Ours thou art,'--thereby he (Soma), now that he has come (as a guest), becomes as it were one of his (the sacrificer's) own (people): for this reason he says, 'Ours thou art;'--'Thy pure (juice) is meet for the draught,' for he will indeed take therefrom the 'pure draught .' 'Let the pickers pick thee!' this he says for the sake of completeness.
3	2	8	Now some, on noticing any straw or (piece of) wood (among the Soma-plants), throw it away. But let him not do this; for--the Soma being the nobility and the other plants the common people, and thepeople being the nobleman's food--it would be just as if one were to take hold of and pull out some (food) he has put in his mouth, and throw it away. Hence let him merely touch it, with, 'Let the pickers pick thee!' Those pickers of his do indeed pick it.
3	2	9	He then spreads the cloth (over the ox-hide), either twofold or fourfold, with the fringe towards the east or north. Thereon he metes out the king (Soma); and because he metes out the king, therefore there is a measure,--both the measure among men and whatever other measure there is.
3	2	10	He metes out, with a verse to Savitri; for Savitri is the impeller of the gods, and so that (Soma) becomes for him impelled by Savitri to the purchase.
3	2	11	He metes out with an atikhandas-verse; for that one, viz. the atikhandas , embraces all metres; and so that (Soma) is meted out for him by means of all the metres: therefore he metes out with an atikhandas-verse.
3	2	12	He metes out, with the text , 'Unto that divine Savitri within the two bowls , the sage, I sing praises, to him of trueimpulse, the bestower of treasures, the wise and thoughtful friend;--he at whose impulse the resplendent light shone high, the golden-handed sage hath measured the ether with his form.'
3	2	13	Therewith  he metes out (the Soma) with all (five fingers), therewith with four, therewith with three, therewith with two, therewith with one; therewith with one, therewith with two, therewith with three, therewith with four, therewith with all (fingers); having laid (the two hands) together  he throws (Soma) thereon with the joined open hands.
3	2	14	He metes out while bending up and bending down (the fingers). The reason why he metes out in bending (the fingers) up and down is that he thereby makes those fingers of separate existence, and therefore they are born separate (from each other); and as to his meting out with all (fingers) together, these (fingers) are to be born, as it were, united. This is why he metes out in bending (the fingers) up and down.
3	2	15	And, again, as to his meting out in bending them up and down,--he thereby renders them of varied power, and hence these (fingers) are of variedpower. That is why he metes out in bending them up and down.
3	2	16	And, again, as to his meting out in bending them up and down,--he thereby harnesses a virâg  (to ply) thitherwards and hitherwards: going thither-wards, namely, it conveys the sacrifice to the gods, and coming hitherwards it assists men. This is why he metes out in bending (the fingers) up and down.
3	2	17	And as to his meting out ten times,--the virâg is of ten syllables, and the Soma is of virâg nature: for this reason he metes out ten times.
3	2	18	Having gathered up the ends of the Soma-cloth, he (the Adhvaryu) ties them together by means of the head-band, with, 'For descendants (I tie) thee;'--for it is indeed for (the purpose of obtaining) descendants that he buys it (Soma): what (part of man) here is, as it were, compressed between the head and the shoulders, that he thereby makes it to be for him (the sacrificer) .
3	2	19	He then makes a finger-hole in the middle (of the knot), with the text, 'Let the descendants breathe after thee!' For, in compressing (the cloth), he, as it were, strangles him (Soma and the sacrificer) and renders him breathless; hereby now he emits his breath from inside, and after him breathing the descendants also breathe: for this reason he says, 'Let the descendants breathe after thee.' Thereupon he hands him (Soma) to the Soma-seller. Now, then, of the bargain.
3	3	1	He bargains for the king (Soma); and because he bargains for the king, therefore any and everything is vendible here. He says, 'Soma-seller, is thy king Soma for sale?'--'He is for sale,' says the Soma-seller.--'I will buy him of thee!'--'Buy him!' says the Soma-seller.--'I will buy him of thee for one-sixteenth (of the cow).'--'King Soma, surely, is worth more than that!' says the Soma-seller.--'Yea, King Soma is worth more than that; but great, surely, is the greatness of the cow,' says the Adhvaryu.
3	3	2	'From the cow (comes) fresh milk, from her boiled milk, from her cream, from her sour curds, from her sour cream, from her curdled milk, from her butter, from her ghee, from her clotted curds, from her whey:
3	3	3	I will buy him of thee for one hoof !'--'King Soma, surely, is worth more than that!' says the Soma-seller.--'Yea, King Soma is worth more than that, but great, surely, is the greatness of the cow,' replies the Adhvaryu; and, having (each time) enumerated the same ten virtues, he says, 'I will buy him of thee for one foot,'--'for half (the cow),'--'for the cow!'--'King Soma has been bought!' says the Soma-seller, 'name the kinds!'
3	3	4	He (the Adhvaryu) says, 'Gold is thine, a cloth is thine, a goat is thine, a milch cow is thine, a pair of kine is thine, three other (cows) are thine!' And because they first bargain and afterwards come to terms, therefore about any and everything that is for sale here, people first bargain and afterwardscome to terms. And the reason why only the Adhvaryu enumerates the virtues of the cow, and not the Soma-seller those of the Soma, is that Soma is already glorified, since Soma is a god. And the Adhvaryu thereby glorifies the cow, thinking, 'Seeing her virtues he shall buy her!' This is why only the Adhvaryu enumerates the virtues of the cow, and not the Soma-seller those of the Soma.
3	3	5	And as to his bargaining five times:--the sacrifice being of equal measure with the year, and there being five seasons in the year, he thus obtains it (the sacrifice, Soma) in five (divisions), and therefore he bargains five times.
3	3	6	He then makes (the sacrificer) say on the gold  , 'Thee, the pure, I buy with the pure,' for he indeed buys the pure with the pure, when (he buys) Soma with gold;--'the brilliant with the brilliant,' for he indeed buys the brilliant with the brilliant, when (he buys) Soma with gold;--'the immortal with the immortal,' for he indeed buys the immortal with the immortal, when (he buys) Soma with gold.
3	3	7	He then tempts  the Soma-seller (with the gold): 'In compensation  for thy cow,' whereby he means to say, 'With the sacrificer (be) thy cow!'[paragraph continues] He then draws it (the gold) back towards the sacrificer, and throws it down, with, 'Ours be thy gold!' whereby he (the sacrificer) takes unto himself the vital energy, and the Soma-seller gets only the body. Thereupon the Soma-seller takes it .
3	3	8	He then makes him (the sacrificer) say on the she-goat, which stands facing the west, 'Thou art the bodily form of fervour,'--that she-goat was indeed produced as the bodily form of fervour, of Pragâpati; hence he says, 'Thou art the bodily form of fervour,'--'Pragâpati's kind,' because she brings forth three times in the year, therefore she is Pragâpati's kind. 'Thou art bought with the most excellent animal,' because she brings forth three times in the year, she is the most excellent of animals. 'May I increase with a thousandfold increase!' Thereby he implores a blessing: a thousand meaning abundance, he thereby means to say, 'May I obtain abundance!'
3	3	9	With that (text) he gives the she-goat, with that he takes the king ; for agâ (goat) doubtlessmeans the same as âgâ (driving thither ), since it is through her (the she-goat) that he finally drives him (Soma) thither. It is thus in a mystic sense that they call her 'agâ.'
3	3	10	He takes the king, with the text , 'Come to us, a friend, bestowing good friends!' whereby he means to say, 'Come to us, as a kind and propitious one!' Having pushed back the garment on the sacrificer's right thigh, he lays him (Soma) down thereon, with the text, 'Seat thee on Indra's right thigh,'--for he, the sacrificer, is at present Indra : therefore he says, 'Seat thee on Indra's right thigh;'--'willing on the willing,' whereby he means to say, 'beloved on the beloved one;'--'tender on the tender!' whereby he means to say, 'propitious on the propitious one.'
3	3	11	Thereupon he (the sacrificer) assigns (to the Gandharvas) the objects constituting the purchase price for the Soma, with the text, 'O Svâna, Bhrâga, Aṅghâri, Bambhâri, Hasta, Suhasta, Krisânu! these are your wages for Soma: keep them! may they not fail you!' Now those (Gandharvas) are instead of the hearth-mounds--these being the names of the hearth-mounds--it is these very (names) that he thereby has assigned to them .
3	3	12	He now uncovers (his head ); for he who is consecrated becomes an embryo, and embryos are enveloped both in the amnion and the outer membrane: him (the sacrificer or sacrifice) he has now brought forth, and therefore he uncovers himself. Now it is he (Soma ) that becomes an embryo, and therefore he is enveloped, since embryos are, as it were, enveloped both in the amnion and the outer membrane.
3	3	13	He then makes (the sacrificer) say the text , 'Keep me, O Agni, from evil ways! let me share in the right ways.' Now he (Soma) approaches him while he is seated, and when he has come, he rises: thereby he does wrong and breaks the vow. This, then, is his expiation of that (transgression), and thus no wrong is thereby done, and he breaks not the vow: therefore he says, 'Keep me, O Agni, from evil ways! let me share in the right ways!'
3	3	14	Having then taken the king, he rises, with the text, 'With new life, with good life, am I risen after the immortals;' for he who rises after the bought Soma, rises indeed after the immortal: therefore he says,' With new life, with good life, am I risen after the immortals.'
3	3	15	Thereupon he takes the king and goes towards the car, with the text , 'We haveentered upon the path that leadeth to wellbeing, free from danger; whereon he escheweth all haters, and meeteth with good .'
3	3	16	Now, once on a time, the gods, while performing sacrifice, were afraid of an attack from the Asura-Rakshas. They perceived that prayer for a safe journey; and having warded off the evil spirits by means of that prayer, they attained wellbeing in the safe and foeless shelter of that prayer. And so does he now ward off the evil spirits by means of that prayer, and attain wellbeing in the safe and foeless shelter of that prayer. For this reason he says, 'We have entered upon the path that leadeth to well-being, free from danger; whereon he escheweth all haters and meeteth with good.'
3	3	17	They carry him thus , and (afterwards) drive him about on the cart; whereby they exalt him: for this reason they carry the seed on their head (to the field), and bring in (the corn) on the cart.
3	3	18	Now the reason why he buys (the Soma) near water  is that--water meaning sap--he thereby buys Soma sapful; and as to there being gold, he thereby buys him lustrous; and as to there being a cloth, he thereby buys him with his skin; and as to there being a she-goat, he thereby buys him fervid; and as to there being a milch cow, he thereby buys him with the milk to be mixed with him; and as to there being a pair (of kine), he thereby buys him with a mate.--He should buy him with ten (objects), andnot with other than ten, for the virâg consists of ten syllables, and Soma is of virâg nature: therefore he should buy him with ten (objects) and not with other than ten.
3	4	1	In the enclosed space (of the cart)  he (the Adhvaryu) lays down the black deer-skin, with the text , 'Thou art Aditi's skin;' its significance is the same (as before) . Thereon he places him (Soma), with, 'Seat thee on Aditi's seat!' for Aditi being this (earth), and she being indeed a safe resting-place, he thereby places him on that safe resting-place: therefore he says, 'Seat thee on Aditi's seat!'
3	4	2	He then makes (the sacrificer) say, after touching (the Soma), 'The bull hath propped the sky, the welkin .' For, when the gods were spreading the sacrifice, they were afraid of an attack on the part of the Asura-Rakshas. Now by what he says, 'The bull hath propped the sky, the welkin,'thereby they rendered it (the sacrifice or Soma) superior to the deadly shaft .
3	4	3	'He hath measured the breadth of the earth;'--thus he gains through him (Soma) these worlds, for there is no slayer, no deadly shaft for him by whom these worlds have been gained: therefore he says, 'He hath measured the breadth of the earth.'
3	4	4	'As all-ruler hath he taken his seat over all things existing (bhuvana);'--thus he gains through him this All, for there is no slayer, no deadly shaft for him by whom this All has been gained: therefore he says, 'As all-ruler hath he taken his seat over all things existing.'
3	4	5	'Verily, all these are Varuna's ordinances;'--thereby he makes here everything whatsoever obedient to him, and every one that is refractory: therefore he says, 'Verily, all these are Varuna's ordinances.'
3	4	6	Thereupon he wraps (the Soma) up in the Soma-wrapper, lest the evil spirits should touch him. For this one doubtless is an embryo, and hidden (tiras), as it were, are embryos, and hidden also is that (which is) wrapped up;--hidden, as it were, are the gods to men, and hidden is that which is wrapped up: therefore he wraps him up.
3	4	7	He wraps him up, with the text , 'Over the woods he hath stretched the welkin,' for over the woods, over the tops of the trees, that welkin (or air) is indeed stretched;--'strength (hath he laid) into the coursers, milk into the kine,'--strength meansmanliness and the coursers are the men: he thereby bestows manliness upon men; and 'milk into the kine' he says, because this milk is indeed contained in the kine;--'Into the hearts Varuna (hath laid) wisdom, into the homesteads  fire;' for into the hearts that wisdom, the swiftness of thought, has indeed entered; and 'into the homesteads fire' he says, because that fire is in the homesteads, with the people;--'Into the heaven hath he placed the Sun, and Soma upon the rock;' for that sun is indeed placed in the heaven; and 'Soma on the rock' he says, because Soma is in the mountains. This is why he says, 'In the heaven hath he placed the Sun, and Soma upon the rock.'
3	4	8	If there are two deer-skins , he then puts up the other by way of a flag ;--and if there is only one, he cuts off the neck of the deer-skin and puts it up by way of a flag;--with the text , 'Mount thou the eye of Sûrya, the eye-ball of Agni, where thou fliest along with the dappled (horses), shining through the wise (Sûrya).' He thereby places Sûrya (the sun) in front, thinking, 'May Sûrya, in front, ward off the evil spirits!' They now drive (Soma) about on a safe (cart), unmolested by evil spirits.
3	4	9	At the fore-part of the shafts two boards have been put up: between them the Subrâhmanyâ stands and drives. He (Soma), indeed, is too high for (the driver) mounting beside him, for who is worthy of mounting beside him? Therefore he drives while standing between (the boards).
3	4	10	He drives with a palâsa branch. Now when Gâyatrî flew towards Soma , a footless archer aiming at her while she was carrying him off, severed one of the feathers (or leaves, parna), either of Gâyatrî or of king Soma; and on falling down it became a parna (palâsa) tree; whence its name parna. 'May that which was there of the Soma nature, be here also now!' so he thinks, and for this reason he drives with a palâsa branch.
3	4	11	He urges on the two oxen. If they be both black, or if either of them be black, then let him know that it will rain, that Parganya will have abundance of rain that year: such indeed is science.
3	4	12	He (the Adhvaryu) first yokes them, with the text , 'Ye oxen, come hither, patient of the yoke!' for they are indeed oxen, and they are patient of the yoke;--'Let yourselves be yoked, tearless!' for they are now being yoked; and tearless means unscathed;--'not man-slaying,' this means 'not doing wrong;'--'speeding the Brahman,' for they are indeed speeders of the Brahman (worship, or the priests);--'Go ye happily to the sacrificer's dwelling!' this he says in order that the evil spirits may not injure them on the way.
3	4	13	Having then gone round to the back (of thecart) and taken hold of the drag , he says (to the Hotri) , 'Recite to the bought Soma!' or,'--to Soma, now driven about!' whichever way he pleases.
3	4	14	He then makes (the sacrificer ) say the text , 'Thou art gracious unto me, go forth, O Lord of the world--,' for he (Soma) is indeed gracious to him, wherefore he heeds no other but him. Even his (Soma's own) kings  come (tohim) to attend the assembly, and he is the first to salute the kings, for he is gracious. This is why he says, 'Thou art gracious.' 'Go forth, O Lord of the world,' he says, because he (Soma) is the lord of beings. 'To all dwellings,' 'all dwellings' doubtless means the limbs; with reference to his limbs he says this, 'May no prowling enemies meet thee! may no waylayers meet thee! May no malicious wolves meet thee!' this he says lest the evil spirits should meet him on his way.
3	4	15	'Having become a falcon, fly away!' he thereby makes him fly forward after becoming a falcon; for the evil spirits fly not after what is fearful: now he, the falcon, forsooth is the most fearful, the strongest of birds, and as such a one he makes him (Soma) fly forwards when he says, 'Having become a falcon, fly away!'
3	4	16	Now they (can) only hit his body . 'Go to the sacrificer's dwelling,--that is the place prepared for us.' In this there is nothing obscure.
3	4	17	Thereupon he recites the Subrahmanyâ litany. Even as one would say to those for whom he intends to prepare a meal, 'On such and such a day I will prepare a meal for you;' so does he thereby announce the sacrifice to the gods. 'Subrahmanyôm! Subrahmanyôm! Subrahmanyôm!' thus he calls, for the Brahman indeed moves the gods onward. Thrice he says it, because the sacrifice is threefold.
3	4	18	'Come, O Indra!' Indra is the deity of the sacrifice: therefore he says, 'Come, O Indra!' 'Come, O lord of the bay steeds! Ram of Medhâtithi ! Wife of Vrishanasva ! Bestriding buffalo! Lover of Ahalyâ !' Thereby he wishes him joy in those affairs of his.
3	4	19	'O Kausika , Brahman, thou who callest thee Gautama .' Just so has this (formula) been devised in these days by Âruni, to wit, 'thou who callest thee Gautama:' he may say it, if he choose, and if he does not choose, he need not attend to it . 'In so and so many days, to the Soma-feast,' (stating) in how many days from hence the pressing is to be.
3	4	20	'Ye gods and priests, come hither !' This he says to the gods and Brâhmans, because it is of these two, the gods and Brâhmans, that he has need.
3	4	21	Thereupon the Pratiprasthâtri steps up to the front of the hall with the victim for Agni and Soma. Now Agni and Soma have seized him, who consecrates himself, between their jaws, for that consecration-offering above  belongs to Agni and Vishnu, and Vishnu, forsooth, is no other than[paragraph continues] Soma, and the offering is he himself who is consecrated: thus they have seized him between their jaws; and by this victim he now redeems himself .
3	4	22	Now, some take a firebrand from the Âhavanîya, saying, 'Here is Agni, and here is Soma: with these two thus being together we will redeem ourselves.' But let him not do this; for wheresoever these two are, there they are indeed together.
3	4	23	It (the victim) is two-coloured, because it belongs to two deities: 'For the sake of concord between the two deities let it be a black-spotted (buck)!' they say; 'for that is most like those two (gods).' If he be unable to obtain a black-spotted buck, it may be a red-spotted one.
3	4	24	Thereon he makes (the sacrificer) say ; 'Homage be to the eye of Mitra and Varuna! perform ye diligently this holy service to the god! sing ye unto the far-seeing, god-born light, to Sûrya, the son of the sky!' Thereby he renders homage to it (the victim) and makes it a token of the covenant.
3	4	25	The Adhvaryu then removes the Soma-wrapper. With  'Thou art Varuna's stay,' he props (the cart) with the prop. With 'Ye two are the rest of Varuna's stay,' he pulls out the two wedges. The reason why he says, 'Ye two are the rest of Varuna's stay ,' is that he, the bought Soma, now indeed is of Varuna .
3	4	26	Thereupon four men take up the king's throne; two men, it is true, take it up for the human king, but four take up this for him who rules over everything here.
3	4	27	It is of udumbara wood--udumbara meaning sap and food--for (the sacrificer's) obtainment of sap and food: therefore it is of udumbara wood.
3	4	28	It reaches up to his navel, for it is there that the food settles, and Soma is food: therefore it reaches up to his navel. Moreover, there is the seat of the seed, and Soma is seed: therefore it reaches up to his navel.
3	4	29	He (the Adhvaryu) touches it with, 'Thou art the rightful seat (ritasadanî) of Varuna!' He then spreads on it the black deerskin with, 'Thou art the rightful seat (ritasadanam) of Varuna!' and places him (Soma) thereon with, 'Seat thee on the rightful seat of Varuna!' The reason why he says, 'Seat thee on the rightful seat of Varuna,' is that he (Soma) is now of Varuna's nature.
3	4	30	Thereupon he makes him (king Soma) enter the hall; and in making him enter, he causes (the sacrificer) to say , 'Whatsoever powers of thine they worship with offering, may they all encompass the sacrifice ! Go forth to our dwellings, O Soma, prospering our homes, ever helpful, bestowing abundance of men, not slaying ourmen!' dwellings meaning houses, he thereby means to say, 'Go forth to our houses, kind, propitious, not doing evil.'
3	4	31	Some now pour out a vessel of water beside him, saying that this would be as. one would bring water for a king that has come to him. But let him not do this, for they (who do this) do at the sacrifice what is human, and inauspicious for the sacrifice forsooth is that which is human: let him therefore not pour out water, lest he should do at the sacrifice what is inauspicious.
4	1	1	Verily, the guest-offering is the head of the sacrifice, and the Prâyanîya and Udayanîya are its arms. But the arms are on both sides of the head: therefore those two oblations, the Prâyanîya and Udayanîya, are on both sides of the guest-offering.
4	1	2	Now as to why it is called 'guest-offering.' He, the purchased Soma, truly comes as his (the sacrificer's) guest,--to him (is offered) that (hospitable reception): even as for a king or a Brâhman one would cook a large ox or a large he-goat--for that is human (fare offered to a guest), and the oblation is that of the gods--so he prepares for him that guest-offering.
4	1	3	Here now they say, 'Let him first walk past (Soma) and take out (the material for offering)!' For (they argue) where people do not show respectto a worthy person (arhant) who has come to them, he becomes angry,--and in this way he (Soma) is indeed honoured.
4	1	4	Then only one (of the oxen) is to be unyoked, and the other to be left unyoked ; and thereupon he is to take out (the material for offering): for (they argue) in that one of them is unyoked, thereby he (Soma) has arrived; and in that the other is left unyoked, thereby he is honoured.
4	1	5	Let him, however, not do this but let him take out (the material for offering) only after unyoking (both oxen) and after making (Soma) enter (the hall); for the ways of men are in accordance with those of the gods. And accordingly, in human practice, so long as (a guest) has not unyoked, people do not bring water to him and show him no honour, for so long he has not yet arrived; but when he has unyoked, then they bring him water and show him honour, for then he has indeed arrived: let him therefore take out (the material for offering) only after unyoking and after making (Soma) enter (the hall).
4	1	6	Let him take it out with all speed, for thus he (Soma) is honoured. The housewife holds on to it from behind ; for the sacrificer holds on to him (Soma), while he is driven around, and here his wife does so. Thus they enclose him on the two sides by a (married) couple: and, indeed, wherever aworthy person comes, there all the inmates of the house bestir themselves, for thus he is honoured.
4	1	7	Let him take out (the material) with a different formula from that wherewith (one takes out) any other oblations , since, when he (Soma) is bought, he is bought for one special destination,--for the sovereignty of the metres, for the supreme sovereignty of the metres. The metres act as attendants about him; even as the non-royal king-makers, the heralds and headmen, (attend upon) the king, so do the metres act as attendants about him (Soma).
4	1	8	In no wise, then, is it befitting that he should take out any (material for offering) solely 'for the metres ;' for whenever people cook food for some worthy person , then the attendants about him, the non-royal king-makers, the heralds and headmen, have their share (of the food) assigned to them; after (or along with their master): hence, when he takes out that (oblation to Soma), let him assign the metres a share in it along with (the deity).
4	1	9	He takes it out, with the text , 'Thou art Agni's body,--thee (I take) for Vishnu!' the Gâyatrî is Agni: to Gâyatrî he thus assigns her share.
4	1	10	'Thou art Soma's body,--thee for Vishnu!' Soma is the nobility, and the Trishtubhis the nobility: to Trishtubh he thus assigns her share.
4	1	11	'Thou art the guest's hospitable entertainment ,--thee for Vishnu!' This is his (Soma's) special share: as there is a special share for a chief, so is this his special share apart from the metres.
4	1	12	'Thee for the Soma-bearing falcon! thee for Vishnu!' thereby he assigns to Gâyatrî her share. Because Gâyatrî, in the form of a falcon, carried off Soma from the sky, therefore she is the Soma-bearing falcon: in virtue of that heroic deed he now assigns to her a second share.
4	1	13	'Thee for Agni, the bestower of prosperity! thee for Vishnu!' Prosperity means cattle, and the Gagatî (the moving, living one) means cattle: to Gagatî he thereby assigns her share.
4	1	14	Now as to his taking five times;--the sacrifice is of equal measure with the year, and five seasons there are in the year: the latter he gains in five (divisions);--for this reason he takes five times. And as to his taking it with 'For Vishnu (I take) thee! for Vishnu thee!' it is because he who takes out (material) for the sacrifice, takes it for Vishnu.
4	1	15	It is a sacrificial cake on nine potsherds;--for the guest-offering is the head of the sacrifice, and the Gâyatrî consists of nine syllables : eight (syllables) are those he recites and the sacred syllable  is the ninth; and the Gâyatrî is the fore-part of thesacrifice , and so is that (cake) the fore-part of the sacrifice: therefore it is a cake on nine potsherds.
4	1	16	The enclosing-sticks are of kârshmarya wood (Gmelina Arborea ), for the gods, once upon a time, perceived that one, the kârshmarya, to be the Rakshas-killer among trees. Now, the guest-offering being the head of the sacrifice, the enclosing-sticks are of kârshmarya wood, in order that the evil spirits may not injure the head of the sacrifice.
4	1	17	The prastara-bunch  is of asvavâla-grass (Saccharum Spontaneum). For, once upon a time, the sacrifice escaped from the gods. It became a horse (asva) and sped away from them. The gods, rushing after it, took hold of its tail (vâla) and tore it out; and having torn it out, they threw it down in a lump, and what had been the hairs of the horse's tail then grew up as those plants (of asvavâla-grass). Now the guest-offering is the head of the sacrifice, and the tail is the hind-part (of animals): hence by the prastara being of asvavâla-grass he encompasses the sacrifice on both sides.
4	1	18	There are two vidhritis  of sugar-cane, lestthe barhis and the prastara should become mixed up together. Having then purified the ghee , he takes all the butter-portions in four ladlings , for at this (sacrifice) there are no after-offerings.
4	1	19	When he has placed the sacrificial dishes (on the altar) , he churns the fire. For the guest-offering is the head of the sacrifice; and in churning (the fire) they produce that (sacrifice); and one who is born is born with the head first: hence he thereby makes the sacrifice to be produced with the head first. Further, Agni means all the gods, since offering is made in the fire to all gods; and the guest-offering is the head of the sacrifice: hence, through all the deities, he secures success to the sacrifice from the very head (beginning). This is why he churns the fire .
4	1	20	He takes the bottom piece of wood , with the text , 'Thou art the birth-place of Agni;' for it is thereon that Agni is produced: hence he says, 'Thou art the birth-place of Agni.'
4	1	21	Thereon he lays two sprouts of a kusa stalk (with the tops towards the east), with, 'Ye aremales ;' thereby these two are as two (sons) born together here from a woman.
4	1	22	Thereon he lays the lower churning-stick (with the top to the north), with, 'Thou art Urvasî!' He then touches the (ghee in the) ghee-pan with the upper churning-stick, with, 'Thou art Âyu,' he puts it down (on the lower arani) with, 'Thou art Purûravas.' For Urvasî was a nymph, and Purûravas was her husband; and the (child) which sprung from that union was Âyu : in like manner does he now produce the sacrifice from that union. Thereupon he says (to the Hotri), 'Recite to Agni, as he is churned !'
4	1	23	He churns, with the texts, 'With the Gâyatrî metre I churn thee!--With the Trishtubh metre I churn thee!--With the Gagatî metre I churn thee!' For it is with the metres that he churns him (Agni, the fire); the metres he recites to him when he is churned, whereby he attaches the metres to the sacrifice, even as the rays (are attached) to yonder sun.--'Recite to the born one!' he says,when he (Agni) is produced ; and 'To him who is thrown !' when he throws him (on the old Âhavanîya fire).
4	1	24	He throws (the fire on the hearth), with the text , 'For our sake be ye two (fires) friendly to one another, of one mind, unblemished! Injure not the sacrifice, nor the lord of the sacrifice! be gracious unto us this day, ye knowers of beings!' He thus bespeaks peacefulness between them, that they may not injure each other.
4	1	25	He then takes out some clarified butter with the dipping-spoon, and pours it on the fire, with the text , 'Agni resorteth to Agni, he the son of the seers that shieldeth us from curses: graciously offer thou for us now with good offering, never withholding the oblation from the gods, Hail!' For the purpose of offering they have produced him, and by this offering he has now gratified him: that is why he thus makes offering unto him.
4	1	26	It (the guest-offering) ends with the Idâ; no after-offerings are performed. For the guest-offering is the head of the sacrifice, and the head is the fore-part: he thus fits him up as the head of the sacrifice. But were he to perform the after-offerings, it would be as if, by reversing, he were to put the feet in the place of the head. Hence it ends with the Idâ, and no after-offerings are performed.
4	2	1	When the gods had performed the guest-offering, discord befell them. They separated into four different parties, unwilling to yield to each other's excellence,--Agni, with the Vasus, Soma with the Rudras, Varuna with the Âdityas, and Indra with the Maruts. Brihaspati with the All-gods, say some , but, indeed, those who separated into four parties were 'all the gods.' When they were separated, the Asura-Rakshas came after them and entered between them.
4	2	2	They became aware of it,--'Forsooth, we are in an evil plight, the Asura-Rakshas have come in between us: we shall fall a prey to our enemies. Let us come to an agreement and yield to the excellence of one of us!' They yielded to the excellence of Indra; wherefore it is said, 'Indra is all the deities, the gods have Indra for their chief.'
4	2	3	For this reason let not kinsmen fall out, for any (enemy) of theirs, be he ever so far away, steps in between them; they do what pleases their enemies and fall a prey to their enemies: therefore let them not fall out. For he who, knowing this, quarrels not, does what displeases his enemies andfalls not a prey to his enemies: let him therefore not quarrel.
4	2	4	They said, 'Well then, let us contrive so that this (concord) of ours shall be for ever imperishable!'
4	2	5	The gods laid down together  their favourite forms and desirable powers , one after another, and said, 'Thereby he shall be away from us, he shall be scattered to the winds, whosoever shall transgress this (covenant) of ours!'--Whose (is it) as witness ?'--'Tanûnapât, the mighty!'--Now the mighty Tanûnapât indeed is yonder blowing (wind), he is the witness of living beings, entering thus as the in-breathing and out-breathing.
4	2	6	Wherefore they say, 'The gods know the mind of man.' In his mind he proposes; it passes on to the breath, and the breath to the wind, and the wind tells the gods what the mind of man is.
4	2	7	Hence it was in regard to this what was said by the Rishi, 'In his mind he proposeth, and it goeth on to the wind ; and the wind telleth the gods what thy mind is, O man.'
4	2	8	The gods laid down together their favourite forms and desirable powers, and said, 'Thereby he shall be away from us, he shall be scattered to the winds, whosoever shall transgress this (covenant) of ours!' And even now the gods do not transgress that (covenant), for how would they fare, were theyto transgress it?--they would speak untruth, and verily there is one law which the gods do keep, namely, the truth. It is through this that their conquest, their glory is unassailable: and so, forsooth, is his conquest, his glory unassailable whosoever, knowing this, speaks the truth. Now, the Tânûnaptra is really that same (covenant of the gods).
4	2	9	The gods laid down together their favourite forms and desirable powers. Now it is by taking portions of butter that they (the priests) lay down together the desirable forms and favourite powers. Let him, then, not covenant with any one and every one, lest his favourite forms and desirable powers should be mixed up (with those of others). But let him not deceive one with whom he makes a covenant; for thus it is said, 'Let there be no deceiving of him with whom one has made the covenant of Tanûnapât.'
4	2	10	In the first place he takes (butter) therefrom , with the text , 'For him that rushes onward, for him that rushes about, I take thee.' He that blows yonder (the wind) does indeed rush onward and rush about; and it is for him that he takes (the butter): therefore he says, 'for him that rushes onward, for him that rushes about, I take thee.'
4	2	11	'For Tanûnapât, the mighty.' The mighty Tanûnapât truly is yonder blowing (wind), and it is for him that he takes (the butter): therefore he says, 'For Tanûnapât, the mighty.'
4	2	12	'For the powerful, the most strong!' He is indeed powerful and most strong; and for him he takes it: therefore he says, 'For the powerful, the most strong.'
4	2	13	They then touch it at the same time. Now the gods were fully agreed on this point, 'Verily, so and thus shall he of us fare who shall transgress this (covenant) of ours!' And so are these (priests and sacrificer) now agreed on this,--'Verily, so and thus shall he of us fare who shall transgress this (covenant) of ours!'
4	2	14	They touch it simultaneously, with the text, 'Thou art the strength of the gods, unassailed and unassailable; for the gods were indeed unassailed and unassailable while being together, and speaking with one accord and holding together. 'The strength of the gods' doubtless means the favourite forms and desirable powers of the gods, 'uncursed, curse-averting, uncursable,' for the gods have overcome every curse;--'May I straightway go to the truth!' whereby he means to say, 'May I speak the truth, may I not transgress this (covenant);'--'Establish me in welfare!' for in welfare the gods indeed established themselves by speaking the truth, by performing the truth: therefore he says, 'Establish me in welfare!'
4	2	15	Now those favourite forms and desirable powers which the gods put together, they then deposited in Indra ;--Indra verily is he that burns yonder (the sun); but he indeed did not burn in the beginning, but as now everything else is dark, so was he then; and it is by that very energy (derivedfrom those divine objects) that he burns. Hence, if many persons perform the consecration , let it (the Tânûnaptra butter), after pouring the fast-milk to it, be handed only to the master of the house, since he, among them, is the representative of Indra. And if he perform the consecration by means of an (offering) with a dakshinâ, let them hand it (the butter) to the sacrificer, after pouring the fast-milk to it, for thus it is said,--'The Sacrificer is Indra.'
4	2	16	Now what favourite forms and desirable powers the gods then laid together, all that was wrought together and became the Sâman: wherefore they say, 'The Sâman is the truth, the Sâman is born of the gods.'
4	3	1	When the gods had performed the guest-offering, discord arose between them. They allayed it by means of the Tânûnaptra (oaths). They desired an atonement for having spoken evil to one another; for they had appointed no other consecration-ceremony till the expiatory bath. They perceived this intermediate consecration .
4	3	2	By means of fire they enveloped (the body) with a skin. Now, fire being fervour, and the consecration being fervour, they thereby underwent an intermediate consecration; and because they underwent thatintermediate consecration, therefore this intermediary consecration (avântaradîkshâ, is performed). They turned in their fingers more tightly and drew  their zone tighter, whereby they (again) put round them what had been put round them before ;--and so does he thereby make atonement for what heretofore he has done injurious to the vow, for what he has spoken injurious to the vow.
4	3	3	By means of the fire they (the priests) envelop him with a skin. Now, fire being fervour, and the consecration being fervour, he thereby undergoes an intermediate consecration. He turns in his fingers more tightly and draws the zone tighter, whereby he (again) puts round himself what was put round him before. Moreover, it was offspring the gods thereby obtained.
4	3	4	By means of Agni (fire) they enveloped (the body) with a skin. Now, Agni being the causer of sexual union, the progenitor, they thereby obtained offspring. They turned in their fingers more tightly and drew their zone tighter, whereby they produced offspring for themselves. And in like manner does he (the sacrificer) thereby obtain offspring.
4	3	5	By means of Agni he envelops himself with a skin. Now, Agni being the causer of sexual union, the progenitor, he thereby  obtains offspring. He turns in his fingers more tightly and draws his zone tighter, whereby he produces offspring for himself.
4	3	6	Now, while the gods were consecrated, whichever of them fetched fire-wood or uttered his appointed texts, him the Asura-Rakshas endeavoured tostrike--the one by (assuming) the form of this one, and the other by that of another. They came together, upbraiding one another, saying, 'See, what thou hast clone to me! see, how thou hast struck me!' But Agni alone did not speak thus to any one, nor did any one speak thus to Agni.
4	3	7	They said, 'Have they spoken thus to thee also, Agni?' He said, 'Verily, I have not spoken to any one, nor has any one spoken to me.'
4	3	8	They became aware,--'He verily is the greatest repeller of the Rakshas among us; let us be like him: thereby we shall escape from the Rakshas, thereby we shall attain to the heavenly world.' They accordingly became like Agni, and thereby escaped from the Rakshas and attained to the heavenly world. And in like manner does this one now become like Agni, and thereby escape from the Rakshas and attain to the heavenly world. It is in putting a kindling-stick on (the Âhavanîya fire ) that he enters upon the Avântaradîkshâ.
4	3	9	He puts on the kindling-stick, with the text , 'O Agni, protector of vows; on thee, O protector of vows--' for Agni is lord of vows to the gods; wherefore he says, 'O Agni, protector of vows, on thee, O protector of vows--' 'what bodily form  there is of thine, (may that be) here on me; and what bodily form there is of mine, (may that be) on thee! May my vows be bound up with thine, O lord of vows!' whereby he envelops himself with the skin by means of Agni, 'May the lord of consecration approve myconsecration, and the lord of penance my penance!' Thereby he enters upon the intermediary consecration. More closely he turns in his fingers, and closer he draws the zone; whereby he (again) puts round himself what was put round him before.
4	3	10	They then attend on him with the boiling lustral water (madantî);--fire is heat, and the lustral water is heat: that is why they attend on him with the lustral water.
4	3	11	Having touched the lustral water, they (the priests and sacrificer) therewith strengthen  the king (Soma). The reason why, after touching the lustral water, they strengthen the king is this;--ghee is a thunderbolt, and Soma is seed: hence they strengthen the king after touching the lustral water, lest they should injure the seed, Soma, by the thunderbolt, the ghee.
4	3	12	Here now they say, 'Him, Soma, for whom that strengthening (meal), the guest-offering, is prepared, they ought first to strengthen, and then (ought to be performed) the Avântaradîkshâ, and thereupon the Tânûnaptra.' But let him not do this. For such indeed was the course of the sacrificial performance: discord arose between them (the gods) thereat; they attained to their former tranquillity; then the Avântaradîkshâ and finally the strengthening.
4	3	13	Then as to why they strengthen (Soma). Soma is a god, since Soma (the moon) is in the sky. 'Soma, forsooth, was Vritra; his body is the same as the mountains and rocks: thereon grows that plant called Usânâ,'--so said Svetaketu Auddâlaki;[paragraph continues] 'they fetch it hither and press it; and by means of the consecration and the Upasads, by the Tânûnaptra and the strengthening they make it into Soma.' And in like manner does he now make it into Soma by means of the consecration and the Upasads, by the Tânûnaptra and the strengthening.
4	3	14	'It is bees’ honey,' they say; for bees’ honey means the sacrifice, and the bees that make the honey are no other than the officiating priests; and in like manner as the working-bees make the honey increase, so do they (the priests) thereby strengthen the sacrifice.
4	3	15	By means of the sacrifice the gods gained that supreme authority which they now wield. They spake, 'How can this (world) of ours be made unattainable to men?' Having sipped the sap of the sacrifice, as bees would suck out honey, and having drained the sacrifice and scattered it by means of the sacrificial post, they disappeared; and because they scattered (yopaya) therewith, therefore it is called yûpa (post).
4	3	16	Now this was heard by the Rishis. They collected the sacrifice; and as that sacrifice was collected, so does he collect the sacrifice who is consecrated. The sacrifice is speech: hence he thereby again supplies what part of the sacrifice here has been sucked out and drained.
4	3	17	They strengthen (the Soma), being six :--there are six seasons: having become the seasons, they strengthen it .
4	3	18	They strengthen him with ,[paragraph continues] 'Let stalk after stalk of thine wax strong, O divine Soma!' whereby they strengthen (increase) stalk after stalk of his;--'for Indra, the winner of the ekadhanas ;' Indra indeed is the deity of the sacrifice: therefore he says, 'For Indra, the winner (or bestower) of the ekadhanas.' For verily every one of those stalks swells to fill a hundred or ten  ekadhana cups for the several gods. 'May Indra wax strong for thee, and wax thou strong for Indra!' for Indra is the deity of the sacrifice: he thus strengthens him who is the deity of the sacrifice. By saying, 'Wax thou strong for Indra,' he instils that invigorating draught into him. 'Strengthen us friends with gain and understanding!' 'With gain' he says with reference to what he gains; and 'with understanding' he says with reference to what he recites. 'Mayest thou thrive, O divine Soma, and may I attain to the Soma-feast!' They, the priests and sacrificer, have one prayer in common, 'May we reach the end of the sacrifice!' hence he thereby means to say, 'May I reach the end of the sacrifice!'
4	3	19	Thereupon they make amends on the prastara. For the sacrifice requires a northward attendance;but now they strengthen (Soma) after going, as it were, towards the right (south) ; and, the sacrifice being the fire, they thereby turn their back on the sacrifice and thus do wrong and are cut off from the gods. Now the prastara also is (part of) the sacrifice, and by (touching) it they again get hold of the sacrifice. And this is his expiation of that (transgression); and so no wrong is committed by them and they are not cut off from the gods: for this reason they make amends on the prastara.
4	3	20	Here now they say, 'On the anointed?--let them rather make amends on the unanointed !' They should indeed make amends on the un-anointed (prastara), since anointed it is thrown into the fire.
4	3	21	They make amends  with, 'Desirable treasures (may come) forth for strength and well-being--the right for the right-saying'--wherebyhe means to say, 'the truth for the truth-speaking;'--'Homage be to Heaven and to the Earth!' whereby they make amends to these two, heaven and earth, on whom this All is founded.
4	3	22	Having then picked up the prastara, he says, 'Agnîdh, does the water boil? It boils,' replies the Agnîdh . 'Come hither with it!' He holds (the prastara) quite close over the fire. The reason why he does not throw it into the fire is that he (the sacrificer) is to perform therewith  during the days that follow; and in that he holds it quite close over the fire, thereby it is for him as if it were really thrown into the fire. He hands it to the Agnîdh, and the Agnîdh puts it aside (in a safe place).
4	4	1	Verily the Upasads (homages or sieges) are the neck of the sacrifice, and the Pravargya is its head. Hence when it is performed with the Pravargya ,they perform the Upasads  after performing the Pravargya, and thereby they put the neck in its place.
4	4	2	The anuvâkyâs (invitatory prayers) in the forenoon are the yâgyâs (offering prayers) in the afternoon; and the yâgyâs are the anuvâkyâs . He thus interlinks them, whence those joints and those bones of the neck are interlinked.
4	4	3	Now the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pragâpati, were contending against each other . The Asuras then built themselves castles in these worlds,--an iron one in this world, a silver one in the air, and a golden one in the sky.
4	4	4	The gods then prevailed. They besieged them by these sieges (upasad); and because they besieged (upa-sad) them, therefore the name Upasads.[paragraph continues] They clove the castles and conquered these worlds. Hence they say, 'A castle is conquered by siege;' for it is indeed by beleaguering that one of these human castles is taken.
4	4	5	By means of these sieges, then, the gods clove the castles and conquered these worlds. And so does this one (the sacrificer) now,--no one, it is true, builds for himself castles against him in this world; he cleaves these same worlds, he conquers these worlds: therefore he offers with the Upasads.
4	4	6	They have clarified butter for their offering material. For ghee is a thunderbolt, and by that thunderbolt, the ghee, the gods clove the strongholds and conquered these worlds. And so does he cleave these worlds by that thunderbolt, the ghee, and conquer these worlds; therefore they (the Upasads) have ghee for their offering material.
4	4	7	He takes eight times (ghee) in the guhû, and four times in the upabhrit; or conversely, they say, he is to take of it only four times in the guhû and eight times in the upabhrit .
4	4	8	He takes eight times in the guhû, and four times in the upabhrit. He thereby makes the thunderbolt heavy in front, and with that thunderbolt heavy in front he cleaves these worlds, and conquers these worlds.
4	4	9	Agni and Soma verily are yoke-fellows among the gods: for these two he takes (ghee) in common . For Vishnu (he takes) singly. He makes only the one libation (âghâra) which (he makes) with the dipping-spoon (sruva) . For when he has madethe northern (higher) libation he retires : 'May I conquer for conquest' so he thinks, and therefore he makes only the one libation, that with the dipping-spoon.
4	4	10	When he has called on the Âgnîdhra) for the Sraushat,-- he does not elect the Hotri . 'Seat thee, O Hotri!' he says. The Hotri sits down on the Hotri's seat. Having sat down he urges the Adhvaryu; and he, thus urged, takes the two offering-spoons .
4	4	11	While passing over (to the south side of the fire and altar) he says  (to the Hotri), 'Recite the invitatory prayer to Agni!' and having called for the Sraushat, he says, 'Pronounce the offering prayer to Agni!' and pours out the oblation when the Vashat is uttered.
4	4	12	Thereupon he says, 'Recite the invitatory prayer to Soma!' and having called for the Sraushat, he says, 'Pronounce the offering prayer to Soma!' and pours out the oblation when the Vashat is uttered.
4	4	13	Thereupon, while pouring the ghee which is in the upabhrit , together (with what is left in the guhû), he says, 'Recite the invitatory prayer to Vishnu!' and, having called for the Sraushat, he says, 'Pronounce the offering prayer to Vishnu!'and pours out the oblation when the Vashat is uttered.
4	4	14	The reason why in offering he remains standing in one and the same place, and does not move about as he is wont to do here in performing, is that he thinks 'I will conquer for conquest !' And the reason why he offers to those deities is that he thereby constructs the thunderbolt: Agni (he makes) the point (anîka), Soma the barb (salya), and Vishnu the connecting piece (kulmala) .
4	4	15	For the thunderbolt is the year the day is Agni, the night Soma, and what is between the two, that is Vishnu. Thus he makes the revolving year.
4	4	16	The thunderbolt is the year: by that year, as a thunderbolt, the gods clove the strongholds and conquered these worlds. And so does he now by that year, as a thunderbolt, cleave these worlds, and conquer these worlds. This is why he offers to those gods.
4	4	17	Let him undertake three Upasads; for, there being three seasons in the year, it is thereby made of the form of the year: he thus makes up the year. He performs twice each.
4	4	18	These amount to six; for, there being six seasons in the year, it is thereby made of the form of the year: he thus makes up the year.
4	4	19	And should he undertake twelve Upasads,--there being twelve months in the year, it is thereby made of the form of the year: he thus makes up the year. He performs twice each.
4	4	20	These amount to twenty-four;--there being twenty-four half-moons in the year, it is thereby made of the form of the year: he thus makes up the year.
4	4	21	As to his performing in the evening and in the morning,--it is because only thus completeness is obtained. When he performs in the forenoon, then he gains the victory;--and when he performs in the afternoon, he does so that it may be a good (complete) victory;--and when he offers the Homa, (it is as if) people fight here for a stronghold, and having conquered it, they enter it as their own.
4	4	22	When he performs (the upasads), he fights; and when (the performance) is completed, he conquers; and when he offers the Homa , he enters that (stronghold) now his own.
4	4	23	He offers it (with the verse) with which hewill have to perform twice in one day  , 'What most excellent iron-clad body is thine, O Agni, established in the deep, it hath chased away the cruel word, it hath chased away the fearful word; Hail!' for such-like it was, it was indeed iron.
4	4	24	Again he offers (with the verse) with which he will have to perform twice in one day, 'What most excellent silver-clad body is thine, O Agni, established in the deep, it hath chased away the cruel word, it hath chased away the fearful word; Hail!' for such-like it was, it was indeed silver.
4	4	25	And again he offers (with the verse) with which he will have to perform twice in one day, 'What most excellent gold-clad body is thine, O Agni, established in the deep, it hath chased away the cruel word, it hath chased away the fearful word; Hail!' for such-like it was, it was indeed golden. If he undertakes twelve Upasads, let him perform each of them for four days.
4	4	26	Now then of the fast-homages. Some Upasads get wider and wider, others narrower and narrower: those at which he milks out one (teat)  on the first day, then two, and then three, are those that get wider and wider; and those at which hemilks out three on the first day, then two, and then one, are those that get narrower and narrower. Those getting narrower and narrower are (as good as) those getting wider and wider; and those getting wider and wider are (as good as) those getting narrower and narrower.
4	4	27	Verily, the world is conquered by austere devotion. Now, his devotion becomes ever and ever wider, he conquers an ever and ever more glorious world and becomes better even in this world, whosoever, knowing this, undertakes the Upasads that get narrower and narrower : let him, therefore, undertake the Upasads that get narrower and narrower. And should he undertake twelve Upasads, let him have three (teats) milked out for four days, two for four days, and one for four days.
5	1	1	From that post which is the largest on the east side (of the hall)  he now strides three steps forwards (to the east), and there drives in a peg,--this is the intermediate (peg) .
5	1	2	From that middle peg he strides fifteen steps to the right, and there drives in a peg,--this is the right hip.
5	1	3	From that middle peg he strides fifteen steps northwards, and there drives in a peg,--this is the left hip.
5	1	4	From that middle peg he strides thirty-six steps eastwards, and there drives in a peg,--this is the fore-part .
5	1	5	From that middle peg (in front) he strides twelve steps to the right, and there drives in a peg, this is the right shoulder.
5	1	6	From that middle peg he strides twelve steps to the north, and there drives in a peg,--this is the left shoulder. This is the measure of the altar.
5	1	7	Now the reason why it is thirty steps broad behind is this: the Virâg metre consists of thirty syllables, and by means of the Virâg the gods obtained a firm footing in this world; and even so does he now, by means of the Virâg, obtain a firm footing in this world.
5	1	8	But there may also be thirty-three (steps); for of thirty-three syllables also consists the Virâg; and by means of the Virâg, he obtains a firm footing in this world.
5	1	9	Then as to why the 'easterly line ' is thirty-six steps long;--the Brihatî consists of thirty-six syllables, and by means of the Brihatî the gods obtainedthe heavenly world: and so does he now, by means of the Brihatî, obtain the heavenly world and that offering-fire (Âhavanîya) of his is in the sky.
5	1	10	And as to (the altar) being twenty-four steps broad in front;--the Gâyatrî consists of twenty-four syllables, and the Gâyatrî is the fore-part of the sacrifice: this is why it is twenty-four steps broad in front. This is the measure of the altar.
5	1	11	And why it is broader behind,--'Wider behind, broad-hipped,' thus they praise a woman. And by its being wider behind, he makes that womb at the hind-part (of the altar) wider, and from that wider womb these creatures are born.
5	1	12	That high altar (Uttaravedi ) is the nose of the sacrifice; because they throw it up so as to be higher than the altar, therefore it is called 'high altar.'
5	1	13	Now, in the beginning there were two kinds of beings here, the Âdityas and the Aṅgiras. The Aṅgiras then were the first to prepare a sacrifice, and having prepared the sacrifice they said to Agni, 'Announce thou to the Âdityas this our to-morrow's Soma-feast, saying, "Minister ye at this sacrifice of ours!"'
5	1	14	The Âdityas spake (to one another), 'Contrive ye how the Aṅgiras shall minister unto us, and not we unto the Aṅgiras!'
5	1	15	They said, 'Verily by nothing but sacrifice is there a way out of this : let us undertake another[paragraph continues] Soma-feast!' They brought together the (materials for) sacrifice, and having made ready the sacrifice, they said, 'Agni, thou hast announced to us a Soma-feast for to-morrow; but we announce to thee and the Aṅgiras a Soma-feast even for to-day: it is for us that thou art (to officiate as) Hotri !'
5	1	16	They sent back some other (messenger) to the Aṅgiras; but the Aṅgiras going after Agni, were exceeding angry with him, saying, 'Going as our messenger, why didst thou not mind us ?'
5	1	17	He spake, 'The blameless chose me: as the chosen of the blameless, I could not go away.' And let not therefore the chosen (priest) of a blameless man turn away from him. The Aṅgiras then officiated for the Âdityas in the sacrifice with Soma bought (krî) on the same day (sadyas); whence this Sadyahkrî .
5	1	18	They brought Vâk (speech) to them for their sacrificial fee. They accepted her not, saying, 'We shall be losers if we accept her.' And so the performance of that sacrifice was not discharged (completed), as it was one requiring a sacrificial fee.
5	1	19	Thereupon they brought Sûrya (the sun) to them, and they accepted him. Wherefore the Aṅgiras say, 'Verily, we are fit for the sacrificial office, we are worthy to receive Dakshinâs; yea, even he that burns yonder has been received by us !'[paragraph continues] Hence a white horse is the sacrificial fee for the Sadyahkrî.
5	1	20	On the front of this (horse) there is a golden ornament, whereby it is made an image of him that burns yonder.
5	1	21	Now Vâk was angry with them: 'In what respect, forsooth, is that one better than I,--wherefore is it, that they should have accepted him and not me ?' So saying she went away from them. Having become a lioness she went on seizing upon (everything ) between those two contending parties, the gods and the Asuras. The gods called her to them, and so did the Asuras. Agni was the messenger of the gods, and one Saharakshas for the Asura-Rakshas.
5	1	22	Being willing to go over to the gods, she said, 'What would be mine, if I were to come over to you?'--'The offering shall reach thee even before (it reaches) Agni.' She then said to the gods, 'Whatsoever blessing ye will invoke through me, all that shall be accomplished unto you!' So she went over to the gods.
5	1	23	And, accordingly, when he pours ghee on the high altar , while the fire is held (over it)--since the gods said to her on that occasion, 'The offering shall reach thee even before Agni'--then that offering does reach her even before (it reaches) Agni; for this (high altar) is in reality Vâk. And when he raisesthe high altar, it is for the completeness of the sacrifice, for the sacrifice is Vâk (speech) and that (high altar) is Vâk.
5	1	24	He measures it with the yoke and pin;--namely with the yoke (that place) whither they take (the earth); and with a yoke-pin that, from whence they take (the earth ), for the team is harnessed with the yoke and the pin: it is because she (Vâk), as a lioness, at that time roamed about unappeased that he thus yokes her here at the sacrifice.
5	1	25	One must not therefore accept a Dakshinâ (sacrificial fee) that has been refused (by another priest ), for, having turned into a lioness, it destroys him;--nor must he (the sacrificer) take it home again, for, having turned into a lioness, it destroys him;--nor must he give it to any one else, as he would thereby make over the sacrifice to some one other than himself. Hence if he have any wretched kinsman, let him give it to him; for in that he gives it away, it will not turn into a lioness and destroy him; and in that he gives it to a kinsman, he does not make over (the sacrifice) to one other than himself: and this is the settling of a refused Dakshinâ.
5	1	26	He now takes the yoke-pin and the wooden sword; and from where the northern peg of the front side is, he strides three steps backwards and there marks off the pit (kâtvâla). The measure for the pit is the same (as for the high altar) ; thereis no (other) measure in regard to it: wherever he himself may think fit in his mind (to fix it), in front of the heap of rubbish (utkara), there let him mark off the pit.
5	1	27	From the (north) edge of the altar he lays down the pin from south to north, and draws the (western) outline, with the text , 'Thou art for me the resort of the afflicted!' Thereby he means this (earth), for it is thereon that he walks afflicted.
5	1	28	Thereupon he lays down the pin in front from south to north, and draws the outline with, 'Thou art my wealth-resort.' Thereby he means this (earth), for it is thereon that he walks having acquired (wealth).
5	1	29	He then lays down the pin along the (north) edge of the altar from west to east, and draws the outline with, 'Preserve me from being in want !' Thereby he means this (earth): 'Wherever there is want, from that preserve me!'
5	1	30	He then lays down the pin on the north side from west to east, and draws the outline with, 'Preserve me from being afflicted !' Thereby hemeans this (earth): 'wherever there is affliction, from that preserve me!'
5	1	31	He then flings (the wooden sword) ; at the place where he flings , the Agnîdh sits. He flings while mentioning the names of the Agnis . For those (three) Agnis whom the gods at first chose for the office of Hotri passed away: they crept into these very earths,--namely, into this one and the two beyond it. It is really with this one  that he now flings.
5	1	32	He flings with the texts, 'May the Agni called Nabhas  know (thee)! Go thou, O Agni, Aṅgiras, with the name of Âyu (life)!' What life they passed away from  that he bestows, that he re-animates. Having with, 'Thou who art in this earth,' taken (the loose soil dug up by the wooden sword), he puts it down (on the altar ), with, 'Whatever inviolate, holy name of thine,therewith I lay thee down!' whereby he means to say, 'whatever holy name, unviolated by the Rakshas, is thine, thereby I lay thee down .'--With 'Thee, moreover, for the delight of the gods,' he takes (earth) a fourth time ; whereby he means to say, 'I take thee well-pleasing to the gods.' He takes that (high altar) from a quadrangular pit, for there are four quarters: thus he takes it from all the four quarters.
5	1	33	Thereupon he shifts (the earth) asunder, with the text , 'Thou art a lioness, overcoming the enemies; be thou meet for the gods!' Inasmuch as, on that occasion, she became a lioness and roamed about unappeased, therefore he says to her, 'Thou art a lioness;' and by 'overcoming the enemies' he means to say, 'Through thee may we worst our enemies.' 'Be thou meet for the gods' he says, because the high altar is a woman: her he thus renders meet for the gods.
5	1	34	He makes it on each side either of the size of the yoke, or ten feet of the sacrificer's ; for the[paragraph continues] Virâg consists of ten syllables, and the Virâg is speech, and the sacrifice is speech. In the middle  he makes, as it were, a navel, thinking, 'Seated in one and the same place, I shall sprinkle (ghee) all round .'
5	1	35	He sprinkles it with water: inasmuch as, on that occasion, she became a lioness and roamed about unappeased--water being (a means of) appeasement--he appeases her with water. And, the high altar being a woman, he thereby fits her for the gods: this is why he sprinkles it with water.
5	1	36	He sprinkles it with, 'Thou art a lioness, overcoming the enemies: get thee pure for the gods!' He then bestrews it with gravel. Now gravel certainly is an ornament, because gravel is rather shining. And that gravel being the ashes of Agni Vaisvânara, he is now about to place Agni thereon, and so Agni does not injure it: this is why he bestrews it with gravel. He bestrews it with, 'Thou art a lioness, overcoming the enemies: array thee for the gods!' He then covers it , and thus covered it remains during that night.
5	2	1	They put fire-wood on (the Âhavanîya fire), and prepare the underlayer (of gravel ). He (the Adhvaryu) puts the butter on (the Gârhapatya to melt), and cleans both the dipping-spoon and the offering-spoon. Having then clarified the ghee, he ladles five times thereof (into the offering-spoon). When the fire-wood is ablaze-
5	2	2	They lift the (burning) fire-wood, and place it on the underlayer . Thereupon he says (to the Hotri), 'Recite for Agni as he is taken forward !' (and to the Pratiprasthâtri), 'Come up after me with the single sword(-line)!' The Pratiprasthâtri goes up after him with the single sword(-line) as faras that middle peg on the hind-part of the altar : whatever part of the Gârhapatya  is cut off from the altar by that intermediate (peg), that he thereby carries on to (connects with) it.
5	2	3	Now some walk up behind (and draw a line) as far as the high altar; but let him not do that: let him walk up only as far as that middle peg. They proceed and come up to the high altar .
5	2	4	The Adhvaryu takes the sprinkling-water. He first sprinkles (the high altar) in front, while standing (south of it) facing the north, with the text , 'May Indra's noise  shield thee in front with the Vasus!' whereby he means to say, 'May Indra's noise protect thee in front with the Vasus.'
5	2	5	He then sprinkles it behind with, 'May the Wise  shield thee from behind with the Rudras!' whereby he means to say, 'May the Wise One protect thee from behind with the Rudras!'
5	2	6	He then sprinkles on the right (south) side with, 'May the Thought-swift shield thee with the Fathers on the right!' whereby he meansto say, 'May he swift as thought  protect thee on the right with the Fathers!'
5	2	7	He then sprinkles on the left side with, 'May Visvakarman (the All-shaper) shield thee with the Âdityas on the left!' whereby he means to say, 'May Visvakarman protect thee on the left with the Âdityas!'
5	2	8	The sprinkling-water which is left he pours outside the altar close to where is the southern of those two front corners (of the high altar) with, 'This burning water I dismiss from the sacrifice.' Because she (Vâk--the altar) on that occasion became a lioness and roamed about unappeased , he thus dismisses from the sacrifice that sorrow of hers,--if he do not wish to exorcise. But should he wish to exorcise, let him indicate it by saying, 'This burning water I dismiss from the sacrifice against so and so!' He then smites him with that sorrow, and sorrowing he goes to yonder world.
5	2	9	Now as to why he pours ghee on the high altar, while the fire is held (over it). Because the gods said to her on that occasion, 'The offering shall reach thee before Agni,' therefore the offering now does reach her before (it reaches) Agni. And because she said to the gods, 'Whatsoever blessing ye will invoke through me, all that shall be accomplished unto you!' therefore the priests now invoke through her that blessing upon the sacrificer, and it is fully accomplished unto him.
5	2	10	When he pours ghee on the high altar, hedoes it twofold even while doing it in one . Now that which is the southern of the two front corners of that navel, so to say, which is in the middle of these (sides of the high altar)--
5	2	11	On that  he pours ghee, with the text , 'Thou art a lioness; Hail!' Then on the northern of the two back corners with, 'Thou art a lioness, winning the Âdityas , Hail!' Then on the southern of the two back corners with, 'Thou art a lioness, winning the Brahman, winning the Kshatra, Hail!' Manifold, verily, is the prayer for blessing in the sacrificial texts: by this one he prays  for the Brahman (priesthood) and the Kshatra. (nobility), those two vital forces.
5	2	12	Then on the northern of the front corners with, 'Thou art a lioness, winning abundant offspring, winning growth of wealth, Hail!' In that he says, 'winning abundant offspring,' he prays for offspring; and in that he says, 'winning growth of wealth'--growth of wealth meaning abundance--he prays for abundance.
5	2	13	He then pours ghee into the middle with, 'Thou art a lioness, bring thou hither the gods for the sacrificer! Hail!' whereby he causes the gods to be brought to the sacrificer. He then raises the offering-spoon with, 'To thebeings thee! Hail!'--beings meaning offspring--he thereby means to say, 'To offspring thee!'
5	2	14	He then lays the enclosing-sticks  round (the navel); with the text , 'Thou art firm, steady thou the earth!' the middle one; with, 'Thou art firmly settled, steady thou the air!' the right one; with, 'Thou art immovably settled, steady thou the sky!' the left one. With, 'Thou art Agni's provision' he throws the 'equipments' upon (the high altar). Wherefore are the equipments?--for Agni's completeness.
5	2	15	The pine-wood, namely, is his body : hence in that there are enclosing-sticks of pine-wood, thereby he supplies him with a body, makes him whole.
5	2	16	And the bdellium, forsooth, is his flesh: hence in that there is bdellium, thereby he supplies him with flesh, makes him whole.
5	2	17	And the fragrant reed-grass (sugandhi-tegana), forsooth, is his fragrance: hence in that there is fragrant reed-grass, thereby he supplies him with fragrance, makes him whole.
5	2	18	And as to why there is a wether's hair-tuft,--Agni, forsooth, dwelt once for one night between the two horns of a wether: 'Whatever of Agni's nature is inherent therein, let that be here too,' so he thinks, and therefore there is a wether's hair-tuft. Let him, therefore, cut off that (tuft) which is nearest to the head, and bring it; and if he be unable to procure that, let him bring any kind (of wether's hair). And why there are enclosing-sticks?--for theprotection (of Agni): for it is somewhat long before the next enclosing-sticks will come nigh to him .
5	3	1	The sacrifice is a man; it is a man for the reason that a man spreads (prepares) it. In being spread it is made just as large  as a man: this is why the sacrifice is a man.
5	3	2	The Soma-cart (shed) is no other than his head, and has Vishnu for its deity . And because Soma is therein--Soma being havis (material for offering) for the gods--therefore it is called Havirdhâna (receptacle of havis).
5	3	3	The Âhavanîya is no other than his mouth: hence, when he offers on the Âhavanîya, it is as if he poured (food) into the mouth.
5	3	4	The sacrificial stake is no other than his crest-lock; and the Âgnîdhrîya and Mârgâlîya  are his arms.
5	3	5	The Sadas  (tent for the priests) is no other than his belly: wherefore they feed in the Sadas, for whatever food is eaten here on earth all that settles down here in the belly. And because all the gods sat (sad) in it therefore it is called Sadas: and so do these Brahmans of every family now sit therein.
5	3	6	And the two fires which are behind  it are his feet. In being spread it is made just as large as a man: this is why the sacrifice is a man.
5	3	7	The cart-shed has doors on both sides; and so has the Sadas doors on both sides: hence this man is perforated from one end to the other. He steps to the Soma-carts when they have been -washed down.
5	3	8	They turn them round, the southern one on the south side, and the northern one on the north side . The larger of the two should be the southern (or right) one .
5	3	9	Over them, having been turned round (and placed on the altar), they put a mat of reed-grass; or, if he cannot procure a reed-mat, a frame of split canemade in like manner as a reed-mat. They fasten a front-band (to the posts of the front door ). They enclose (the carts) within two upright hurdles; and lay a (second) reed-mat, or a frame of split cane made in like manner as a reed-mat, behind (the first mat ).
5	3	10	Now , having again entered (the hall), andtaken ghee in four ladlings, he makes offering to Savitri for his impulsion, for Savitri is the impeller (prasavitri) of the gods: 'We will perform the sacrifice, for one impelled by Savitri,' thus (the priest thinks and) therefore he makes offering to Savitri.
5	3	11	He offers with the text , 'They harness the mind and they harness the thoughts'--with the mind and with speech they truly perform the sacrifice. When he says, 'They harness the mind,' he harnesses the mind; and when he says, 'and they harness the thoughts (dhî),' he harnesses speech; for it is thereby  that people seek to make their living in accordance with their respective intelligence (dhî), either by reciting (the Veda), or by readiness of speech, or by songs,--with these two thus harnessed they perform the sacrifice.
5	3	12	'The priests of the priest, of the great inspirer of devotion,'--the learned Brâhmans versed in sacred writ, truly, are the priests: it is regarding them that he says this. And 'of the great inspirer of devotion ,'--the great inspirer of devotion, truly, is the sacrifice: it is regarding the sacrifice that he says this. 'The knower of rites alone hath assigned the priestly offices,' for, in performingthe sacrifice, they indeed assign the priestly offices. 'Great is the praise of the divine Savitri; Hail!' Thus he offers to Savitri for his impulsion.
5	3	13	Having then taken ghee a second time in four ladlings, he walks out (of the hall by the front door). The (sacrificer's) wife is led out by the south door. He then lays down a piece of gold in the right wheel-track of the southern Sonia-cart, and offers thereon, with , 'Vishnu strode through this(universe),thrice he put down his foot: it is enveloped in his dust; Hail!' The residue (of ghee) he pours into the wife's hand. She anoints the burning (part) of the axle  with , 'Audible to the gods, announce ye unto the gods!' He hands to his assistant both the offering-spoon and the melting-pot. They lead the wife round by the back of the two fires .
5	3	14	Having taken ghee in four ladlings, the assistant lays down a piece of gold in the right wheel-track of the northern Soma-cart, and offers thereon, with , 'Be ye too abundant in food and milch kine and pastures, through benevolence to man! Thou proppedst asunder these two worlds, O Vishnu; with beams of light didst thou hold fast  the earth on all sides; Hail!' The residue (of ghee) he pours into the wife's hand. She anoints the burning (part) of the axle with,[paragraph continues] 'Audible to the gods, announce ye unto the gods!' Then as to why he thus offers.
5	3	15	Now, once on a time, the gods, while performing sacrifice, were afraid of an attack on the part of the Asura-Rakshas; and, the ghee being a thunderbolt, they kept off the evil spirits from the south by that thunderbolt, the ghee; and thus they came not after them on their way. And in like manner does he now keep off the evil spirits from the south by that thunderbolt, the ghee; and thus they do not come after him on his way. And the reason why he offers with two verses relating to Vishnu, is that the Soma-cart belongs to Vishnu.
5	3	16	And in that the wife anoints the burning (part) of the axle, thereby a productive union is effected; for when woman and man become heated, the seed flows, and thereupon birth takes place. She anoints in a direction away (from the cart), for away the seed is cast. He then says (to the Hotri), 'Recite to the Soma-carts as they are wheeled forward !'
5	3	17	He makes (the sacrificer) say, 'Go ye both forward, furthering the cult!' The cult, namely, is the sacrifice: 'go ye both forward, furthering the sacrifice' he thereby means to say. 'Convey ye the sacrifice upward; lead it not astray !' whereby he means to say, 'convey this sacrifice upward to the world of the gods;' and by saying 'lead it not astray,' he prays for this (sacrificer) that he may notstumble. Let them wheel (the carts) forward, as it were lifting them, so that they may not creak; for of the Asuras is that voice which is in the axle : 'Lest the Asuras’ voice should speak here!' so he thinks. But if they should creak,--
5	3	18	Let him make (the sacrificer) say this, 'Speak ye unto your own cow-pen, ye divine resorts; speak not my life away, speak not my offspring away!' This, then, is the expiation thereof.
5	3	19	As to this they say, 'Let him stride three steps from the high altar westward and make the Soma-carts stop there: this is the measure for the Soma-carts.' But there is no (fixed) measure in this; wherever he himself may think fit in his mind, only not too near , nor too far (from the high altar), there let him stop them.
5	3	20	He salutes them with, 'May ye rejoice here on the height of the earth!' for this (altar) is verily the height  (top) of the earth, since his offering-fire is in the heaven. He makes them rest on their naves  for that is the appearance of repose.
5	3	21	The Adhvaryu, having gone round along the north side (of the carts), props the southern cart, with , 'Now will I declare the heroic deeds of Vishnu, who measured out the earthly regions; who propped the upper seat, striding thrice, the wide-stepping! For Vishnu (I prop) thee!' He fixes the prop in a different place from where (it is fixed) in ordinary practice .
5	3	22	The assistant then props the northern cart, with , 'Either from the heaven, O Vishnu, or from the earth, or from the great, wide airy region, O Vishnu, fill both thine hands with wealth and bestow on us from the right and the left! For Vishnu thee!' He fixes the prop in a different place from where (it is fixed) in ordinary practice. The reason why he performs with prayers to Vishnu is that the Soma-cart belongs to Vishnu.
5	3	23	He then makes (the sacrificer) say, after touching the middle reed-mat  , 'Let Vishnu then be praised for his power, terrible like a wild beast prowling about the mountains, on whose three wide strides all beings abide!' Now that (mat-covering) indeed is his (Vishnu, the shed's) upper skull-bone for thereon, as it were, the other skull-bones rest: this is why he says 'they abide on.'
5	3	24	Thereupon he makes him say, after touching the front-band , 'Thou art Vishnu's fillet;' for it indeed is his fillet. He then makes him say, after touching the two upright hurdles, 'Ye are the corners of Vishnu's mouth;' for they indeed are the corners of his mouth. Then that mat which is behind there, that indeed is that skull-bone of his here behind (viz. the occiput).
5	3	25	With 'Thou art Vishnu's sewer ,' he sews (the hurdles to the four door posts) with cord by means of a wooden pin. With, 'Thou art Vishnu's fixed (point) ,' he then makes a knot, 'lest it should fall asunder.' That same (knot) he undoes when the work is completed; and thus disease  befalls not either the Adhvaryu or the Sacrificer. The completed (cart-shed) he touches with, 'Thou art Vishnu's own,' for the Soma-cart (and shed) belongs to Vishnu.
5	4	1	It is for a twofold reason that the sounding-holes are dug. The cart-shed, truly, is the head of the sacrificer; and what four holes there are here in the head--namely, these two and these two --those he thereby makes: for this reason he digs the sounding-holes.
5	4	2	Now the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pragâpati, were contending. The Asuras then by way of witchcraft buried charms  within these worlds, thinking, 'Peradventure we may thus overcome the gods.'
5	4	3	The gods then prevailed. By means of these (sounding-holes) they dug up those magic charms. Now, when a charm is dug up, it becomes inoperative and useless. And in like manner, if any malicious enemy buries here charms by way of witchcraft for this (sacrificer), does he thereby dig them up; this is why he digs sounding-holes. He digs just beneath the fore-part of the shafts of the southern cart.
5	4	4	He takes up the spade , with the text ,[paragraph continues] 'At the impulse of the divine Savitri, I take thee with the arms of the Asvins, with the hands of Pûshan: thou art a woman.' The significance of this formula is the same (as before). That spade (abhri, fem.) is indeed a female: therefore he says 'thou art a woman.'
5	4	5	He draws their outlines, saving  the measure of a span, with, 'Here do I cut off the necks of the Rakshas!' For the spade is the thunderbolt: it is with the thunderbolt that he thus cuts off the necks of the Rakshas.
5	4	6	Let him first mark off the right (southern) one of the two that are in front; then the left one of the two behind; then the right one of those behind; then the left one of those in front.
5	4	7	But they say conversely, that he should mark off first the left one of the two behind; then the right one of those in front; then the right one of those behind; and then the left one of those in front. Or he may also mark them off in one and the same direction : but let him, in any case, mark off last of all the one which is on the left of those in front.
5	4	8	He digs them, in the very same order in which they have been marked off, with, 'Thou art great,of great sound!'--he praises and extols them, when he says, 'Thou art great, of great sound;'--'Utter thou the great voice unto Indra!'--Indra, forsooth, is the deity of the sacrifice; and the cart-shed belonging to Vishnu, he thereby makes it to be connected with Indra: therefore he says, 'Utter thou the great voice unto Indra!'
5	4	9	'The Rakshas-killing, charm-killing (voice),' for it is indeed for the killing of the charms of the Rakshas that these (holes) are dug;--'Of Vishnu;' for that voice in the cart-shed is indeed Vishnu's.
5	4	10	He throws out (the earth from) them in the order in which he has dug them, with , 'Here do I cast out the charm which the alien, which the inmate of my house has buried for me!' Either an alien or an inmate of his house buries charms by way of witchcraft: these he thereby casts out.
5	4	11	'Here do I cast out the charm which my equal, which my unequal has buried for me!' Either one equal, or one unequal, to him buries charms by way of witchcraft: these he thereby casts out.
5	4	12	'Here do I cast out the charm which the kinsman, which the stranger has buried for me!' Either a kinsman or a stranger buries charms by way of witchcraft: these he thereby casts out.
5	4	13	'Here do I cast out the charm which the countryman, which the foreigner has buried for me!' Either a countryman or a foreigner buries charms by way of witchcraft: these he thereby casts out. With 'I cast out witchcraft!' he finallythrows out (the earth remaining in the several holes ), whereby he casts out witchcraft.
5	4	14	Let him dig them arm-deep; for that being the end (extreme limit to which he can reach) he thereby in the end brings witchcraft to naught. He connects them crossways by (underground) channels ; or, if he cannot crossways, he may do so in one and the same direction. This is why these (openings of the) vital airs are connected by channels farther (inside).
5	4	15	In the same order in which he has dug them he makes (the sacrificer) touch them, with the texts , 'Self-ruling thou art, a slayer of enemies! Ever-ruling thou art, a slayer of haters! Man-ruling thou art, a slayer of Rakshas! All-ruling thou art, a slayer of foe-men!' This is the blessing of that work: he thereby invokes a blessing.
5	4	16	The Adhvaryu and Sacrificer then touch one another (with their right hands through the holes), the Adhvaryu is at the right one of those in front, and the Sacrificer at the left one of those behind. The Adhvaryu asks, 'Sacrificer, what is here?'--'Happiness!' he says.--'(Be) that ours in common!' says the Adhvaryu in a low voice.
5	4	17	Thereupon the Adhvaryu is at the right one of those behind, and the Sacrificer at the left one of those in front. The Sacrificer asks, 'Adhvaryu, what is here?'--'Happiness!' he says.--'(Be) that mine!' says the Sacrificer. Now in that they thustouch one another, thereby they make the vital airs yoke-fellows: hence these vital airs meet together farther (inside). And in that, when asked, he replies, 'Happiness (bhadram),' thereby he utters the wish of 'prosperity (kalyânam)' of ordinary speech: that is why, being asked, he replies, 'Happiness.' Thereupon he sprinkles (the holes with water): one and the same forsooth is the significance of sprinkling; he thereby renders them pure.
5	4	18	He sprinkles, with the text , 'You, the Rakshas-killers, the charm-killers;' for they are indeed Rakshas-killers as well as charm-killers; 'Vishnu's own, I sprinkle;' for they indeed belong to Vishnu.
5	4	19	What remains of the sprinkling-water he then pours out into the pits;--what moisture there is here in the vital airs , that he thereby puts into them: hence that moisture in the vital airs.
5	4	20	He pours it out with, 'You, the Rakshas-killers, the charm-killers, Vishnu's own, I pour out.' Thereupon he spreads barhis-grass, both such as is turned with its tops to the east and such as is turned to the north ; what hair there is here at (the openings of) the vital airs, that he thereby bestows: hence that hair at (the openings of) the vital airs.
5	4	21	He spreads it with, 'You, the Rakshas-killers, the charm-killers, Vishnu's own, I spread.' He, as it were, covers the bodies on the top, for that (grass) is indeed his (Vishnu's) hair .
5	4	22	Thereon he lays two pressing-boards  with, 'You, the Rakshas-killers, the charm-killers, Vishnu's own, I lay down;' they are indeed his (Vishnu's) jaws. He surrounds them (with earth) with, 'You, the Rakshas-killers, the charm-killers, Vishnu's own, I surround;' he thereby steadies them, makes them immovable.
5	4	23	Now the pressing-skin is cut straight all round and (dyed) red all over, for it is his (Vishnu's) tongue: the reason, then, why it is quite red, is because this tongue is, as it were, red. He lays it down with, 'Thou art Vishnu's own;' for it indeed belongs to Vishnu .
5	4	24	He then brings down the (five) press-stones. The press-stones, doubtless, are his (Vishnu's) teeth: hence, when they press (the Soma) with the stones it is as if he chewed with his teeth. He puts them down with, 'Ye are Vishnu's own;' for they indeed belong to Vishnu. Thus, then, the head of the sacrifice is complete.
6	1	1	The Sadas  is no other than his (Vishnu, the sacrifice's) belly; therefore they feed (drink) in the[paragraph continues] Sadas; for whatever food is eaten here on earth, all that settles down in the belly. And because all the gods sat (sad) in it, therefore it is called sadas: and so do these Brâhmans of every family now sit therein. By way of deity it belongs to Indra.
6	1	2	In the middle of it he puts up a (post) of udumbara wood (Ficus Glomerata); for the udumbara means strength and food; now the Sadas being his (Vishnu's belly), he thereby puts food therein; this is why he puts up an udumbara (post) in the middle of it.
6	1	3	From the peg  which stands in the middle on the hind-part of the altar, he strides six steps eastwards (along the 'spine'); the seventh he strides away from it to the right, for the sake of completeness, and there marks off a pit.
6	1	4	He takes the spade with , 'At the impulse of the divine Savitri, I take thee with the arms of the Asvins, with the hands of Pûshan: thou art a woman;' the significance of this formula is the same (as before). That spade, indeed, is a female (feminine): therefore. he says 'thou art a woman.'
6	1	5	He then marks off the pit with, 'Herewith[paragraph continues] I cut off the necks of the Rakshas!' for the spade is the thunderbolt: it is with the thunderbolt that he cuts off the necks of the evil spirits.
6	1	6	Thereupon he digs: eastwards he throws up the heap of earth. Having made the udumbara (post) of the same size as the sacrificer , he cuts it smooth all round, and lays it down, with the top to the east, in front (of the pit). Thereon he lays barhis-grass of the same length.
6	1	7	Now the sprinkling-water (used on this occasion) contains barley-corns. For the essence (sap) of plants is water; wherefore plants when eaten alone do not satiate; and the essence of water, on the other hand, are the plants; wherefore water when drunk alone does not satiate; but only when the two are united they satiate; for then they are sapful: 'with the sapful I will sprinkle,' so he thinks.
6	1	8	Now, the gods and the , both of them sprung from Pragâpati, were contending. Then all the plants went away from the gods, but the barley plants alone went not from them.
6	1	9	The gods then prevailed: by means of these (barley-grains) they attracted to themselves all the plants of their enemies; and because they attracted (yu) therewith, therefore they are called yava (barley).
6	1	10	They said, 'Come, let us put into the barley whatever sap there is of all plants!' And, accordingly, whatever sap there was of all plants, that they put into the barley: therefore the latter thrives lustily where other plants wither, for in such wisedid they put the sap into them. And in like manner does this one now by means of those (barley-grains) attract to himself all the plants of his enemies: this is why the sprinkling-water contains barley-corns.
6	1	11	He throws the barley-corns into it, with, 'Thou art barley (yava): keep thou (yavaya) from us the haters, keep from us the enemies!' In this there is nothing obscure. He then besprinkles (the post);--the significance of the sprinkling is one and the same: he thereby renders it sacrificially pure.
6	1	12	He sprinkles (the top, middle, and bottom parts), with, 'For the sky--thee! for the air--thee! for the earth--thee!' He thereby endows these worlds with strength and sap, bestows strength and sap on these worlds.
6	1	13	And the sprinkling-water which remains he pours into the hole, with, 'Be the worlds pure wherein the Fathers reside!' for a pit that is dug is sacred to the Fathers: this he thereby renders sacrificially pure.
6	1	14	He now strews barhis-grass therein, both eastward-pointed and northward-pointed with, 'Thou art the seat of the Fathers;' for that part of it (the post) which is dug into the ground is sacred to the Fathers; as though it were (naturally) established  among plants, and not dug in, so does it become established among those plants.
6	1	15	He raises it, with the text , 'Prop thou the sky! fill the air! stand firm on the earth!' Thereby he endows these worlds with strength and sap, bestows strength and sap on these worlds.
6	1	16	He then sinks it (in the hole, with), 'May Dyutâna, the son of the Maruts, plant thee!--' Dyutâna the son of the Maruts, doubtless, is he that blows yonder (the wind): by means of him he thus plants it;--'Mitra and Varuna with firm support!' Mitra and Varuna are the in-breathing and out-breathing: he thus plants it with the in-breathing and out-breathing.
6	1	17	He then heaps up (earth) round it, with, 'I enclose thee, winner of the priesthood, winner of the nobility, winner of growth of wealth!' Manifold, verily, is the prayer for blessing in the sacrificial texts: by this one he prays for the priesthood and nobility, those two vital forces . 'Winner of growth of wealth,'--growth of wealth means abundance: he thereby prays for abundance.
6	1	18	He then presses it firmly all round, with, 'Uphold thou the priesthood! uphold the nobility, uphold our life, uphold our progeny!' this is the blessing of this rite: that blessing he thereby invokes. He presses it so as to be level with the ground: with an (ordinary) hole (round trees for watering) it is higher than the ground, but in this way it is with the gods;--and thus it is not planted in an (ordinary) hole.
6	1	19	He then pours water thereon;--wherever, in digging, they wound or injure this (earth),--water being a means of soothing,--there he soothes it by that means of soothing, water, there he heals it by water: therefore he pours water thereon.
6	1	20	He then makes (the sacrificer) say, while touching it thus , 'Thou art firm: may this sacrificer be firm in this homestead through progeny'--or, 'through cattle!' thus whatever wish he entertains that wish is accomplished unto him.
6	1	21	Thereupon, having taken clarified butter with the dipping-spoon, he pours it upon the (forked) top , with 'O Heaven and Earth, be ye full of ghee!' whereby he endows the heaven and the earth with strength and sap, bestows strength and sap on them: upon them thus full of sap and affording subsistence, these creatures subsist.
6	1	22	He then lays on a mat , with, 'Thou art Indra's mat,'--for the Sadas belongs to Indra,--'a shelter to every one,' for Brâhmans of all families sit therein. He adds two mats, one on each side thereof, and three north of them and three further (to the north): these make nine. For the sacrificeis threefold and nine also is threefold: for this reason there are nine.
6	1	23	That Sadas has its tie-beams running (from south) to north, and the cart-shed (from west) to east. For this, the cart-shed, belongs exclusively to the gods: hence neither food nor drink is taken therein, because it belongs exclusively to the gods; and were any one either to eat or to drink therein, his head would verily burst asunder. But those two, the Âgnîdhra and the Sadas, are common (to the gods and men): hence food and drink is taken in these two, because they are common (to the gods and men). Now the north is the quarter of men: therefore the Sadas has its tie-beams running (from south) to north.
6	1	24	They enclose it , with the text , 'May these songs encompass thee on every side, O thou that delightest in songs! May these favours be favourably received by thee, invigorating the vigorous!' He that delights in songs, forsooth, is Indra, and songs mean the people: he thus surrounds the nobility with the people, and therefore the nobility is here surrounded on both sides by the people.
6	1	25	Thereupon he sews (the hurdles to the posts) with a needle and cord , with the text , 'Thou art Indra's sewer.' With, 'Thou art Indra's fixed (point),' he then makes a knot, 'lest it should fall asunder.' He undoes it again, when the work is completed; and thus disease befalls not either the Adhvaryu or the Sacrificer. When completed, hetouches it (the Sadas) with, 'Thou art Indra's own!' for the Sadas belongs to Indra.
6	1	26	In the north--with regard to the back part of the Soma-carts --he then raises the Âgnîdhra (shed). One half of it should be inside the altar, and one half outside; or more than one half may be inside the altar and less outside; or the whole of it may be inside the altar. When completed, he touches it with, 'Thou art the All-gods’ own!' To the All-gods it belongs, because on the day before (the Soma feast) the All-gods abide in it by the Vasatîvarî water.
6	1	27	Now, once on a time, the gods, while performing sacrifice, were afraid of an attack on the part of the Asura-Rakshas. The Asura-Rakshas attacked them from the south and forced them out of the Sadas, and overturned those hearths (dhishnya) of theirs which are within the Sadas.
6	1	28	For, indeed, all of those (hearths) at one time burnt as brightly as this Âhavanîya and the Gârhapatya and the Âgnîdhrîya; but ever since that time when they (the Asuras) overturned them they do not burn. They forced them (the gods) back to the Âgnîdhra (fire) and even won from them one half of the Âgnîdhra. From there the All-gods gained immortality ,--whence it (the Âgnîdhra fire) is sacred to the All-gods.
6	1	29	The gods kindled them again, as one would (light the fire where he is going to) stay. Therefore they are kindled at every Soma feast. Wherefore the duties of the Agnîdh should be discharged by one who is accomplished. Now he who is known and learned in sacred lore  is truly accomplished: hence they take to the Agnîdh his Dakshinâ first , since it is from thence (from the Agnîdh's fire) that the gods gained immortality. And if weakness were to come upon one of those that are consecrated, let (the Adhvaryu) say, 'Lead him to the Âgnîdhra!'--thinking 'that is unscathed, there he will not meet with affliction .' And because the All-gods gained immortality from there, therefore it is sacred to the All-gods.
6	2	1	The Dhishnya-hearths , forsooth, are no otherthan its (the sacrifice's) congeners . They have the same marks, and those which have the same marks are congeners; and these, then, are those (corresponding limbs) of its trunk.
6	2	2	Now Soma was in heaven, and the gods were here on earth. The gods desired, 'Would that Soma might come to us; we might sacrifice with him, when come.' They produced those two illusions, Suparnî and Kadrû ; Suparnî, forsooth, was Vâk (speech) , and Kadrû was this (earth). They caused discord between them.
6	2	3	They then disputed and said, 'Which of us shall spy furthest, shall win the other .'--'So be it!' Kadrû then said, 'Espy thou!'
6	2	4	Suparnî said, 'On yonder shore of this ocean there stands a white horse at a post, that I see; doest thou also see it?'--'I verily do!' Then said Kadrû 'Its tail was just now hanging down; there, now the wind tosses it, that I see.'
6	2	5	Now when Suparnî said, 'On yonder shore of this ocean,' the ocean, forsooth, is the altar, she thereby meant the altar; 'there stands a white horse at a post,' the white horse, forsooth, is Agni, and the post means the sacrificial stake. And when Kadrû said, 'Its tail was just now hanging down;there, now the wind tosses it, that I see;' this is nothing else than the rope.
6	2	6	Suparnî then said, 'Come, let us now fly thither to know which of us is the winner.' Kadrû said, 'Fly thou thither; thou wilt tell us, which of us is the winner.'
6	2	7	Suparnî then flew thither; and it was even as Kadrû had said. When she had returned, she (Kadrû) said to her, 'Hast thou won, or I?'--'Thou!' she replied. Such is the story called Suparnî-Kâdrava .'
6	2	8	Then said Kadrû, 'Verily I have won thine own self; yonder is Soma in the heaven: fetch him hither for the gods, and thereby redeem thyself from the gods !'--'So be it!' She brought forth the metres; and that Gâyatrî fetched Soma from heaven.
6	2	9	He was enclosed between two golden cups ; sharp-edged they closed together at every twinkling of the eye; and these two, forsooth, were Consecration and Penance. Those Gandharva Soma-wardens watched over him; they are these hearths, these fire-priests.
6	2	10	She tore off one of the two cups, and gave it to the gods,--this was Consecration: therewith the gods consecrated themselves,
6	2	11	She then tore off the second cup, and gave it to the gods,--this was Penance: therewith the gods underwent penance, to wit the Upasads, for the Upasads are penance.
6	2	12	She took possession (â-kakhâda)  of Soma by means of (a stick of) khadira wood (Acacia Catechu), whence (the name) Khadira; and because she thereby took possession of him, therefore the sacrificial stake and the wooden sword (sphya) are of khadira wood.She then carried him off while he was under the charge of the Akhâvâka, wherefore this Akhâvâka priest was excluded (from drinking Soma).
6	2	13	Indra and Agni preserved him for the production of creatures, whence the Akhâvâka priest belongs to Indra and Agni.
6	2	14	Therefore the consecrated keep charge of the king (Soma), 'lest (the Gandharvas) should carry him off.' Let him therefore guard him diligently, for verily in whosesoever charge they carry him off, he is excluded (from the Soma).
6	2	15	Wherefore the students guard their teacher, his house, and cattle, lest he should be taken from them. Let him therefore guard him (Soma) diligently in that place, for verily in whosesoever charge they carry him off, he is excluded therefrom. By means of him Suparnî redeemed herself from the gods; wherefore they say, 'He who has sacrificed shares in the world of bliss.'
6	2	16	Verily, even in being born, man, by his own self, is born as a debt (owing) to death. And in that he sacrifices, thereby he redeems himself from death, even as Suparnî then redeemed herself from the gods.
6	2	17	The gods worshipped with him. Those Gandharva Soma-wardens came after him; and having come up they said, 'Do ye let us share in the sacrifice, exclude us not from the sacrifice; let there be for us also a share in the sacrifice!'
6	2	18	They said, 'What will there be for us, then?'--'Even as in yonder world we have been his keepers, so also will we be his keepers here on earth!'
6	2	19	The gods spake, 'So be it!' By saying, '(Here are) your Soma-wages . . .' he assigns to them the price of the Soma . They then said unto them, 'At the third pressing an offering of ghee shall fall to your share, but not one of Soma, for the Soma-draught has been taken from you, wherefore ye are not worthy of a Soma-offering!' And accordingly, when he pours ghee on the hearths by means of fagots , at the evening libation, that same offering of ghee falls to their share, but not one of Soma.
6	2	20	'And what they will offer in the fire that will satiate you;' hence that which they offer in the fire satiates them. 'And when they will move about, holding the Soma over each , that will satiate you;' hence when they move about, holding the Soma over each (hearth), that satiates them.[paragraph continues] Wherefore let not the Adhvaryu pass between  the hearths, for the Adhvaryu carries the Soma, and they sit waiting for him (Soma) with open mouths, and he would enter into their open mouths; and either Agni would burn him, or else that god who rules over beasts (Rudra) would seek after him; hence whenever the Adhvaryu should have business in the hall, let him pass north of the Âgnîdhra shed.
6	2	21	Now it is for the protection of Soma that those (hearths) are thrown up, to wit the Âhavanîya in front (on the high altar), the Mârgâlîya in the south, and the Âgnîdhrîya in the north; and those that are in the Sadas (protect him) from behind.
6	2	22	They are in part raised , in part they are assigned . And, in truth, they themselves insisted thereon, saying, 'They shall in part raise us, and in part they shall assign us; thus we shall know again that heavenly world from which we have come, thus we shall not go astray.'
6	2	23	And whichever of them are raised they arethereby visibly in this world; but whichever of them are assigned they are thereby visibly in yonder world.
6	2	24	They have two names; for, in truth, they themselves insisted thereon, saying, 'We have not prospered with these names, since Soma has been taken away from us; well, then, let us take each a second name!' They took each a second name, and therewith prospered, inasmuch as they from whom the Soma-draught had been taken had a share in the sacrifice assigned to them; hence they have two names. Wherefore let a Brahman, if he prosper not, take a second name, for verily he prospers, whosoever, knowing this, takes a second name.
6	2	25	Now what he offers in the fire, that he offers unto the gods, thereby the gods exist; and what (Soma) is consumed in the Sadas, that he offers unto men, thereby men exist; and in that the Nârâsamsa  cups of Soma) stand with the Soma-carts, thereby he offers unto the Fathers, thereby the Fathers exist.
6	2	26	But those creatures which are not admitted to the sacrifice are forlorn; wherefore he now admits to the sacrifice those creatures here on earth that are not forlorn; behind  the men are the beasts; and behind the gods are the birds, the plants, andthe trees; and thus whatsoever exists here on earth all that is admitted to the sacrifice. And verily both the gods and men, and the Fathers drink together , and this is their symposium; of old they drank together visibly, but now they do so unseen.
6	3	1	Verily he who consecrates himself, consecrates himself for the sake of this All; for he consecrates himself for the sacrifice, and this All indeed results from  the sacrifice; having prepared the sacrifice for which he consecrates himself, he now sets free (or produces) this All.
6	3	2	The reason why he performs the Vaisargina offerings is this. They are called Vaisargina, because he sets free (vi-sarg) this All; wherefore let him who takes part in the rite  touch (the sacrificer) from behind; but if he have to go elsewhere (on business) he need not heed this. When he sacrifices, he sets free this All.
6	3	3	And again why he performs the Vaisargina offerings. Vishnu, forsooth, is the sacrifice; by his strides he obtained (vi-kram) for the gods that all-pervading power (vikrânti) which now belongs to them; by his first step he gained this same (earth); by the second, the region of air; and by the last,the heaven. And that same pervading power Vishnu, the sacrifice, obtains by his strides for this (sacrificer) when he sacrifices: this is why he performs the Vaisargina offerings.
6	3	4	In the afternoon, having covered the altar (with sacrificial grass), and handed (to the sacrificer and his wife) one half of the fast-milk, they enter (the hall), put fire-wood on , and prepare the under-layer (of gravel). He (the Adhvaryu) puts the butter on (the old Gârhapatya), and cleans the spoons. The sacrificer takes the king (Soma) on his lap. He (the Adhvaryu) scatters about the (dust of the) foot-print of the Soma-cow behind the (new) Gârhapatya for the sake of a firm standing, for it is with the foot that one stands firmly.
6	3	5	Now some divide it (the dust) into four parts : one fourth part (they put) into the under-layer whereon they take up the Âhavanîya (for transferring it to the high altar); with one fourth part they anoint the axle; one fourth part (they put) into this underlayer (for taking out the Âgnîdhrîya fire); and one fourth part he scatters about behind the Gârhapatya.
6	3	6	But let him not do this; let him rather scatter it about entirely behind the Gârhapatya. Having then purified the ghee, he takes thereof four ladlings (with the sruva), both in the guhû and in the upabhrit; and clotted ghee  in five ladlings, with ,[paragraph continues] 'Thou art a light endowed with all forms, the flame of the All-gods;' for the clotted ghee belongs to the All-gods. When the wood is well kindled, they hold the spoons for him.
6	3	7	He then offers , with, 'Thou, O Soma, wilt widely withhold thy protection from the life-injuring  hatreds put forth by others, Hail!' Thereby he takes a firm stand on this resting-place, the earth, and gains this world.
6	3	8	He then offers the second oblation to (Soma) the Nimble, with, 'May the Nimble graciously accept the butter, Hail!' For he (Soma) spake upon that time, 'Verily I am afraid of the Rakshas: do ye make me to be too small for their deadly shaft, so that the evil spirits (the Rakshas) shall not injure me on the way; and take me across in the form of a drop, for the drop is nimble.' And accordingly, having made him too small for the deadly shaft, they lead him safely across in the form of a drop, from fear of the Rakshas, for the drop is nimble: this is why he offers the second oblation to (Soma) the Nimble.
6	3	9	They lift the (burning) fire-wood, and place it on the support. He then says (to the Hotri), 'Recite for Agni, taken forward!' or (say some), '--for Soma, led forward.' But let him say, 'Recite for Agni, taken forward !'
6	3	10	They take the pressing-stones, the Soma-trough (drona-kalasa); Vâyu's cups , the (twenty pieces of) fire-wood, the enclosing-sticks of kârshmarya wood (Gmelina Arborea), one prastara of asvavâla grass , and the two Vidhritis of sugarcane; that barhis (which was used before ) is tied up therewith. Further, the two spits for (roasting) the omenta , the two ropes (for binding the stake and victims), the two churning-sticks (for producing fire), the adhimanthana chip, and the two vrishana ,--having taken up all these they go forward (to the Âgnîdhra): thus the sacrifice goes upwards .
6	3	11	While they proceed thither, he makes (the sacrificer) say the text , 'O Agni, lead us on a good path unto wealth, thou, O God, that knowest all works! keep thou from us the sin that leadeth astray, and we will offer unto thee most ample adoration!' He thereby places Agni in front, and Agni marches in front repelling the evil spirits; and they take him thither on a (way) free from danger andinjury. They proceed, and reach the Âgnîdhra; and he (the Adhvaryu) puts (the fire) down on the Âgnîdhra hearth.
6	3	12	Thereon, when laid down, he offers with the text , 'May this Agni make wide room for us; may he march in front smiting the haters! May he gain riches in the winning of riches: may he, fiercely rushing, conquer the enemies, Hail!' By means of him (Agni) he thus takes a firm stand in that resting-place, the aerial region, and gains that world.
6	3	13	In the same place they deposit the pressing-stones, the Soma-trough, and Vâyu's cups . Having then taken up the other (objects), they proceed and deposit them north of the Âhavanîya.
6	3	14	The Adhvaryu takes the sprinkling-water, and sprinkles first the fire-wood, and then the altar. They then hand to him the altar-grass. He puts it down with the knot towards the east, and sprinkles it. Having poured (the remaining sprinkling-water) upon (the root ends of the altar-grass), and untied the knot,--the Prastara-hunch of asvavâla grass is tied together (with the altar-grass),--he takes that; and having taken the Prastara, he spreads the altar-grass in a single layer. Having spread the altar-grass, he lays the enclosing-sticks of kârshmarya-wood round (the fire). Having laid the enclosing-sticks around, he puts two kindling-sticks (on the fire); and having put on the two kindling-sticks,
6	3	15	He offers with the text , 'Stride thou widely, O Vishnu, make wide room for our abode! drink the ghee, thou born of ghee,and speed the lord of the sacrifice ever onwards, Hail!' Thereby he takes a firm stand in that resting-place, the sky: he thus gains that world by offering with that (verse).
6	3	16	And as to his offering with a verse addressed to Vishnu, it was thus that they made him (Soma) to be too small for the deadly shaft and led him safely across in the form of a drop, for the drop is nimble. And having attained to safety, he now makes him the one he really is, namely, the sacrifice, for Vishnu is the sacrifice: therefore he offers with a verse addressed to Vishnu.
6	3	17	After depositing the spoons  and touching water, he makes the king (Soma) enter (the Havirdhâna shed). The reason why he makes the king enter, after depositing the spoons and touching water, is this. The ghee is the thunderbolt, and Soma is seed: hence it is after depositing the spoons and touching water that he makes the king enter, lest he should injure the seed Soma with the thunderbolt, the ghee.
6	3	18	He spreads the black deer-skin on the enclosed part of the southern Soma-cart, and sets him down thereon with , 'O divine Savitri, this is thy Soma: shield him; may they not injure thee!' whereby he makes him over to the God Savitri for protection.
6	3	19	Having quitted his hold of him, he (the sacrificer) renders homage to him with, 'Now, O divine Soma, hast thou, a god, joined the gods, andhere I the men with increase of wealth.' Now Agni and Soma have seized him who consecrates himself between their jaws , for that consecration-offering belongs to Agni and Vishnu, and Vishnu forsooth is no other than Soma; and he himself that consecrates himself is the food of the gods: thus they have seized him between their jaws, and he now expressly redeems himself from Soma, when he says, 'Now, O divine Soma, hast thou, a god, joined the gods, and here (have I joined) the men with increase of wealth;'--increase of wealth means abundance: 'with abundance' he thereby means to say.
6	3	20	He then walks out (of the cart-shed), with, 'Hail! I am freed from Varuna's noose!' For he, truly, is in Varuna's noose who is in another's mouth: he now frees himself from Varuna's noose, when he says, 'Hail! I am freed from Varuna's noose.'
6	3	21	He then puts a kindling-stick on the Âhavanîya in this way , 'O Agni, protector of vows, on thee, O protector of vows--' for Agni is lord of vows to the gods, wherefore he says, 'O Agni, protector of vows, on thee, O protector of vows'--'what bodily form of thine hath been on me, (may) that (be) on thee; what bodily form of mine has been on thee, (may) that (be) here on me! Our vows, O lord of vows, (have been performed) rightly: the lord of consecration hathapproved my consecration; the lord of penance hath approved my penance.' Thereby he frees himself visibly from Agni, and sacrifices with a self (body) now his own: hence they now partake of his food, for he is a man (again); hence they now use his (real) name, for he is a man. And as to their not eating (of his food) heretofore, it is as one would not eat of sacrificial food, before offering has been made thereof: therefore let no one partake of the food of one consecrated. He now loosens his fingers.
6	4	1	Being about to cut the sacrificial stake, he offers  with a verse addressed to Vishnu. For the stake belongs to Vishnu; therefore he offers with a verse addressed to Vishnu.
6	4	2	And again, why he offers with a verse addressed to Vishnu--Vishnu being the sacrifice, he thus approaches the stake by means of the sacrifice: therefore he offers with a verse addressed to Vishnu.
6	4	3	If he offers with the offering-spoon, he offers after taking ghee by four ladlings; and if he offers with the dipping-spoon, he offers after 'cutting out' (some ghee from the pot) with the dipping-spoon,--with the text , 'Stride thou widely,[paragraph continues] O Vishnu, make wide room for our abode! drink the ghee, thou born of ghee, and speed the lord of the sacrifice ever onwards! Hail!'
6	4	4	He takes the ghee which is left (in the melting-pot). Whatever chopping-knife the carpenter uses, that the carpenter now takes. They then proceed (to the wood). Whatever (tree) they select for the stake,
6	4	5	That he touches while muttering ,--or he salutes it while standing behind it with his face towards the east,--'I have passed over the others, I have not gone nigh the others--' he does indeed pass over others and does not go near to others: wherefore he says, 'I have passed over the others, I have not gone nigh the others.'
6	4	6	'Thee have I found on the nearer side of the farther, and on the farther side of the nearer;' he does indeed fell it on the nearer side of the farther, of those that are farther away from it; and 'on the farther side of the nearer,' he says, because he does fell it on the farther side of the nearer, of those that are on this side of it. This is why he says, 'Thee have I found on the nearer side of the farther, and on the farther side of the nearer.'
6	4	7	'Thee do we favour, O divine lord of the forest , for the worship of the gods.' As for the good work, he would favour (select) one from amidst many (men) and he (the chosen) would be well-disposed to that work, even so does he now, for the good work, favour that (tree) from amidst many, and it becomes well-disposed to the felling.
6	4	8	'Thee may the gods favour for the worship of the gods!' for that is truly successful which the gods favour for the good work: therefore he says, 'Thee may the gods favour for the worship of the gods!'
6	4	9	He then touches it with the dipping-spoon, with, 'For Vishnu, thee!' for the stake belongs to Vishnu, since Vishnu is the sacrifice, and he fells this (tree) for the sacrifice: therefore he says, 'For Vishnu, thee!'
6	4	10	He then places a blade of darbha-grass between , with, 'O plant, shield it!' for the axe is a thunderbolt; but thus that thunderbolt, the axe, does not hurt it (the tree). He then strikes with the axe, with, 'O axe, hurt it not!' for the axe is a thunderbolt, but thus that thunderbolt, the axe, does not hurt it.
6	4	11	The first chip  which he cuts off, he takes (and lays aside). Let him cut (the tree) so as to cause no obstruction to the axle . For, indeed, it is on a cart that they convey it, and in this way he does not obstruct the cart.
6	4	12	Let him cut it so as to fall towards the east, for the east is the quarter of the gods; or towards the north, for the north is the quarter of men; or towards the west. But let him take care to keep it from (falling towards) the southern quarter, for that is the quarter of the Fathers: therefore he must take care to keep it from the southern quarter.
6	4	13	The falling (tree) he addresses with the text , 'Graze not the sky! hurt not the air! unite with the earth!' for verily that (tree) which they cut for the stake is a thunderbolt, and these worlds tremble for fear of that falling thunderbolt; but he thereby propitiates it for these worlds, and thus propitiated it injures not these worlds.
6	4	14	Now when he says, 'Graze not the sky,' he means to say, 'Injure not the sky!' In the words 'hurt not the air' there is nothing obscure. By 'Unite with the earth,' he means to say, 'Be thou in harmony with the earth!' 'For this sharp-edged axe hath led thee forward unto great bliss,' for this sharp axe indeed leads it forward.
6	4	15	Upon the stump he then offers ghee, 'lest the evil spirits should rise therefrom after (the tree):' ghee being a thunderbolt, he thus repels the evil spirits by means of the thunderbolt, and thus the evil spirits do not rise therefrom after it. And ghee being seed, he thus endows the trees with that seed; and from that seed (in) the stump trees are afterwards produced .
6	4	16	He sacrifices with, 'Grow thou out of this, O lord of the forest, with a hundred shoots![paragraph continues] May we grow out with a thousand shoots!' There is nothing obscure in this.
6	4	17	Thereupon he cuts it (the stake of the proper length): of whatever length he cuts it the first time, so long let it remain.
6	4	18	He may cut it five cubits long; for fivefold is the sacrifice and fivefold is the animal (victim), and five seasons there are in the year: therefore he may cut it five cubits long.
6	4	19	He may cut it six cubits long; for six seasons there are in the year; and the year is a thunderbolt, as the sacrificial stake is a thunderbolt: therefore he may cut it six cubits long.
6	4	20	He may cut it eight cubits long,  eight-cornered, for eight syllables has the Gâyatrî, and the Gâyatrî is the fore-part of the sacrifice, as this (stake) is the forepart of the sacrifice: therefore it is eight-cornered.
7	1	1	He takes the spade, with , 'I take thee, at the impulse of the divine Savitri, with the arms of the Asvins, with the hands of Pûshan: thou art a woman.' The significance of that formula is the same (as before); and that spade (abhri, fem.) is indeed female: therefore he says 'thou art a woman.'
7	1	2	He thus draws the outline of the hole (for the stake ), with, 'Herewith I cut off the necks ofthe Rakshas!' The spade is the thunderbolt: with the thunderbolt he thus cuts off the necks of the Rakshas.
7	1	3	He then digs, and throws up a heap of earth towards the east. He digs the hole, making it equal (in depth) with the (unhewn) bottom part (of the stake). In front of it he lays down the stake with the top towards the east. Thereon he puts sacrificial grass of the same size, and thereupon he puts the chip of the stake. In front on the (north) side (of the stake) he puts down the head-piece . The sprinkling-water has barley-corns mixed with it: the significance of this is the same (as before ).
7	1	4	He throws the barley-corns in with, 'Thou art barley (yava), keep thou (yavaya) from us the haters, keep from us the enemies!' There is nothing obscure in this. He then sprinkles: the significance of the sprinkling is one and the same: he thereby renders it sacrificially pure.
7	1	5	He sprinkles (the top, middle, and bottom parts) with, 'For the sky--thee! for the air--thee! for the earth--thee!' the stake being a thunderbolt (he does so) for the protection of these worlds : 'I sprinkle thee for the protection of these worlds,' is what he thereby means to say.
7	1	6	The sprinkling-water that remains he then pours into the hole with, 'Be the worlds purewherein the Fathers reside!' for a pit that is dug is sacred to the Fathers: this he thereby renders sacrificially pure.
7	1	7	Thereupon he strews barhis-grass therein, both eastward-pointed and northward-pointed, with, 'Thou art the seat of the Fathers!' for that part of it (the stake) which is dug into the ground is sacred to the Fathers: as though it were (naturally) established among plants, and not dug in, so does it become established among those plants.
7	1	8	He then throws in the (first) chip  of the stake. Now that chip of the outer (bark) doubtless is the vigour of trees; hence, when a chip of their outer (bark) is cut off they dry up, for it is their vigour. Hence, when he throws in the chip of the stake, he does so thinking, 'I will plant it (the stake) full of vigour.' The reason why it is this (chip) and no other, is that this one has been produced with a formula, is sacrificially pure: therefore he throws in the chip of the stake.
7	1	9	He throws it in with , 'Thou art a leader, easy of access to the Unnetris ;' for that (chip) is cut from it in front, wherefore he says, 'Thou art a leader, easy of access to the Unnetris.' 'Be thou mindful of this: it will stand upon thee!' for it (the stake) will indeed stand on it, wherefore he says, 'Be thou mindful of this: it will stand upon thee.'
7	1	10	Having then taken out ghee with the dipping-spoon, he offers it into the hole, 'lest the evil spirits should rise from below:' ghee is a thunderbolt, hethus repels the evil spirits by means of the thunderbolt, and thus the evil spirits do not rise from below. Having then gone round to the front, he sits down facing the north and anoints the stake. He says (to the Hotri), 'Recite to the stake as it is anointed !'
7	1	11	He anoints it with, 'The divine Savitri anoint thee with sweet drink (milk)!' for Savitri is the impeller (prasavitri) of the gods, and that stake is in reality the sacrificer himself; and sweet drink is everything here; he thus puts it in connection with all that, and Savitri, the impeller, impels it for him: therefore he says, 'The divine Savitri anoint thee with sweet drink!'
7	1	12	Having then anointed the top-ring on both sides, he puts it on (the stake) with, 'To the full-berried plants--thee!' for that (top-ring) is as its berry. And as to its being, as it were, contracted in the middle, the berry  here on trees is fastened (to the stalk) sideways; what connecting part there is between (the fruit and stalk) pressed in, as it were, that he thereby makes it. This is why it is, as it were, contracted in the middle.
7	1	13	He anoints from top to bottom the (corner) facing the fire; for the (corner) facing the fire is the sacrificer, and the ghee is sap: with sap he thus anoints the sacrificer; therefore he anoints from top to bottom the (corner) facing the fire. He thengrasps the girding-part all round, and says (to the Hotri), 'Recite to the (stake) being set up!'
7	1	14	He raises it with, 'With thy crest thou hast touched the sky; with thy middle thou hast filled the air; with thy foot thou hast steadied the earth;'--the sacrificial stake being a thunderbolt, (he raises it) for the conquering of these worlds; with that thunderbolt he gains these worlds, and deprives his enemies of their share in these worlds.
7	1	15	He then plants it (in the hole) with , 'To what resorts of thine we long to go where are the swift-footed, many-horned kine; there, forsooth, was imprinted wide-striding Vishnu's highest mighty foot-step.' With this trishtubh verse he plants it; the trishtubh is a thunderbolt, as the sacrificial stake is a thunderbolt; therefore he plants it with a trishtubh verse.
7	1	16	That (corner which was) facing the fire he places opposite the fire; for the (corner) facing the fire is the sacrificer, and the sacrifice is fire. Hence were he to turn the fire-corner aside from the fire, the sacrificer would assuredly turn aside from the sacrifice; therefore he places the (corner which was) facing the fire opposite the fire. He then heaps up (earth) round it and presses it firmly all round, and pours water thereon .
7	1	17	Thereupon he makes (the sacrificer) say while touching it , 'See ye the deeds of Vishnu, whereby he beheld the sacred ordinances, Indra's alliedfriend!' For he who has set up the sacrificial stake has hurled the thunderbolt: 'See ye Vishnu's conquest!' he means to say when he says, 'See ye the deeds of Vishnu, whereby he beheld the sacred ordinances, Indra's allied friend.' Indra, forsooth, is the deity of the sacrifice, and the sacrificial stake belongs to Vishnu; he thereby connects it with Indra; therefore he says, 'Indra's allied friend.'
7	1	18	He then looks up at the top-ring with , 'The wise ever behold that highest step of Vishnu, fixed like an eye in the heaven.' For he who has set up the sacrificial stake has hurled the thunderbolt: 'See ye that conquest of Vishnu!' he means to say when he says, 'The wise ever behold that highest step of Vishnu, fixed like an eye in the heaven.'
7	1	19	He then girds (the stake with a rope of kusa-grass). Now it is to cover its nakedness that he girds it; wherefore he girds it in this place (viz. on a level with the sacrificer's navel), for it is thus that this (nether) garment is (slung round) . He thereby puts food into him, for it is there that the food settles; therefore he girds it at that place.
7	1	20	He girds it with a triple (rope), for threefold is food, and food means cattle; and (there is) the father and the mother, and what is born is the third; therefore he girds it with a triple (rope).
7	1	21	He girds it with , 'Thou art enfolded; may the heavenly hosts enfoldthee! may riches enfold this sacrificer among men!' He invokes a blessing on the sacrificer, when he says, 'May riches enfold this sacrificer among men.'
7	1	22	Thereupon he inserts a chip of the stake (under the rope) with, 'Thou art the son of the sky.' For it is doubtless the offspring of that (sacrificial stake); hence if there be the full number of eleven stakes , let him insert in each its own (chip) without confounding them; and his offspring is born orderly and not foolish. But whosoever inserts them in confusion, not its own in each, verily his offspring is born disorderly and foolish; therefore let him insert its own in each without confounding them.
7	1	23	Moreover, that chip of the stake is made an ascent to the heavenly world; there is this girdle-rope; after the rope the chip of the stake; after the chip of the stake the top-ring; and from the top-ring one reaches the heavenly world.
7	1	24	And as to why it is called svaru ('very sore'),--that (chip) is cut off from that (stake), and thus is its own (sva) sore (arus); therefore it is called 'svaru.'
7	1	25	With that part of it which is dug in, he gains the world of the Fathers; and with what is above the dug-in part, up to the girdle-rope, he gains the world of men; and with what is above the rope, up to the top-ring, he gains the world of the gods; and what (space of) two or three fingers’ breadthsthere is above the top-ring,--the gods called the 'Blessed ,'--their world he therewith gains; verily, whosoever thus knows this, he becomes one of the same world with the blessed gods.
7	1	26	That (sacrificial stake) he sets up on the fore-part (of the altar); for the stake is a thunderbolt, as the club is a thunderbolt. But in hurling the club one takes hold of its fore-part; and that (stake) is the fore-part of the sacrifice; therefore he sets it up on the fore-part (of the altar).
7	1	27	Verily, by means of the sacrifice the gods gained that supreme authority which they now wield. They spake, 'How may this (world) of ours be made unattainable to men?' They sipped the sap of the sacrifice, as bees would suck out honey, and having drained the sacrifice and scattered it by means of the sacrificial stake, they disappeared. And because they scattered (yopaya) therewith, therefore it is called yûpa (sacrificial stake). At the head stands intelligence, at the head swiftness of thought; therefore he sets it up on the fore-part (of the altar).
7	1	28	It is eight-cornered; for the gâyatrî  metre consists of eight syllables, and the gâyatrî is the fore-part of the sacrifice, as this (stake) is the forepart of the sacrifice; therefore it is eight-cornered.
7	1	29	Now the gods once threw it after (the prastara into the fire) even as now some throw it after, thinking, 'So the gods did it.' Thereupon the Rakshas sipped the sacrifice (Soma) after (the gods).
7	1	30	The gods said unto the Adhvaryu, 'Offer thou only a chip of the stake; thereby this (sacrificer)will be bid good-speed ; and thus the Rakshas will not hereafter sip the sacrifice, thinking, "that (stake) surely is a raised thunderbolt."'
7	1	31	The Adhvaryu, then, offered up only a chip of the stake, and thereby that (sacrificer) was bid good-speed; and thus the Rakshas did not thereafter sip the sacrifice, thinking, 'that surely is a raised thunderbolt.'
7	1	32	And in like manner does he now only offer up that chip of the sacrificial stake ; thereby this (sacrificer) is bid good-speed; and thus the Rakshas do not thereafter sip the sacrifice, thinking, 'that surely is a raised thunderbolt!' He offers it  with the text , 'May thy smoke rise up to the sky, thy light to the heavens! fill the earth with ashes, Hail!'
7	2	1	Verily, as large as the altar is, so large is the earth. The sacrificial stakes are thunderbolts; and by means of these thunderbolts he obtains possession of this earth, and excludes his enemies from sharing therein. Hence there are eleven stakes, and the twelfth lies aside rough-hewn; he puts it down south (of the altar). The reason why the twelfth lies aside is this.
7	2	2	Now the gods, while performing this sacrifice,were afraid of an attack from the Asura-Rakshas. Those raised (sacrificial stakes), then, were as a discharged arrow,--therewith one either smites or smites not; as a hurled club,--therewith one either smites or smites not. But that twelfth (stake) lying aside,--even as an arrow drawn but not discharged, as (a weapon) raised but not hurled, so was that a thunderbolt raised for repelling the evil spirits on the south; therefore the twelfth (stake) lies aside.
7	2	3	He lays it down with , 'This is thy place on earth; thine is the beast of the forest.' There are the animal (victim) and the sacrificial stake; to this one he thereby assigns of animals that of the forest, and thus it, too, is possessed of an animal (victim). That setting up of the eleven sacrificial stakes is said to be of two kinds,--some, namely, set (them all) up (on the previous day) for the morrow's Soma feast, and others set up (one) stake for the preparation  of the morrow's Soma feast.
7	2	4	Let him, however, not do this; but let him only set up the one opposite the fire. For after setting it up the Adhvaryu does not quit his hold of it till the girding; but those (others) remainungirt during that night. Thus there would be an offence, since it is for the victim that the stake is set up, and the victim is (only) slaughtered on the next morning: let him therefore set up (the others) on the next morning.
7	2	5	Let him first set up that (stake) which stands (immediately) north of the one opposite the fire, then the one on the south, then a northern one,--last of all the one on the southern flank: thus it (the row of stakes) inclines to the north.
7	2	6	But they also say conversely , 'Let him first set up that which is south of the one opposite the fire, then the northern one, then a southern one,--last of all the one on the northern flank: and thus indeed his work attains completion towards the north.'
7	2	7	Let the largest be the one forming the southern flank; then shorter and shorter; and the one forming the northern flank the shortest: thus (the row of stakes) inclines to the north.
7	2	8	Thereupon they set up the wife-stake for the wives. It is for the sake of completeness, forsooth, that the wife-stake is set up: there they seize (and bind) the victim for Tvashtri, for Tvashtri fashions the cast seed, and hence he fashions the seed now cast. It (the victim to Tvashtri) is an animal with testicles, for such a one is a begetter. Let him not slay that one, but let him set it free after fire has been carried round it. Were he to slay it, there would assuredly be an end to offspring, but in this way he sets free the offspring. Therefore let him notslay it, but let him set it free after fire has been carried round it.
7	3	1	There are both an animal and a sacrificial stake, for never do they immolate an animal without a stake. And as to why this is so:--well, animals did not at first submit thereto that they should become food, as they are now become food; for just as man here walks two-footed and erect, so did they walk two-footed and erect.
7	3	2	Then the gods perceived that thunderbolt, to wit, the sacrificial stake; they raised it, and from fear thereof they (the animals) shrunk together and thus became four-footed, and thus became food, as they are now become food, for they submitted thereto: wherefore they immolate the animal only at a stake and never without a stake.
7	3	3	Having driven up the victim, and churned the fire, he binds it (to the stake). And as to why this is so:--well, animals did not at first submit thereto that they should become sacrificial food, as they are now become sacrificial food and are offered up in the fire. The gods secured them: even thus secured they did not resign themselves.
7	3	4	They spake, 'Verily, these (animals) know not the manner of this, that it is in fire that sacrificial food is offered, nor (do they know) that secure resort (the fire): let us offer fire into the fire after securing the animals and churning the fire, and they will know that this truly is the manner of sacrificial food,this its resort; that it is truly in fire that sacrificial food is offered: and accordingly they will resign themselves, and will be favourably disposed to the slaughtering.'
7	3	5	Having, then, first secured the animals, and churned the fire, they offered fire into the fire; and then they (the animals) knew that this truly is the manner of sacrificial food, this its resort; that it is truly in fire that sacrificial food is offered. And accordingly they resigned themselves, and became favourably disposed to the slaughtering.
7	3	6	And in like manner does he now offer fire into the fire, after securing the animal and churning the fire. It (the animal) knows that this truly is the manner of sacrificial food, this its resort; that it is truly in fire that sacrificial food is offered; and accordingly it resigns itself and becomes favourably disposed to the slaughtering. Therefore having driven up the victim and churned the fire, he binds it (to the stake).
7	3	7	As to this they say, 'Let him not drive up (the victim), nor churn the fire; but having taken the rope and straightway gone thither and put (the rope) round it, let him bind it.' Let him, however, not do this; for it would be as if he intended to commit secretly some lawless action. Let him therefore go round there.
7	3	8	Then, taking a straw, he drives it up, thinking, 'having a companion, I will secure it;' for he who has a companion is strong.
7	3	9	He takes the straw with , 'Thou art a cheerer!' for a companion does cheer one: therefore he says, 'Thou art a cheerer.' 'The celestial hosts have approached the gods;'the celestial hosts, forsooth, are those beasts: 'they have submitted to the gods' he means to say, when he says, 'The celestial hosts have approached the gods.'
7	3	10	'The considerate , best of leaders;' for the gods are wise: therefore he says, 'The considerate, best of leaders.'
7	3	11	'O divine Tvashtri, settle the wealth!' for Tvashtri is lord of beasts (cattle), and wealth means cattle, it is with regard to those which did not submit that the gods then said to Tvashtri, 'Quiet them,' when he says, 'O divine Tvashtri, settle the wealth!'
7	3	12	'May the offerings be relished by thee!' Since they themselves submitted thereto that they should become sacrificial food, therefore he says, 'May the offerings be relished by thee!'
7	3	13	'Rejoice, ye prosperous!' for cattle are prosperous: therefore he says, 'Rejoice ye prosperous.' 'O Lord of prayer, preserve our goods!' The Lord of prayer, forsooth, is the Brahman; and goods mean cattle: those, which did not submit, the gods on that occasion enclosed with the Brahman on the farther side, and they did not pass over it. And in like manner does he now enclose them with the Brahman on the farther side, and they do not pass over it: therefore he says, 'O Lord of prayer, preserve our goods!' Having made a noose he throws it over (the victim) . Now then as to the binding itself.
7	4	1	Having made a noose, he throws it over (the victim) with , 'With the noose of sacred order I bind thee, O oblation to the gods!' for that rope, forsooth, is Varuna's: therefore he thus binds it with the noose of sacred order, and thus that rope of Varuna does not injure it.
7	4	2	'Be bold, O man !' for at first man dared not  to approach it (the victim); but now that he thus binds it with the noose of sacred order, as an oblation to the gods, man dares to approach it: therefore he says, 'Be bold, O man!'
7	4	3	He then binds it (to the stake) with , 'At the impulse of the divine Savitri, I bind thee with the arms of the Asvins, with the hands of Pûshan, thee agreeable to Agni and Soma!' Even as on that occasion , when taking out an oblation for a deity, he assigns it, so does he now assign it to the two deities. He then sprinkles it,--one and the same, forsooth, is thesignificance of sprinkling: he thereby makes it sacrificially pure.
7	4	4	He sprinkles with, 'For the waters--thee, for the plants!' whereby it (the victim) exists, thereby he thus makes it sacrificially pure. For when it rains, then plants are produced here on earth; and by eating plants and drinking water that sap originates, and from sap seed, and from seed beasts: hence whereby it exists, wherefrom it springs, thereby he thus makes it sacrificially pure.
7	4	5	'May thy mother grant thee permission, and thy father--;' for it is from its mother and father that it is born: hence wherefrom it is born, thereby he thus makes it sacrificially pure; '--thine own brother, thy fellow in the herd;' whereby he means to say, 'whatever kin there is of thine, with their approval I slay thee.' 'I sprinkle thee, agreeable to Agni and Soma;' he thus makes it pure for those two deities for whom he slays it.
7	4	6	With , 'Thou art a drinker of water,' he then holds (the lustral water) under (its mouth), whereby he renders it internally pure. He then sprinkles it underneath (the body), with, 'May the divine waters make it palatable, a true palatable offering to the gods!' he thus makes it sacrificially pure all over.
7	4	7	Thereupon he says (to the Hotri), 'Recite to the fire being kindled!' when he has made the second libation of ghee , and returned (to his former place) without letting the two spoons touch one another , he anoints the victim with the (ghee in the)guhû, For the second libation is the head of the sacrifice, and the sacrifice here indeed is that victim: hence he thereby puts the head on the sacrifice and therefore anoints the victim with the guhû.
7	4	8	With 'May thy breath unite with the wind!' he anoints it on the forehead; with 'Thy limbs with those worthy of sacrifice' on the shoulders; with 'The lord of sacrifice with (the object of) his prayer!' the loins; whereby he means to say, 'For whatsoever object the animal is slain, do thou obtain that!'
7	4	9	For, indeed, the breath of the victim when slain here passes into the wind: 'Obtain thou that thy breath may pass into the wind!' is what he thereby means to say. 'Thy limbs with those worthy of offering' he says, because it is with its limbs that they sacrifice: 'Obtain thou that they may sacrifice with thy limbs' is what he thereby means to say. 'The lord of sacrifice with his prayer,' hereby they invoke a blessing on the sacrificer: 'Obtain thou that through thee they may invoke a blessing on the sacrificer' is what he thereby means to say. He then deposits the two spoons and calls for the Sraushat with a view to the Pravara (election of the Hotri) . The significance of this is the same (as before).
7	4	10	Thereupon he calls a second time for the Sraushat, for on this occasion there are two Hotris it is with regard to the Maitrâvaruna  that he now calls for the Sraushat. But it is the sacrificer whomhe chooses, saying, 'Verily, Agni is the leader of the divine hosts,' for Agni is the head of the deities; wherefore he says, 'Verily, Agni is the leader of the divine hosts;'--'this sacrificer of the human;' for that community wherein he sacrifices is behind (inferior to) him; wherefore he says, 'This sacrificer (is the head) of the human.' 'May the household of these two shine brightly, not (like a cart yoked) with one bullock, for a hundred winters,--two yoke-fellows!' whereby he means to say, 'May their household matters be free from calamities for a hundred years .'
7	4	11	'Uniting blessings, not uniting bodies;' whereby he means to say, 'Unite ye your blessings only, but not also your bodies;' for were they also to unite their bodies, Agni (the fire) would burn the sacrificer. Now when this one sacrifices in the fire, he gives gifts to Agni; and whatever blessing the priests here invoke upon the sacrificer, all that Agni accomplishes. Thus they unite only their blessings, but not also their bodies: wherefore he says, 'Uniting blessings, not uniting bodies.'
8	1	1	Thereupon the Hotri, having sat down on the Hotri's seat whereon he sits down after being chosen ,urges, and thus urged the Adhvaryu takes the two spoons.
8	1	2	They then proceed with the Âprî (verses). The reason why they proceed with the Âprîs is this. With his whole mind, with his whole self, forsooth, he who consecrates himself prepares and endeavours to prepare the sacrifice. His self is, as it were, emptied out; with those Âprîs they fill it again; and because they fill  it therewith, therefore they are called Âprî. For this reason they proceed with the Âprîs.
8	1	3	Now there are here eleven fore-offerings; for here in man there are ten vital airs, and the eleventh is the self wherein those vital airs are contained; this is the whole man; thus they fill his whole self, and therefore there are eleven fore-offerings.
8	1	4	[The Adhvaryu] having called (on the Âgnîdhra) for the Sraushat, he says (to the Maitrâvaruna), 'Prompt (the Hotri to recite to) the kindling-sticks !' Thus he proceeds with ten fore-offerings,saying, 'Prompt . . .' at each, and pouring the ghee together at every fourth fore-offering . Having performed ten fore-offerings, he says, 'Bring the slayer!' 'Slayer,' namely, the (butcher's) knife is called.
8	1	5	He then takes the (svaru) chip of the sacrificial stake, and having anointed both (the slaughtering-knife and the chip) at the top (with ghee) from the guhû-spoon, he touches the forehead of the victim with them, saying , 'Anointed with ghee, protect ye the animals!' for the chip of the stake is a thunderbolt, and the slaughtering-knife is a thunderbolt, and ghee is a thunderbolt; having thus fitted together the entire thunderbolt  he appoints it the keeper of this (victim), lest the evil spirits should injure it. He again conceals the chip of the stake (under the girding-rope of the stake). In handing the slaughtering-knife to the butcher, he says, 'Be this thine approved edge!' and deposits the two spoons.
8	1	6	Thereupon he says (to the Hotri), 'Recite to Agni circumambient !' Having taken a firebrand,the Agnîdh carries the fire round (the victim). Why he carries the fire round, is that he encircles it (the victim) by means of the fire with an unbroken fence, lest the evil spirits should seize upon it; for Agni is the repeller of the Rakshas; therefore he carries the fire round. He carries it round the place where they cook it (the victim ).
8	1	7	As to this they say, 'Let him take back that firebrand (to the Âhavanîya); and having there (at the Sâmitra) churned out a new fire, let them cook it (the victim) thereon. For this (firebrand), surely, is âhavanîya (fit to offer upon); it is not for the purpose that they should cook uncooked (food) thereon, but for this that they should sacrifice cooked (food) thereon.'
8	1	8	Let him, however, not do this. For in that he carries fire round it, it (the victim) becomes as food swallowed by that (firebrand), and it would be as if he were to seize and tear out food that has been swallowed and offer it to some one else; let them, therefore, crumble some coals off that same firebrand, and thereon cook that (victim).
8	1	9	Thereupon the Agnîdh, taking a (new) firebrand, walks in front: whereby he places Agni in front, thinking, 'Agni shall repel the evil spirits in front!' andthey lead the victim after him (to the slaughtering-place) on a (way) free from danger and injury. The Pratiprasthâtri holds on to it from behind by means of the two spits , and the Adhvaryu (holds on to) the Pratiprasthâtri, and the Sacrificer to the Adhvaryu.
8	1	10	As to this they say, 'That (victim) must not be held on to by the sacrificer, for they lead it unto death; therefore let him not hold on to it.' But let him nevertheless hold on to it; for that (victim) which they lead to the sacrifice they lead not to death; therefore let him hold on to it. Moreover he would cut himself off from the sacrifice, were he not to hold on to it; therefore let him hold on to it. It is held on to in a mysterious way; by means of the spits the Pratiprasthâtri (holds on to it); to the Pratiprasthâtri the Adhvaryu, to the Adhvaryu the Sacrificer; thus then it is held on to in a mysterious way.
8	1	11	Thereupon the Adhvaryu takes two stalks of grass from the covered altar, and having called for the Sraushat, he says (to the Maitrâvaruna), 'O Hotri, prompt again (the Hotri to recite for) the offerings to the gods !' This is what belongs to the All-gods at the animal offering.
8	1	12	He then makes (the Sacrificer) say the text , 'O thou prosperous! uponthe Sacrificer,'--the prosperous one, forsooth, is Speech, it is because she speaks much, that Speech is prosperous,--'bestow thou what is agreeable unto him! Approach thou,'--thereby he means to say, 'Approach thou an existence free from affliction,'--'from the wide air, along with the divine wind;' for the Rakshas moves about the air rootless and unfettered on both sides, even as man here moves about the air rootless and unfettered on both sides: he means to say, 'Meeting together with the wind, protect thou this one from the wide air,' when he says 'from the wide air, along with the divine wind.'
8	1	13	'Offer thou with the self of this oblation!' whereby he means to say to Speech, 'Offer thou with the soul of this unblemished oblation;'--'Unite thou with its body!' whereby he means to say to Speech, 'Unite thou with the body of this unblemished oblation!'
8	1	14	In front  of the place where they cut it up, he throws down a stalk of grass, with, 'O great one, lead the lord of sacrifice unto greater sacrifice!' he thus strews barhis (an underlayer of sacrificial grass) for it, that no sacrificial food may be spilt; whatever may now be spilt of it when it is cut up, that settles thereon and thus is not lost.
8	1	15	They then step back (to the altar) and sit down turning towards the Âhavanîya, 'lest they should be eye-witnesses to its being quieted (strangled).' They do not slay it on the frontal bone , for that is humanmanner; nor behind the ear, for that is after the manner of the Fathers. They either choke it by merely keeping its mouth closed, or they make a noose. Therefore he says not, 'Slay! kill!' for that is human manner, but, 'Quiet it! It has passed away!' for that is after the manner of the gods. For when he says, 'It has passed away,' then this one (the Sacrificer) passes away to the gods: therefore he says, 'It has passed away.'
8	1	16	When they hold it down, then, before the strangling, he offers with 'Hail, to the gods!' And when (the butcher) says, 'Quieted is the victim,' he offers with, 'To the gods, Hail!' Thus some of the gods are preceded by 'Hail,' and others followed by 'Hail;' he thereby gratifies them, and thus gratified both kinds of gods convey him to the heavenly world. These are the so-called 'paripasavya ' oblations; he may offer them if he choose; or, if he choose, he need not mind them.
8	2	1	When he (the slaughterer) announces, 'The victim has been quieted!' the Adhvaryu says, 'Neshtar, lead up the lady!' The Neshtri leads up the (sacrificer's) wife bearing a vessel of water for washing the feet.
8	2	2	He makes her say , 'Homage be to thee, O wide-stretched!'--the wide-stretched one, forsooth, is the sacrifice; for they stretch the sacrifice (over the sacrificial ground):hence the wide-stretched one is the sacrifice. But that wife, forsooth, is the hind-part of the sacrifice, and he wants her, thus coming forward, to propitiate the sacrifice. Thereby, then, she makes amends to that sacrifice, and thus that sacrifice does not injure her: therefore she says, 'Homage be to thee, O wide-stretched!'
8	2	3	'Advance, unresisted!' whereby she means to say, 'Advance on (a way) free from injury!' 'Unto the rivers of ghee, along the paths of sacred truth!' whereby she means to say, 'Unto good.' [Vâg. S. VI,
8	2	13	], 'Ye divine, pure waters, carry ye (the sacrifice) to the gods, well-prepared! May we be well-prepared preparers!' Thereby she purifies the water.
8	2	4	Thereupon the wife cleanses with the water the (openings of the) vital airs of the victim. The reason why she thus cleanses with water the (openings of the) vital airs is this: the food of the gods is living, is immortal (ambrosia) for the immortals; but in quieting and cutting up that victim they kill it. Now the vital airs are water; hence she now puts into it those vital airs, and thus that food of the gods becomes truly living, becomes immortal for the immortals.
8	2	5	Then as to why it is the wife that cleanses. The wife is a woman, and from woman progeny is born here on earth; thus he causes that (creature) to be born from that woman; and therefore the wife cleanses (the victim).
8	2	6	With  'Thy speech I cleanse' she wipes the mouth; with 'Thy breath I cleanse,' the nostrils; with 'Thine eye I cleanse,' the eyes; with 'Thine organ of hearing I cleanse,' theears; with 'Thy navel I cleanse,' that mysterious (opening of a) vital air; or with 'Thy sexual organ I cleanse;' with 'Thy hind-part I cleanse,' that (opening of a) vital air behind. Thus she puts the vital airs into it, revives it. Thereupon, holding the legs together, (she wipes them) with 'Thy feet I cleanse;' for it is on its feet chat it stands firmly; she thus makes it stand (on its feet) for the sake of a firm position.
8	2	7	With one half or the whole of the water that is left, he (the Adhvaryu) and the Sacrificer  then sprinkle it, beginning from the head; thereby they put those vital airs into it, and revive it (beginning) from that part.
8	2	8	Thus, wherever they wound it , wherever they hurt it--water being a means of soothing--there they soothe it by that means of soothing, water, there they heal it with water.
8	2	9	They sprinkle with , 'May thy mind grow full! may thy speech grow full! may thy breath grow full! may thine eye grow full! may thine ear grow full!' Thus they put the vital airs into it and revive it: 'Whatever is sore, whatever hurt in thee, may that fill up and become firm.'
8	2	10	Thus, wherever they wound it, wherever they hurt it--water being a means of soothing--they soothe it by that means of soothing, water, therethey heal it with water: 'May that become pure in thee!' thereby they render it sacrificially pure. With 'Auspicious be the days!' they pour out (the remaining water) behind the victim.
8	2	11	Thus, wherever they wound it, wherever they hurt it,--lest thereafter the days and nights should be inauspicious ,--they pour out (the water) behind the victim with, 'Auspicious be the days.'
8	2	12	Thereupon they turn the victim over so as to lie on its back. He (the Adhvaryu) puts the (other) stalk of grass thereon, with, 'O plant, protect!' for the knife is a thunderbolt, and thus that thunderbolt, the knife, does not injure it (the victim). He then applies the edge of the knife to it (and cuts through it) with, 'Injure it not, O blade!' for the knife is a thunderbolt, and thus that thunderbolt, the knife, does not injure it.
8	2	13	He applies that approved edge of his, for that has been made sacrificially pure by a text . That which is the top part of the stalk he puts in his left hand, and that which is the bottom part he takes with his right hand.
8	2	14	And where he skins (the victim), and whence the blood spirts out, there he smears it (the bottom part with blood) on both ends with , 'Thou art the Rakshas' share!' for that blood is indeed the Rakshas' share.
8	2	15	Having thrown it away (on the utkara), he treads on it with, 'Herewith I tread down the Rakshas! herewith I drive away the Rakshas! herewith I consign the Rakshas to thenethermost darkness!' Thus it is by means of the sacrifice that he drives away the evil spirits, the Rakshas. And as to its being rootless and severed on both sides,--rootless, forsooth, and severed on both sides, the Rakshas moves about in the air, even as man here moves about in the air rootless and severed on both sides: therefore it (the grass-end) is rootless and severed on both sides.
8	2	16	Thereupon they pull out the omentum, and envelop the two spits  therein with, 'May ye envelop heaven and earth with ghee!' whereby he endows those two, heaven and earth, with strength and sap, and puts strength and sap into them; and upon those two, thus filled with sap and affording the means of subsistence, these creatures subsist.
8	2	17	The two omentum-spits are made of kârshmarya wood. For when the gods in the beginning seized (slew) a victim, then, as it was drawn upwards, its sacrificial essence  flowed downwards, and from it sprang a tree; and because it flowed down from the (victim) as it was drawn (karsh) upwards, therefore (it became) a kârshmarya tree . With thatsame sacrificial essence he now perfects it, and makes it whole; therefore the two omentum-spits are of kârshmarya wood.
8	2	18	He cuts it (the omentum) off on all sides (from the belly) and heats it at the cooking-fire: thus it becomes cooked for him already at this (fire) . The Agnîdh again takes a firebrand (from the Sâmitra, and walks in front). They go behind the pit (kâtvâla) and proceed to the Âhavanîya. The Adhvaryu throws that (top part of the) grass-stalk into the Âhavanîya with, 'O Vâyu, graciously accept the drops!' for this is the kindler (samidh) of the drops .
8	2	19	Thereupon he heats the omentum while standing on the north side; for he is about to pass by the fire and to roast (the omentum) after walking round to the south side. Hereby then he propitiates it, and thus that fire does not injure him while passing by; this is why he heats the omentum while standing on the north side.
8	2	20	They take it along between the sacrificial stake and the fire. The reason why they do not take it across the middle (of the altar) , where they take other sacrificial dishes, is lest they should bring the sacrifice in the middle into contact with the uncooked (omentum). And why they do not take it there outside (the altar) along the front of the sacrificial stake, is that they would thereby put it outside the sacrifice; therefore they take it alongbetween the sacrificial stake and the fire. Having gone round to the south side, the Pratiprasthâtri roasts it.
8	2	21	Thereupon the Adhvaryu, having taken ghee with the dipping-spoon, pours it upon the omentum, with, 'May Agni graciously accept the ghee, Hail!' Thus those drops thereof reach the fire after becoming cooked offerings, made with Svâhâ (hail)!
8	2	22	He then says (to the Maitrâvaruna ), 'Recite to the drops!' He recites to the drops verses addressed to Agni . The reason why he recites to the drops verses addressed to Agni, is that rain originates from gifts made from this earth, for from here it is that Agni obtains the rain; by means of these drops (falling from the omentum) he obtains those (rain) drops, and those drops rain down; therefore he recites to the drops verses addressed to Agni. When it is roasted,--
8	2	23	The Pratiprasthâtri says, 'It is roasted: proceed !' The Adhvaryu, having taken the two spoons and stept across (to the north side of the fire) and called for the Sraushat, says (to the Maitrâvaruna), 'Prompt for the Svâhâs !' and offers (the ghee) when the Vashat has been pronounced .
8	2	24	Having offered, he bastes first the omentum, then the clotted ghee. Now the Karaka-Adhvaryus, forsooth, baste first the clotted ghee, arguing that the clotted ghee is the breath; and a Karaka-Adhvaryu, forsooth, cursed Yâgñavalkya for so doing, saying, 'That Adhvaryu has shut out the breath; the breath shall depart from him!'
8	2	25	But he, looking at his arms, said, 'These hoary arms--what in the world has become of the Brâhman's word !' Let him not heed that (objection of the Karakas); for this is the last fore-offering,--and this being a havis-offering, at the last fore-offering he first pours ghee into the dhruvâ, being about to offer the first two butter-portions with it . Now, on the present occasion, he will first offer the omentum; therefore let him first baste the omentum, then the clotted ghee. And though he does not baste the victim with ghee, 'lest he should baste the uncooked,' that whole victim of his yet becomes (as it were) basted with ghee in that he bastes the omentum; let him therefore first baste the omentum, then the clotted ghee.
8	2	26	Thereupon he makes an 'underlayer' of ghee (in the guhû-spoon), and lays a piece of gold thereon. Then, cutting off the omentum (from the spits and putting it into the spoon), he says (to the Hotri), 'Recite (the invitatory prayer) to Agni and Somafor the omentum and fat of the buck!' He then lays (another) piece of gold on (the omentum) and bastes it twice with ghee above.
8	2	27	The reason why there is a piece of gold on both sides is this. When they offer the victim in the fire they slay it; and gold means immortal life: hence it (the victim) rests in immortal life. And so it rises from hence, and so it lives; for this reason there is a piece of gold  on both sides. Having called for the Sraushat, he says (to the Maitrâvaruna), 'Prompt (the Hotri to recite the offering-prayer  on) the omentum and fat of the buck for Agni and Soma!' He does not say, '. . . (the omentum and fat) brought forward;' when the Soma has been pressed he says, 'brought forward .' He offers when the Vashat has been pronounced.
8	2	28	Having offered the omentum, he lays the two spits together and throws them after (the omentum into the fire), with, 'Consecrated by Svâhâ, go ye to Ûrdhvanabhas , son of the Maruts!' He does so, thinking, 'Lest these two wherewith we have cooked the omentum should come to nought.'
8	2	29	The reason why they perform with the omen-tum is this. For whatever deity the victim is seized, that same deity he pleases by means of that fat (part); and that same deity, thus pleased with that fat, waitspatiently for the other sacrificial dishes being cooked; this is why they perform with the omentum.
8	2	30	They then cleanse themselves over the pit . For in quieting and cutting up (the victim) they wound it; and water being a means of soothing, they now soothe it by means of water, heal it by means of water; therefore they cleanse themselves over the pit.
8	3	1	For the same deity for which there is a victim, he subsequently prepares a sacrificial cake . The reason why he subsequently prepares a cake is this. Rice and barley, truly, are the sacrificial essence of all animals (victims) ; with that same essence he now completes that (victim) and makes it whole. This is why he subsequently prepares a sacrificial cake.
8	3	2	And why he proceeds with that cake after performing (offering) with the omentum is this. It is from the middle (of the victim) that this omentum is pulled out, and from the middle he now completes that (victim) by means of that sacrificial essence and makes it whole; therefore he proceeds with that cake after performing with the omentum. The relation ofthis (cake to the animal offering), indeed, is one and the same everywhere; that cake is prepared after (and supplementary to) a victim.
8	3	3	Thereupon he cuts up the victim: 'Move thrice , and make the heart the uppermost of the thrice-moved!' thus (he says to the slaughterer), for threefold is the sacrifice.
8	3	4	He then instructs the slaughterer: 'If one ask thee, "Is the sacrificial food cooked, O Samitar?" say thou only "Cooked!" not "Cooked, reverend sir!" nor "Cooked, forsooth!"'
8	3	5	Having then taken clotted ghee with the guhû, the Adhvaryu, stepping up (from the altar) to (the Sâmitra), asks, 'Is the sacrificial food cooked, O Sâmitar?' 'Cooked,' he says. 'That is of the gods,' says the Adhvaryu in a low voice.
8	3	6	The reason why he asks is this. Cooked, forsooth, not uncooked (must be) the gods' food; and the Samitri indeed knows whether it is cooked or uncooked.
8	3	7	And again, why he asks. 'I will perform with cooked (food),' so he thinks; and if that sacrificial food be uncooked, it is yet cooked food for the gods, and is cooked as regards the Sacrificer; and the Adhvaryu is guiltless; on the slaughterer that guilt lies. Thrice he asks, for threefold is the sacrifice. And as to his saying, 'That is of the gods,' that which is cooked, indeed, belongs to the gods; therefore he says, 'That is of the gods.'
8	3	8	The heart he bastes (with clotted ghee) first of all; for the heart is the self (soul), the mind; and the clotted ghee is the breath; he thus puts the breath into its (the victim's) self, into its mind; and thus it verily becomes the living food of the gods, and immortal for the immortals.
8	3	9	He bastes it with , 'May thy mind unite with the mind; thy breath with the breath!' He utters no Svâhâ ('hail'), for this is not an oblation. They remove the victim (from the cooking-fire) .
8	3	10	'They take it along the back of the pit, andbetween the sacrificial stake and the (Âhavanîya) fire. The reason why, though it is cooked, they do not take it across the middle (of the altar), as they take other sacrificial dishes, is 'lest they should bring the sacrifice in the middle in connection with that which is cut up by limbs and mangled.' And why they do not take it outside (the altar) in front of the stake, is that they would thereby put it outside the sacrifice: therefore they take (the flesh) along between the stake and the fire. When they have put it down south (of the fire), the Pratiprasthâtri cuts off (the portions). There are Plaksha branches  (Ficus Infectoria) by way of an upper barhis (covering of altar); thereon he cuts. The reason why there are Plaksha branches by way of an upper barhis is this.
8	3	11	For when the gods, at first, seized an animal to sacrifice), Tvashtri first spat upon its head, thinking, 'Surely, thus they will not touch it!' for animals belong to Tvashtri. That (spittle became) the brain in the head and the marrow in the neck-bone : hence that (substance) is like spittle, for Tvashtri spat it. Let him therefore not eat that, since it was spitten by Tvashtri.
8	3	12	Its sacrificial essence flowed down and there a tree sprang up. The gods beheld it; wherefore it (was called) 'prakhya' (visible), for 'plaksha,'doubtless, is the same as 'prakhya.' With that same sacrificial essence he now completes it (the victim), and makes it whole: hence there are Plaksha branches as an upper covering.
8	3	13	He then makes an 'underlayer' of ghee both in the guhû and the upabhrit, and in the vasâhomahavanî , and the samavattadhânî ; and puts a piece of gold  both in the guhû and the upabhrit.
8	3	14	Thereupon he addresses (the Hotri) for the recitation on the havis to the manotâ deity . The reason why he addresses him for the recitation on the havis to the manotâ deity is this. All the deities draw nigh to the victim while it is immolated, thinking, 'My name he will choose, my name he will choose!' for the animal victim is sacrificial food for all deities. The minds (manas), then, of all those deities are, fixed upon (ota) that victim; those (minds of theirs) he thereby satisfies, and thus the minds of the gods have not drawn nigh in vain. For this reason he addresses him for the recitation on the havis to the manotâ deity.
8	3	15	He first makes a portion of the heart . The reason why he first makes a portion of the heart which is in the middle, is that the heart is the breath, since it is from there that this breath moves upward ; and the animal is breath, for only so long does the animal (live) as it breathes with the breath; but when the breath departs from it, it lies there useless, even (as) a block of wood.
8	3	16	The heart, then, is the animal; thus he first makes a portion of its very self (or soul). And, accordingly, if any portion were omitted, he need not heed this, since it is of his entire animal victim that the first portion is made which is made of the heart. He therefore first makes a portion of the heart, that being in the middle. Thereupon according to the proper order.
8	3	17	Then of the tongue, for that stands out from its fore-part. Then of the breast, for that also (stands out) therefrom . Then of the simultaneously moving (left) fore-foot . Then of the flanks. Then of the liver. Then of the kidneys.
8	3	18	The hind-part he divides into three parts; the broad piece (he reserves) for the by-offerings ; the middle one he cuts into the guhû after dividing it in two; the narrow piece (he reserves) for thetryaṅga . Then of the simultaneously moving (right) haunch . This much, then, he cuts into the guhû.
8	3	19	Then into the upabhrit, he makes a portion of the upper part of the fore-foot belonging to the tryaṅga (viz. the right one); of the (narrow piece of the) hind-part, after dividing it in two; and of the haunch belonging to the tryaṅga (viz. the left). Thereupon he puts two pieces of gold on (the flesh oblations in the spoons) and pours ghee thereon.
8	3	20	He then takes the oblation of gravy  with , 'Thou art trembling,' for quivering, as it were, is the broth: hence he says, 'Thou art trembling;'--'May Agni prepare  thee!' for the fire does indeed cook it: hence he says, 'May Agni prepare thee!'--'The waters have washed thee together,' for the water indeed gathers together that (fat) juice from the limbs: hence he says, 'The waters have washed thee together.'
8	3	21	'For the sweeping of the wind--thee!' for verily yonder blower sweeps along the air, and for the air he takes it: hence he says, 'For the sweeping of the wind (I take) thee.'
8	3	22	'For the speed of Pûshan,'--Pûshan's speed, forsooth, is yonder (wind) , and for that he takes it: hence he says, 'For the speed of Pûshan.'
8	3	23	'From the hot vapour may totter--;' the hot vapour, namely, is yonder (wind), and for that he takes it: hence he says, 'From the hot vapour may totter--.' Thereupon he bastes it twice with ghee above.
8	3	24	He then mixes it either with the crooked knife or with the chopping-knife , with '--Confounded hatred !' whereby he chases away from here those evil spirits, the Rakshas.
8	3	25	The broth which is left he pours into the Samavattadhânî, and therein he throws the heart, tongue, breast, the broad piece (of the back part), the kidneys, and the rectum. He then bastes it twice with ghee above.
8	3	26	The reason why there is a piece of gold on each side is this. When they offer up the victim in the fire, they slay it, and gold means immortal life: thereby then it rests in immortal life; and so it rises from hence, and so it lives. This is why there is a piece of gold on each side.
8	3	27	And because he cuts crossways,--of the left fore-foot and the right haunch; and of the right forefoot and the left haunch,--therefore this animal draws forward its feet crossways. But were he to cut straight on, this animal would draw forward its feet (of the same side) simultaneously: therefore he cuts crossways. Then as to why he does not make cuttings of the head, nor the shoulders, nor the neck, nor the hind-thighs.
8	3	28	Now the Asuras, in the beginning, seized a victim. The gods, from fear, did not go near it . The Earth  then said unto them, 'Heed ye not this: I will myself be an eye-witness thereof, in whatsoever manner they will perform this (offering).'
8	3	29	She said, 'Only one oblation have they offered, the other they have left over.' Now that which they left over are these same portions. Thereupon the gods made over three limbs to (Agni) Svishtakrit, whence the Tryaṅga oblations. The Asuras then made portions of the head, the shoulders, the neck, and the hind-thighs: therefore let him not make portions of these. And since Tvashtri spat upon the neck, therefore let him not make a portion of the neck. Thereupon he says (to the Hotri), 'Recite (the invitatory prayer) to Agni and Soma for the havis of the buck!' Having called for the Sraushat, he says (to the Maitrâvaruna), 'Prompt (the Hotri to recite the offering-prayer  for) the havis of the buck to Agni and Soma!' He does not say '(the havis) made ready:' when the Soma has been pressed he says 'made ready.'
8	3	30	In the interval between the two half-verses of the offering-prayer he offers the oblation of gravy. It is from out of this that that essence (juice) has risen upwards here,--that sap of this earth whereby creatures exist on this side of the sky ; for theoblation of gravy is sap, and essence is sap: thus he renders the sap strong by means of sap, whence this sap when eaten does not perish.
8	3	31	And as to why he offers the oblation of gravy in the interval between the two half-verses of the offering-prayer,--one half-verse, forsooth, is this earth, and the other half-verse is yonder sky. Now between the sky and the earth is the air, and it is to the air that he offers: therefore he offers the oblation of gravy between the two half-verses of the offering-prayer.
8	3	32	He offers with , 'Drink the ghee, ye drinkers of ghee! Drink the gravy, ye drinkers of gravy! thou art the havis of the air, Hail!' With this prayer to the All-gods he offers, for the air belongs to the All-gods: because creatures move about here in the air breathing in and breathing out therewith, therefore it belongs to the All-gods. As the Vashat (of the offering-prayer for the meat portions) is pronounced, he offers the portions that are in the guhû.
8	3	33	Thereupon, while taking clotted ghee with the guhû, he says (to the Hotri), 'Recite (the invitatory prayer) to the Lord of the forest!' Having called for the Sraushat, he says (to the Maitrâvaruna), 'Prompt (the Hotri to recite the offering-prayer) to the lord of the forest!' and offers, as the Vashat is pronounced . The reason why he offers to the lord of the forest (the tree) is,--he thereby makes that thunderbolt, the sacrificial stake, a sharer (in the sacrifice); and, the lord of the forest being Soma ,he thereby makes the victim to be Soma. And as to his offering (to the tree) between the two oblations, he thus fills both completely: therefore he offers between the two oblations.
8	3	34	Thereupon, while pouring together the meat portions that are for the upabhrit, he says (to the Hotri), 'Recite (the invitatory prayer) to Agni Svishtakrit (the maker of good offering)!' Having called for the Sraushat, he says (to the Maitrâvaruna), 'Prompt for Agni Svishtakrit!' and offers as the Vashat is pronounced.
8	3	35	With what is left of the offering of gravy, he then sprinkles the quarters, with, 'The regions,--the fore-regions,--the by-regions,--the intermediate regions,--the upper regions,--to the regions, Hail!' For the offering of gravy is sap: thus he imbues all the regions with sap, and hence sap is obtained here on earth in every region.
8	3	36	Thereupon he touches (what remains of) the victim : now is the time for the touching. And whether he has touched it before, fearing 'those (evil spirits) that hover near will tear it about,' or whether he be not afraid  of its being torn about, let him in any case now touch (the victim).
8	3	37	[Vâg. S. VI,
8	3	20	], 'To Indra belongeth the out-breathing: may it attend  to every limb! To Indra belongeth the in-breathing: it is attended to in every limb.' Where it has been cut up limb by limb, there he heals it by means of the out-breathing and in-breathing.--'O divine Tvashtri, let thine ample (forms) closely unite together, that it be uniform what is of different shape:' whereby he makes it completely enclosed (in its limbs and flesh). 'May thy friends, thy father and mother , to please thee, joyfully welcome thee going to the gods!' Thus, having made it whole wherever he has offered (a piece of) it, he afterwards unites it firmly, and that body (self) of it is complete in yonder world.
8	4	1	Now there are three elevens at the animal offering,--eleven fore-offerings, eleven after-offerings, and eleven by-offerings: ten fingers, ten toes, ten vital airs, and the out-breathing, in-breathing and through-breathing--this much constitutes man, who is the highest of animals, after whom  are all animals.
8	4	2	Now they say,' What, then, is done at the sacrifice whereby the vital air is kindly to all the limbs?'
8	4	3	When he divides the hind-part into three portions,--the hind-part being (an opening of the) vital air, and that (animal) extending from thence forward, that vital air pervades it all through.
8	4	4	And in that he cuts the hind-part into three portions,--one third for the by-offerings, one third into the guhû, and one third into the upabhrit,--thereby the vital air is kindly to all the limbs.
8	4	5	He alone, however, may slay an animal who can supply it with the sacrificial essence . And if it be lean, let him stuff into the hind-part whatever may be left of the fat of the belly: the hind-part being (an opening of) the vital air, and that (animal) extending from thence forward, that vital air pervades it all through. The animal, forsooth, is breath; for only so long (does) the animal (live), as it breathes with the breath; but when the breath departs from it, it lies there useless, even (as) a block of wood.
8	4	6	The hind-part is (part of) the animal, and fat means sacrificial essence : thus he supplies it with the sacrificial essence. But if it be tender (juicy), then it has itself obtained the sacrificial essence.
8	4	7	Thereupon he takes clotted ghee; for twofold indeed is this (clotted ghee),--to wit, both gheeand sour milk ,--and a productive union means a couple: thus a productive union is thereby effected.
8	4	8	Therewith they perform at the after-offerings. The after-offerings mean cattle, and clotted ghee means milk: hence he thereby puts milk into the cattle, and thus milk is here contained (or beneficial, Nita) in the cattle; for clotted ghee means breath, because clotted ghee is food, and breath is food.
8	4	9	Therewith he (the Adhvaryu) performs in front (on the Âhavanîya) at the after-offerings,---whereby he puts into (the victim) that vital air which is here in front;--and therewith he (the Pratiprasthâtri) performs behind (the altar) at the by-offerings ,--whereby he puts into it that vital air which is here behind: thus two vital airs are here contained (or beneficial) on both sides, the one above and the one below.
8	4	10	Here now, one (Hotri) pronounces the Vashat for two,--for the Adhvaryu (who performs the after-offerings)and for him (the Pratiprasthâtri) who performs the by-offerings. And because he offers them by (in addition to) the offering (Adhvaryu), therefore they are called by-offerings. And in performing the by-offerings, he produces (offspring) , since he performs the by-offerings behind (the altar), and from behind offspring is produced from woman.
8	4	11	He offers the by-offerings with , 'Go thou to the sea, Hail!' The sea is water, and seed is water: he thereby casts seed.
8	4	12	'Go thou to the air, Hail!' It is into (along) the air that offspring is born: into the air he produces (offspring).
8	4	13	'Go thou to the divine Savitri, Hail!' Savitri is the impeller of the gods: impelled by Savitri he thus produces creatures.
8	4	14	'Go thou to Mitra and Varuna, Hail!' Mitra and Varuna are the out-breathing and in-breathing: he thus bestows out-breathing and in-breathing on the creatures.
8	4	15	'Go thou to the day and the night, Hail! It is through (along) day and night that offspring is born: through day and night he causes creatures to be born.
8	4	16	'Go thou to the metres, Hail!' There are seven metres; and there are seven domestic and seven wild animals: both kinds he thus causes to be produced.
8	4	17	'Go thou to heaven and earth, Hail!' For, Pragâpati, having created the living beings,enclosed them between heaven and earth, and so these beings are enclosed between heaven and earth. And in like manner does this (offerer), having created living beings, enclose them between heaven and earth.
8	4	18	He then makes additional by-offerings (atiupayag). Were he not to make additional by-offerings, there would only be as many living beings as were created in the beginning; they would not be propagated; but by making additional by-offerings he indeed propagates them; whence creatures are again born here repeatedly .
8	5	1	He makes the additional by-offerings:--with 'Go thou to the sacrifice , Hail!' The sacrifice is water, and seed is water: he thus casts seed.
8	5	2	'Go thou to Soma, Hail!' Soma is seed: he thus casts seed.
8	5	3	'Go thou to the heavenly ether, Hail!' The heavenly ether is water, and seed is water: he thus casts seed.
8	5	4	'Go thou to Agni Vaisvânara, Hail!' Agni Vaisvânara ('belonging to all men') is this earth, and she is a safe resting-place: upon that safe resting-place he thus produces (creatures).
8	5	5	He then touches his mouth, with, 'Give me mind and heart!' thus indeed the by-offerer does not throw himself after (the oblations into the fire).
8	5	6	Thereupon  they perform the Patnîsamyâgaswith the tail (of the victim), for the tail is the hind-part, and from the hind-part of woman offspring is produced: hence offspring is produced by the Patnîsamyâgas being performed with the tail.
8	5	7	For the wives of the gods he cuts portions from the inside, since it is from the inside of woman that offspring is produced; for Agni the householder from above, since it is from above that the male approaches the female.
8	5	8	Thereupon they betake themselves, with the heart-spit, to the purificatory bath . Now, the anguish of the victim, in being slaughtered, concentrates itself into the heart, and from the heart into the heart-spit; and whatever part of cooked (food) is pierced that becomes palatable : therefore let him roast it on the spit after piercing it. Uppermost on the thrice-moved (portions of the) victim he places that heart after pulling it off (the spit).
8	5	9	He (the slaughterer) then hands the heart-spit (to the Adhvaryu). Let him not throw it on theground, nor into the water; for were he to throw it on the ground, that anguish would enter into the plants and trees; and were he to throw it into the water, that anguish would enter into the water: hence neither on the ground, nor into the water.
8	5	10	But on going down to the water, let him bury it at the place where the dry and the moist meet. But if he feel disinclined to going down (to the water), he pours out a vessel of water in front of the sacrificial stake and buries (the spit) at the place where the dry and the moist meet, with , 'Injure thou not the waters nor the plants!' thus it injures neither the waters nor the plants; 'From every fetter --therefrom deliver us, O king Varuna! That they say, we swear by the "Inviolable (cows)," by "Varuna ,"therefrom deliver us, O Varuna!' Thereby he delivers him  from every noose of Varuna, from all (guilt) against Varuna.
8	5	11	He then addresses (the water)  with, 'May the waters and plants be friendly unto us, unfriendly to him who hateth us, and whom we hate!' For when they proceed with that (spit), the waters, forsooth, as well as the plants, keep as it were receding from him; but hereby he now makes a covenant with them, and so they again approach to him, and that expiation is performed (to them). He does not perform (the spit-bath) at the animal offering to Agni and Soma, nor at that to Agni, but only at that of the Anûbandhyâ-cow , for therewith the whole sacrifice attains to completion. And in that they perform (the ceremony) with the heart-spit at the cow (offering), thereby indeed it comes to be performed also for the animal offering to Agni and Soma, as well as for that to Agni.
9	1	1	Now Pragâpati (the lord of creatures), having created living beings, felt himself as it were exhausted . The creatures turned away from him; the creatures  did not abide with him for his joy and food.
9	1	2	He thought within him, 'I have exhaustedmyself, and the object for which  I have created has not been accomplished: my creatures have turned away from me, the creatures have not abode with me for my joy and food.'
9	1	3	Pragâpati thought within him, 'How can I again strengthen myself: the creatures might then return to me; the creatures might abide with me for my joy and food!'
9	1	4	He went on praising and toiling, desirous of creatures (or progeny). He beheld that set of eleven (victims). By offering therewith Pragâpati again strengthened himself; the creatures returned to him, his creatures abode for his joy and food. By offering he truly became better.
9	1	5	Therefore, then, let him offer with the set of eleven (victims), for thus he truly strengthens himself by offspring and cattle the creatures turn unto him, the creatures abide with him for his joy and food;--he truly becomes better by offering: therefore, then, let him offer with the set of eleven (victims).
9	1	6	In the first place he seizes  a victim for Agni. For Agni is the head, the progenitor of the gods, he is the lord of creatures: and thereby the sacrificer truly becomes Agni's own.
9	1	7	Then one for Sarasvatî. For Sarasvatî is speech: by speech Pragâpati then again strengthened himself; speech turned unto him, speech he made subject to himself. And so does this one now become strong by speech, and speech turns unto him, and he makes speech subject to himself.
9	1	8	Then one for Soma. For Soma is food: byfood Pragâpati then again strengthened himself; food turned unto him, and he made food subject to himself. And so does this one now become strong by food; food turns unto him, and he makes food subject to himself.
9	1	9	And as to why it comes after that for Sarasvatî,--Sarasvatî is speech, and Soma is food: he who is incomplete by (having only) speech, now becomes indeed an eater of food.
9	1	10	Then one for Pûshan. For Pûshan means cattle; by means of cattle Pragâpati then again strengthened himself; cattle turned unto him, he made cattle subject to himself. And so does this one now become strong by means of cattle; the cattle turn unto him, and he makes the cattle subject to himself.
9	1	11	Then one for Brihaspati. For Brihaspati means the priesthood (brahman); by means of the priesthood Pragâpati then again strengthened himself; the priesthood turned unto him, he made the priesthood subject to himself. And so does this one now become strong by means of the Brahman; the priesthood turns unto him, he makes the priesthood subject to himself.
9	1	12	And as to why it comes after that for Pûshan,--Pûshan means cattle, and Brihaspati the priesthood; hence the Brâhmana (priest) has the most power over beasts, because they are placed in front (are protected) by him , because they are placed at the head (or in his mouth); thereforehaving given all that, he walks clad in sheepskin .
9	1	13	Then one for the Visve devâh. For the All-gods mean everything (or the All); with everything Pragâpati then again strengthened himself; everything turned unto him, and he made everything subject to him. And so does this one now become strong by everything; everything turns to him, and he makes everything subject to himself.
9	1	14	And as to why it comes after that for Brihaspati,--Brihaspati means the priesthood, and the All-gods this All; he then makes the priesthood the head of this All; wherefore the Brahman is the head of this All.
9	1	15	Then one for Indra. For Indra means power (indriya) and vigour; by power and vigour Pragâpati then again strengthened himself; power and vigour turned unto him, and he made power and vigour subject to himself. And so does this one now become strong by means of power and vigour; power and vigour turn to him, and he makes power and vigour subject to himself.
9	1	16	And as to why it comes after that for the All-gods,--Indra is the nobility, and the All-gods are the clans (people); he thus places the food before him.
9	1	17	Then one for the Maruts. For the Maruts mean the clans, and a clan means abundance; with abundance Pragâpati then again strengthened himself; abundance turned unto him, and he made abundance subject to himself. And so does this one now become strong by abundance; abundanceturns unto him, and he makes abundance subject to himself.
9	1	18	And as to why it comes after that for Indra,--Indra is the nobility, and the All-gods are the clans, and the Maruts are the clans; he thus guards the nobility by the clan, and hence the nobility here is on both sides guarded by the clan.
9	1	19	Then one for Indra and Agni. For Agni means penetrating brilliance, and Indra means power and vigour; with these two energies Pragâpati then again strengthened himself; both energies turned unto him, and he made both energies subject to himself. And so does this one now become strong by both these energies; both energies turn unto him, and he makes both energies subject to himself.
9	1	20	Then one for Savitri. For Savitri is the impeller (prasavitri) of the gods; and so all those wishes become accomplished for him, impelled as they are by Savitri.
9	1	21	Then finally he seizes one for Varuna; thereby he delivers him (the sacrificer) from every noose of Varuna, from every (guilt) against Varuna ,
9	1	22	Hence if there be eleven sacrificial stakes, let him bind Agni's (victim) to the one opposite the fire; and let them lead up the others one by one in the proper order.
9	1	23	But if there be eleven victims , let them only immolate at the stake that for Agni, and after that the others in the proper order.
9	1	24	When they lead them northwards, they lead the one for Agni first, and then the others in the proper order.
9	1	25	When they throw them down, they throw down first the one for Agni, as the southernmost; then the others after leading them round northwards in the proper order.
9	1	26	When they perform (offerings) with the omenta, they perform first with the omentum of Agni's (victim); then with those of the others in the proper order.
9	1	27	When they perform with those (chief oblations), they perform first with that to Agni; then with the others in the proper order.
9	2	1	Now, when the head of the sacrifice (victim) was struck off, its sap, running, entered the waters. It is by that very sap that those waters flow; that very sap is believed to be flowing there .
9	2	2	And when he goes for the Vasatîvarî water, he fetches that same sap and puts it into the sacrifice, and makes the sacrifice sapful; this is why he goes for the Vasatîvarî water.
9	2	3	He distributes it over all the Savanas (Soma-pressings) ; thereby he imbues all the pressingswith that sap, makes all the pressings sapful: this is why he distributes it over all the pressings.
9	2	4	Let him take it from flowing (water); for that sap of the sacrifice was moving : let him therefore take it from flowing (water).
9	2	5	Moreover, it is taken for the purpose of protection. Now, everything else here on earth, whatever it be, takes rest, even yonder blowing (wind); but these (waters) alone take no rest: therefore let him take it from flowing (water).
9	2	6	Let him take it by day, thinking, 'Seeing, I will take the sap of the sacrifice :' therefore let him take it by day. For it is for him that burns yonder (the sun) that he takes it, since he takes it for all the gods, and all the gods are his rays of light: therefore let him take it by day. For it is by day alone that he (shines): therefore, then, let him take it by day.
9	2	7	And again, all the gods, forsooth, now come to the sacrificer's house; and if one takes the Vasatîvarî water before the setting of the sun, it is as when one's better comes to visit one, he would honour him by trimming his house. They draw nigh to that sacrificial food, and abide (upa-vas) in that Vasatîvarî  water,--that is the Upavasatha (preparation-day).
9	2	8	And if the sun were to set on any one's (Vasatîvarîs) not having been taken, then expiation is made. If he have performed a (Soma-)sacrifice before this, let him (the Adhvaryu) take it from his tank , sincethat (water) of his has been taken before (sunset) by day. But should he not have offered before, if there be one who has offered (Soma) settled close by or somewhere thereabout , let him take it from his tank, since that (water) of his has been taken before, by day.
9	2	9	But if he cannot obtain either kind (of water), let him seize a firebrand and betake himself (to the flowing water), and let him take thereof while holding that (firebrand) close above it; or let him take it while holding a piece of gold close above it: thus it is made like yonder burning (sun).
9	2	10	He takes therefrom with the text , 'Rich in havis are these waters,'--for the sap of the sacrifice entered into them, wherefore he says, 'Rich in havis (sacrificial food) are these waters;'--'One rich in havis wooeth for (them),' for the sacrificer, rich in havis, woos for (wishes to obtain) them; wherefore he says, 'One rich in havis wooeth for (them).'
9	2	11	'Rich in havis (may be) the divine cult;' cult, namely, means the sacrifice; thus he makes the sacrifice for which he takes it rich in sacrificial food, therefore he says, 'Rich in havis is the divine cult.'
9	2	12	'May Sûrya be rich in havis!' For he takes it for yonder burning (sun), since he takes it for all the gods, and all the gods are his (the sun's) rays of light; therefore he says, 'May Sûrya (the sun) be rich in havis!'
9	2	13	Having fetched it, he deposits it behind the Gârhapatya , with , 'I seat you inthe seat of Agni, the safe-housed;' whereby he means to say, 'I seat you (waters) in the seat of Agni, whose house is unimpaired.' And when the animal offering to Agni and Soma comes to a close, then he carries (the Vasatîvarî water) round. He says (thrice), 'Disperse!' The sacrificer is seated in front of the Soma-carts (holding Soma on his lap ). He (the Adhvaryu) takes it (the water standing behind the Gârhapatya).
9	2	14	He walks out (of the hall) by the south (door), and puts it down on the south hip (of the high altar), with, 'Ye (waters) are Indra and Agni's share!' for he takes it for all the gods, and Indra and Agni are all the gods. He takes it up again and puts it down in front of the lady (who, seated behind the Gârhapatya, touches the water-jar). Walking round behind the lady he (again) takes it.
9	2	15	He walks out (of the hall by the east door), along the north side (of the altar), and puts down (the water) on the north hip (of the high altar), with, 'Ye are Mitra and Varuna's share!' Let him not put it down in this way  that is redundant, and no fitting conclusion is thus attained. Let him rather (here also) say, 'Ye are Indra and Agni's share!' only thus there is nothing redundant, and so a fitting conclusion is obtained.
9	2	16	That (Vasatîvarî water) is carried round for the sake of protection; Agni is in front (of the sacrificial ground), and now that (water) moves about all round, repelling the evil spirits. He puts itdown in the Âgnîdhra (fire-house) with, 'Ye are all the gods' share!' whereby he makes all the gods enter it. It is a desirable object (vara) to the dwellers (vasat), hence the name Vasatîvarî , and verily he who knows this, becomes a desirable object to the dwellers.
9	2	17	Now there are here seven formulas; with four he takes (the water), with one he puts it down behind the Gârhapatya, with one he carries it round, with one (he puts it down) in the Âgnîdhra,--this makes seven. For when the metres were produced from Vâk (speech), the one consisting of seven feet, the Sakvarî, was the last (highest) of them;--that completeness (he brings about): hence there are seven formulas.
9	3	1	They (the priests) are wakened (towards morning). Having touched water , they proceed together to the Âgnîdhra (fire-house) and take the portions of ghee (for the Savanîya animal offerings). Having taken the portions of ghee, they betake themselves (to the high altar). When they have deposited the ghee,--
9	3	2	He (the Adhvaryu) takes down the king (Soma) . Now this (earth) is a safe resting-place, and the birth-place of living beings; it is to this safe resting-place that he now takes him down; he spreads him thereon, produces him therefrom.
9	3	3	He takes him down between the shafts; for the cart is (a means of) the sacrifice, and thus alone he does not put him outside the sacrifice. He puts him on the pressing stones lying there with their heads (mukha, mouths)  towards each other; for Soma is the nobility, and the stones are the clans (people); he thereby raises the nobility over the clan. And as to why they are lying with their heads together,--he thereby makes the clan of one head (or mouth) with, and uncontentious towards, the nobles; therefore they are lying with their heads towards each other.
9	3	4	He takes (Soma) down, with , 'Thee for the heart, thee for the mind!' This he says for the (accomplishment of the) sacrificer's wish, since it is with the heart and mind that the sacrificer entertains the wish for which he sacrifices; therefore he says, 'Thee for the heart, thee for the mind!'
9	3	5	'Thee for the sky, thee for the sun!' This, on the other hand, he says with a view to the world of the gods. When he says, 'Thee for the sky, theefor the sun,' he means to say, 'Thee for the gods!' 'Upwards convey thou to the sky, to the gods, this cult, these invocations!' Cult, doubtless, means sacrifice: he thereby means to say, 'Upwards carry thou this sacrifice to the sky, to the gods!'
9	3	6	[Vâg. S. VI,
9	3	26	], 'O Soma, king, descend unto all thy people!' whereby he brings him down for the lordship, for the sovereignty of these people (creatures).
9	3	7	Having quitted his hold (of Soma) he sits down by him, with, 'May all thy people descend to thee.' Now, in saying, 'Descend unto all thy people,' he does what is unseemly, for Soma being the nobility, he thereby, as it were, confounds good and bad ,--and, indeed, in consequence thereof, people now confound good and bad. But in this (formula) he does what is right and according to order,--in saying, 'May all thy people descend to thee,' he makes all his subjects go down (on their knees) before him; and hence when a noble approaches, all these subjects, the people, go down before him, crouch down by him on the ground . Sitting near (Soma), the Hotri is about to recite the morning-prayer.
9	3	8	Then, while putting a kindling-stick (on the fire), he (the Adhvaryu) says, 'Recite to the godsthe early-coming!' Now the early-coming gods are the metres, as the after-offerings are the metres; and the after-offerings are performed with, 'Prompt (the Hotri to recite) to the gods! Recite (the offering-prayer) to the gods!'
9	3	9	And so some say, 'Recite to the gods !' But let him not say so; for the early-coming gods are the metres, as the after-offerings are the metres, and the after-offerings are performed with, 'Prompt--to the gods! Recite (the offering-prayer) to the gods!' therefore let him say, 'Recite to the gods, the early-coming!'
9	3	10	And when he puts on a kindling-stick, it is the metres he thereby kindles. And when the Hotri recites the morning-prayer , he therebyagain strengthens the metres, makes them to be of unimpaired vigour; for the metres had their vigour impaired by the gods, since it was through the metres that the gods reached the heavenly worlds; they neither sing praises (chants) nor recite (sastras) here. Hereby he now again strengthens the metres and makes them to be of unimpaired vigour; and by means of them, thus unimpaired in vigour, theyperform the sacrifice; this is why the Hotri recites the morning-prayer.
9	3	11	Here now they say, 'What is the (Adhvaryu's) response to the morning-prayer ?' The Adhvaryu should wait through (the prayer) waking, and when he blinks, this is his response. But let him not do this; if he fall asleep (again) he may as well sleep. When the Hotri brings his morning-prayer to a close ,--there is an offering-spoon called Prakaranî,--having therein taken ghee in four ladlings, he (the Adhvaryu) offers it.
9	3	12	For when the head of Yagña (the sacrifice) was struck off, his sap, running, entered the waters; that (sap) he fetched yesterday with the Vasatîvarî water; and he now goes for what sap of the sacrifice remains therein.
9	3	13	And when he offers that offering, he pours out (the ghee) towards that same sap of the sacrifice (in the water) and draws it to him. And, indeed, he pleases those deities to whom he offers that offering, and thus satisfied and pleased, they fit that sap of the sacrifice together  for him.
9	3	14	He offers with, 'May Agni, with his flame, hear my prayer;' whereby he means to say, 'May he hear this prayer of mine, may he vouchsafe it to me;'--'May the waters and the Soma-bowls hear, the divine!' whereby he means to say, 'May the waters hear this (prayer) of mine, may they vouchsafe it to me.'--'Hear me, ye stones,as knowing the sacrifice!' whereby he means to say, 'May the (pressing) stones hear this (prayer) of mine, may they vouchsafe it to me;' and 'as knowing the sacrifice,' he says, because the stones are indeed knowing . 'May the divine Savitri hear my prayer, Hail!' whereby he means to say, 'May the divine Savitri hear this (prayer) of mine, may he vouchsafe it to me;' for Savitri is the impeller of the gods; impelled by him he goes for that sap of the sacrifice.
9	3	15	Having then a second time taken ghee by four ladlings, he says, while going forth towards the north, 'Summon the waters!' whereby he means to say, 'Desire the waters, O Hotar!' The reason why the Hotri then recites  is this: by that[paragraph continues] (oblation) he (the Adhvaryu) pours out (the ghee) towards that sap of the sacrifice (in the water), and draws it to him; and he (the Hotri) then stands by those (Ekadhana pitchers) lest the evil spirits should injure them on the way.
9	3	16	He (the Adhvaryu) then gives directions, 'Come hither, cup-bearer of the Maitrâvaruna! Neshtar, lead up the wives! Ye bearers of the Ekadhana (cups), come hither! Agnîdh, step ever against the pit with the Vasatîvarî water and the Hotri's cup!' this is a composite direction.
9	3	17	They walk northwards out (of the sacrificial ground)--by the back of the pit and the front side of the Âgnîdhra; whereupon they proceed in the direction in which the water is. They go thither together with the wives. The reason why they go thither with the wives is this.
9	3	18	When the head of the sacrifice was struck off, its sap, running, entered the waters; those Gandharva Soma-wardens watched it.
9	3	19	The gods then said, 'Those Gandharvas, surely, are a great danger to us here, how can we carry off the sap of the sacrifice to a place free from danger and injury?'
9	3	20	They said, 'Well, the Gandharvas are fond of women; let us go together with the wives! The Gandharvas, surely, will hanker after the wives, and we shall carry off that sap of the sacrifice to a place free from danger and injury.'
9	3	21	They went with the wives; the Gandharvas did indeed hanker after the wives, and they (thegods) carried off that sap of the sacrifice to a place free from danger and injury.
9	3	22	And so does that (Adhvaryu) now go (to the water) with the wives; the Gandharvas hanker after the wives, and he carries off that sap of the sacrifice to a place free from danger and injury.
9	3	23	He offers (the ghee) upon the water; for that sap of the sacrifice, indeed, draws near to that oblation, when offered; it rises (to the surface) to meet it; and having thus brought it to light, he seizes it.
9	3	24	And again why he offers this oblation: he thereby pours out (ghee) towards that sap of the sacrifice, and draws it to him, and craves it of the waters. And, indeed, he pleases those deities to whom he offers that oblation, and thus satisfied and pleased they fit that sap of the sacrifice together for him.
9	3	25	He offers with , 'Ye divine waters,--the son of waters;' the waters are indeed divine, hence he says, 'Ye divine waters,--the son of waters;' 'That wave of yours, suitable for offering;' whereby he means to say, 'That wave of yours which is suitable for the sacrifice;' 'Mighty, most grateful;' by 'mighty' he means to say 'powerful,' and by 'most grateful' he means to say 'most sweet;' 'Give ye that unto those gods among the gods,' in saying this he has craved it of them; 'The drinkers of the pure (Soma);' the pure, doubtless, is the truth; in saying, 'the drinkers (pa) of the pure,' he means to say, 'the defenders (pa) of the truth;' 'Whose portion ye are, Hail!' for this indeed is their portion.
9	3	26	Thereupon he makes that oblation (ghee) float away by means of the Maitrâvaruna's cup, with , 'Thou art furrowing!' Evenas a coal is consumed by Fire, so is that oblation consumed by that deity. Now that water, which is in the Maitrâvaruna's cup, he will have to pour on the king (Soma); and ghee being a thunderbolt, and Soma seed, he makes (the ghee) float away lest he should injure that seed, Soma, by that thunderbolt, the ghee.
9	3	27	He then takes (water) with, 'I draw thee up for the imperishableness of the ocean;' for the ocean is water; he thus confers imperishableness upon the waters; wherefore, in spite of so much food (and drink) being consumed, the waters are not diminished. Thereupon they draw (water in) the Ekadhana pitchers, and thereupon the vessels for washing the feet .
9	3	28	The reason why he takes (water) with the Maitrâvaruna's cup is this. When the sacrifice escaped from the gods, the gods endeavoured to call it up by means of (sacrificial) calls (praisha) ; by means of the puroruk ('shining before') formulas  they pleased it (pra-rokaya), and by the nivids they made (their wishes) known (ni-vid) to it. Therefore he takes (water) with the Maitrâvaruna's cup.
9	3	29	They come back. The Agnîdh takes up his position opposite to the pit with the Vasatîvarî water and the Hotri's cup. Close over the pit he[paragraph continues] (the Adhvaryu) makes the Vasatîvarî water and the Maitrâvaruna's cup touch one another, with, 'Water hath united with water, plants with plants!' the sap of the sacrifice which was fetched yesterday and that fetched to-day, both kinds he thereby mixes together.
9	3	30	Now some indeed pour (some of) the Vasatîvarî water into the Maitrâvaruna's cup, and from the Maitrâvaruna's cup (back) to the Vasatîvarî water, arguing, 'Thereby we mix together both the sap of the sacrifice which was fetched yesterday and that fetched to-day.' But let him not do this; for when he pours (the water) together into the Âdhavanîya trough , then both kinds of sap are mixed together. Thereupon he pours the Vasatîvarî water into the Hotri's cup for the Nigrâbhyâs . And as to why he makes them touch one another close over the pit, it was from thence, forsooth, that the gods rose to heaven; he thus makes the sacrificer look along the road to heaven.
9	3	31	They return (to the Havirdhâna). The Hotri asks him, 'Adhvaryu, hast thou gained the waters?' whereby he means to say, 'Hast thou obtained the waters?' He replies to him, 'Yea, they have yielded themselves!' whereby he means to say, 'I have obtained them and they have yielded to me.'
9	3	32	And if it be an Agnishtoma, and there be left a residue (of ghee poured together) in the prakaranîspoon sufficient for an oblation, let him offer that. But if it be not sufficient for an oblation, he takes another portion of ghee in four ladlings and offers it, with , 'Whatever mortal thou favourest in battles, whomsoever thou speedest in the race, he winneth unfailing strength, Hail!' He offers with (a prayer) to Agni, because the Agnishtoma ('Agni's praise') means Agni; thus he establishes the Agnishtoma in Agni. [He offers] with (a verse) containing the word 'mortal,' because the Agnishtoma is of the same measure as man. Let hire then offer in this manner, if it be an Agnishtoma.
9	3	33	And if it be an Ukthya, let him touch the middle enclosing-stick,--there are three enclosing-sticks and three recitations (uktha) ; and by means of them the sacrifice is there established. And if it be either an Atirâtra or a Shodasin , let him neither make an oblation nor touch the middle enclosing-stick; having merely muttered (the above verse), let him silently betake himself (to the Havirdhâna) and enter it . In this way he duly distinguishes the forms of sacrifice from one another.
9	3	34	The Ekadhana pitchers are always of uneven number,--either three, or five, or seven, or nine, or eleven, or thirteen, or fifteen . Now two and two[paragraph continues] (an even number) means a productive pair; and the one that remains over, remains over for the sacrificer's prosperity. And, moreover, that which remains over for the sacrificer's prosperity is the common property (sa-dhana) of these (others); and because it is the common property of these, therefore they are called Ekadhana (having one as their common property).
9	4	1	Thereupon they sit down round the two press-boards . He (the Adhvaryu) then ties a piece of gold to that (nameless finger). For twofold, verily, is this; there is no third, namely, the truth and the untruth; the gods, forsooth, are the truth, and men are the untruth. And the gold has sprung from Agni's seed: 'With the truth I will touch the stalks, with the truth I will take hold of Soma,' thus he thinks, and therefore he ties a piece of gold to that (ring-finger).
9	4	2	He then takes a press-stone . Now thosepress-stones are of rock, and Soma is a god--for Soma was in the sky, Soma was Vritra; those mountains, those rocks are his body--he thus perfects him by means of his body, makes him whole; therefore they are of rock. Moreover, in pressing him they slay him, they slay him by means of that (stone, Soma's own body); thus he rises from thence, thus he lives; therefore the press-stones are of rock.
9	4	3	He takes it with , 'At the impulse of the divine Savitri I take thee with the arms of the Asvins, with the hands of Pûshan; thou art a giver!' For Savitri is the impeller of the gods; thus he takes it, impelled by Savitri. 'With the arms of the Asvins,' he says,--the Asvins are the Adhvaryus (of the gods): with their arms he thus takes it, not with his own. 'With the hands of Pûshan,' he says,--Pûshan is the distributor of portions: with his hands he thus takes it, not with his own. Moreover, that (stone) is a thunderbolt, and no man can hold it: by means of those deities he takes it.
9	4	4	'I take thee: thou art a giver,' he says; for when they press him by means of that (stone), then there is an oblation; and when he offers an oblation, then he gives sacrificial gifts,--thus, then, that (stone) gives twofold, oblations and sacrificial gifts; wherefore he says, 'Thou art a giver.'
9	4	5	'Perform thou this deep cult!' Cult means sacrifice; he thereby means to say, 'Perform thou this great sacrifice!'--'well-gotten for Indra;' by 'well-gotten' he means to say, 'well-produced;' and Indra is the deity of the sacrifice, wherefore he says, 'for Indra;'--'by the most excellent bolt,'for he, Soma, is indeed the most excellent bolt , therefore he says, 'by the most excellent bolt;'--'the (cult) rich in food and sweetness and drink,' whereby he means to say, 'the (cult) rich in sap.'
9	4	6	Thereupon he restrains-speech. For once on a time, the gods, while performing sacrifice, were afraid of an attack from the Asura-Rakshas. They said, 'Let us sacrifice in a low voice, let us restrain speech!' They sacrificed (with formulas muttered) in a low voice and restrained speech.
9	4	7	He then fetches the Nigrâbhyâs (waters), and makes him (the sacrificer) mutter over them , 'Ye are the Nigrâbhyâs, heard by the gods; satisfy me, satisfy my mind, satisfy my speech, satisfy my breath, satisfy mine eye, satisfy mine ear, satisfy my soul, satisfy mine offspring, satisfy my flocks, satisfy my followers, let not my followers thirst!' For water is sap, and over it he invokes this blessing, 'Satisfy ye my whole self, satisfy my offspring, satisfy my followers, let not my followers thirst!' Now that Upâmsusavana (stone), forsooth, is in reality Âditya Vivasvant (the sun), it is the pervading vital air (vyâna) of this (sacrifice).
9	4	8	Thereon he metes out (the Soma). For in pressing him they slay him, they slay him by means of that (stone); thus  he rises from hence, thus helives. And because he metes him out, therefore there is a measure,--both the measure among men , and what other measure there is.
9	4	9	He metes out with , 'Thee for Indra, with the Vasus, with the Rudras!' For Indra is the deity of the sacrifice: therefore he says, 'Thee for Indra;' and by saying 'with the Vasus, with the Rudras,' he assigns a share, along with (or after) Indra, to the Vasus and the Rudras.--'Thee for Indra, with the Âdityas!' whereby he assigns a share to the Âdityas along with Indra.--'Thee for Indra, the slayer of foes!' a foe is an enemy: 'Thee for Indra, the slayer of enemies,' he means to say. This is his (Indra's) special share: as there is a special share for a chief, so is this his special share apart from the (other) gods.
9	4	10	'Thee for the Soma-bearing falcon!' this he metes out for Gâyatrî.--'Thee for Agni, the bestower of growth of wealth!' Now Agni is Gâyatrî: he metes this out for Gâyatrî. And since Gâyatrî, as a falcon, fetched Soma from heaven, therefore she is (called) the Soma-bearing falcon: for that prowess of hers he metes out (for her) a second portion.
9	4	11	Now as to why he metes out five times ,--the sacrifice is of the same measure as the year, and there are five seasons in the year: he takes possession of it in five (divisions); hence he metes out five times.
9	4	12	He touches it with , 'What light of thine there is in the heavens, O Soma, what on earth, and what in the wide air, therewith make wide room for this sacrificer, for his prosperity: speak thou for the giver!' Now when he (Soma) first became sacrificial food for the gods, he thought within himself, 'I must not become sacrificial food for the gods with my whole self!' Accordingly he deposited those three bodies of his in these worlds.
9	4	13	The gods then were victorious. They obtained those bodies by means of this same (formula), and he became entirely the sacrificial food of the gods. And in like manner does this (priest) now thereby obtain those bodies of his, and he (Soma) becomes entirely the food of the gods: this is why he thus touches it.
9	4	14	He then pours Nigrâbhyâ water on it. Now the waters, forsooth, slew Vritra and by virtue of that prowess of theirs they now flow. Wherefore nothing whatsoever can check them when they flow; for they followed their own free will, thinking, 'To whom, forsooth, should we submit (or stop), we by whom Vritra was slain!' Now all this (universe), whatsoever there is, had submitted  to Indra, even he that blows yonder.
9	4	15	Indra spake, 'Verily, all this (universe), whatsoever there is, has submitted unto me: submit ye also to me!'--They said, 'What shall be our (reward) then?'--'The first draught of king Soma shall be yours!'--'So be it!' thus they submitted tohim; and they having submitted, he drew (ni-grabh) them to his breast; and because he thus drew them to his breast, therefore they are called Nigrâbhyâs. And in like manner does this sacrificer now draw them to his breast: and this is their first draught of king Soma, in that he pours Nigrâbhyâ water thereon.
9	4	16	He pours it with , 'Ye are grateful, the subduers of Vritra;'--the waters indeed are propitious: therefore he says, 'Ye are grateful;' and 'the subduers of Vritra' he says because they did slay Vritra;--'the beneficent wives of the immortal (Soma);' for the waters are immortal;--'Ye goddesses, lead this sacrifice to the gods!' there is nothing obscure in this; 'Invited, drink ye of Soma!' Thus invited they drink the first draught of king Soma.
9	4	17	Being about to beat (the Soma with the pressing-stone), let him think in his mind of him he hates: 'Herewith I strike N.N., not thee!' Now whosoever kills a human Brâhman here, he, forsooth, is deemed guilty ,--how much more so he who strikes him (Soma), for Soma is a god. But they do kill him when they press him;--they kill him with that (stone): thus he rises from thence, thus he lives; and thus no guilt is incurred.. But if he hate no one, he may even think of a straw, and thus no guilt is incurred.
9	4	18	He beats with , 'Fear not, tremble not!' whereby he means to say, 'Be not afraid, do not tremble, it is N.N. I strike, not thee!'--'Take thou strength!' whereby he means to say, 'Take sap!'--'Both ye bowls, that arefirm, remain firm, take strength!'--'Surely, it is those two (pressing-)boards that are thereby meant,' so say some;--what, then, if one were to break those two boards ? But, forsooth, it is these two, heaven and earth, that tremble for fear of that raised thunderbolt (the stone): hereby now he propitiates it for those two, heaven and earth; and thus propitiated it does not injure them. By 'Take strength!' he means to say, 'Take sap!'--'The evil is slain, not Soma!' he thereby slays every evil of his.
9	4	19	Thrice he presses , thrice he gathers together,four times he performs the Nigrâbha,--this makes ten, for of ten syllables consists the virâg, and Soma is of virâg nature: therefore he completes (the ceremony) in ten times.
9	4	20	Then as to why he performs the Nigrâbha. Now when he (Soma) first became sacrificial food for the gods, he set his heart on those (four) regions, thinking, 'Could I but consort with those regions as my mate, my loved resort!' By performing the Nigrâbha, the gods then made him consort with the regions as his mate, his loved resort; and in like manner does this (sacrificer) now, by performing the Nigrâbha, make him (Soma) consort with those regions as his mate, his loved resort.
9	4	21	He performs with , 'From east, from west, from north, from south--from every side may the regions resort to thee!' whereby he makes him consort with the regions as his mate, his loved resort. 'O mother, satisfy (him)! may the noble meet together !' A mother[paragraph continues] (ambâ) is a woman, and the regions (dis, fem.) are women: therefore he says, 'O mother, satisfy (him)!--May the noble meet together!' The noble doubtless means people (creatures, offspring): he thus means to say, 'May the people live in harmony with each other!' Even the people that are far away (from each other) live in harmony with each other: therefore he says, 'May the noble meet together.'
9	4	22	Now as to why he is called Soma. When he first became sacrificial food for the gods, he thought within him, 'I must not become, sacrificial food for the gods with my whole self!' That form of his which was most pleasing he accordingly put aside. Thereupon the gods were victorious; they said, 'Draw that unto thee, for therewith shalt thou become our food!' He drew it to him even from afar, saying, verily, that is mine own (svâ me): hence he was called Soma.
9	4	23	Then as to why he is called Yagña (sacrifice). Now, when they press him, they slay him; and when they spread him , they cause him to be born. He is born in being spread along, he is born moving (yan gâyate): hence yan-ga, for 'yañga' they say, is the same as 'yagña.'
9	4	24	Also this speech did he then utter , 'Verily thou, a god, shalt extol the mortal, O most mighty! than thee there is no other giver of joy , O lord! unto thee do I speak this word, O Indra!' For it was indeed as a mortal that he uttered this, 'Thou alone wilt produce (me) from here, no other but thee!'
9	4	25	And from the Nigrâbhyâ water they draw the several grahas (cups or libations of Soma). For it was the waters that slew Vritra, and in virtue of this prowess they flow; and it is from flowing water that he takes the Vasatîvarî water, and from the Vasatîvarî the Nigrâbhyâ water; and from the Nigrâbhyâ water the several grahas are drawn. In virtue of that prowess, then, the grahas are drawn from the Hotri's cup. Now the Hotri means the Rik (fem.), a woman; and from woman creatures are born here on earth: hence he makes him (Soma) to be born from that woman, the Rik, the Hotri; wherefore (he takes the grahas) from the Hotri's cup.
