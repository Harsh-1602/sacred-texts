1	1	1	The gods Agni, Indra, Soma, Makha, Vishnu, and the Visve Devâh, except the two Asvins, performed a sacrificial session .
1	1	2	Their place of divine worship was Kurukshetra.. Therefore people say that Kurukshetra is the gods’ place of divine worship: hence wherever in Kurukshetra one settles there one thinks, 'This is a place for divine worship;' for it was the gods’ place of divine worship.
1	1	3	They entered upon the session  thinking, 'May we attain excellence! may we become glorious! may we become eaters of food!' And in like manner do these (men) now enter upon the sacrificial session thinking, 'May we attain excellence! may we become glorious! may we become eaters of food!'
1	1	4	They spake, 'Whoever of us, through austerity, fervour, faith, sacrifice, and oblations, shall first compass the end of the sacrifice, he shall be the most excellent of us, and shall then be in common to us all.' 'So be it,' they said.
1	1	5	Vishnu first attained it, and he became themost excellent of the gods; whence people say, 'Vishnu is the most excellent of the gods.'
1	1	6	Now he who is this Vishnu is the sacrifice; and he who is this sacrifice is yonder Âditya (the sun). But, indeed, Vishnu was unable to control that (love of) glory of his; and so even now not every one can control that (love of) glory of his.
1	1	7	Taking his bow, together with three arrows, he stepped forth. He stood, resting his head on the end of the bow. Not daring to attack him, the gods sat themselves down all around him.
1	1	8	Then the ants said--these ants (vamrî), doubtless, were that (kind called) 'upadîkâ '--'What would ye give to him who should gnaw the bowstring?'--'We would give him the (constant) enjoyment of food, and he would find water even in the desert: so we would give him every enjoyment of food.'--'So be it,' they said.
1	1	9	Having gone nigh unto him, they gnawed his bowstring. When it was cut, the ends of the bow, springing asunder, cut off Vishnu's head.
1	1	10	It fell with (the sound) 'ghriṅ'; and on falling it became yonder sun. And the rest (of the body) lay stretched out (with the top part) towards the east. And inasmuch as it fell with (the sound) 'ghriṅ,' therefrom the Gharma  (was called); and inasmuch as he was stretched out (pra-vrig,), therefrom the Pravargya (took its name).
1	1	11	The gods spake, 'Verily, our great hero (mahân virah) has fallen:' therefrom the Mahâvîra pot (was named). And the vital sap which flowed from him they wiped up (sam-mrig) with their hands, whence the Samrâg .
1	1	12	The gods rushed forward to him, even as those eager to secure some gain (will do) . Indra reached him first. He applied himself to him limb after limb, and encompassed him , and, in encompassing him, he became (possessed of) that glory of his. And, verily, he who knows this becomes (possessed of) that glory which Indra is (possessed of).
1	1	13	And Makha (sacrifice), indeed, is the same as Vishnu: hence Indra became Makhavat (possessed of makha), since Makhavat is he who is mystically called Maghavat , for the gods love the mystic.
1	1	14	They gave to those ants the enjoyment of food; but, indeed, all food is water, for it is by moistening (the food) therewith that one eats here whatever one does eat.
1	1	15	This Vishnu, the (Soma-) sacrifice, they then divided amongst themselves into three parts: the Vasus (received) the morning-pressing, the Rudras the midday-pressing, and the Âdityas the third pressing.
1	1	16	Agni (received) the morning-pressing, Indrathe midday-pressing, and the Visve Devâh the third pressing.
1	1	17	The Gâyatrî (received) the morning-pressing, the Trishtubh the midday-pressing, and the Gagatî the third pressing. The gods went on worshipping and toiling with that headless sacrifice.
1	1	18	Now Dadhyañk Âtharvana knew this pure essence , this Sacrifice,--how this head of the Sacrifice is put on again, how this Sacrifice becomes complete.
1	1	19	He then was spoken to by Indra saying, 'If thou teachest this (sacrificial mystery) to any one else, I shall cut off thy head.'
1	1	20	Now this was heard by the Asvins,--'Verily, Dadhyañk Âtharvana knows this pure essence, this Sacrifice,--how this head of the Sacrifice is put on again, how this Sacrifice becomes complete.'
1	1	21	They went up to him and said, 'We two will become thy pupils.'--'What are ye wishing to learn?' he asked.--'This pure essence, this Sacrifice,--how this head of the Sacrifice is put on again, how this Sacrifice becomes complete,' they replied.
1	1	22	He said, 'I was spoken to by Indra saying, ‘If thou teachest this to any one else, I shall cut off thy head;’ therefore I am afraid lest he should indeed cut off my head: I cannot take you as my pupils.'
1	1	23	They said, 'We two shall protect thee from him.'--'How will ye protect me?' he replied.--They said, 'When thou wilt have received us as thypupils, we shall cut off thy head and put it aside elsewhere; then we shall fetch the head of a horse, and put it on thee: therewith thou wilt teach us; and when thou wilt have taught us, then Indra will cut off that head of thine; and we shall fetch thine own head, and put it on thee again.'--'So be it,' he replied.
1	1	24	He then received them (as his pupils); and when he had received them, they cut off his head, and put it aside elsewhere; and having fetched the head of a horse, they put it on him: therewith he taught them; and when he had taught them, Indra cut off that head of his; and having fetched his own head, they put it on him again,
1	1	25	Therefore it is concerning this that the Rishi has said , 'That Dadhyañk Âtharvana, with a horse's head, anywise spoke forth unto you two the sweet doctrine:'--'Unrestrainedly he spoke this,' is what is thereby meant.
1	1	26	One must not teach this to any and every one, since that would be sinful, and lest Indra should cut off his head; but one may only teach it to one who is known to him, and who has studied sacred writ, and who may be dear to him, but not to any and every one.
1	1	27	He may teach it to one dwelling with him (as a pupil) for a year; for the year is he that shines yonder, and the Pravargya also is that (sun): it is him he thereby gratifies, and therefore he may teach it to one dwelling with him for a year.
1	1	28	For three nights he keeps the rule (of abstinence); for there are three seasons in the year, and the year is he that shines yonder, and the Pravargya also is that one: it is him he therebygratifies, and therefore he keeps the rule for three nights.
1	1	29	Hot  (water) he sips, thinking, 'I will teach it as one practising austerities.' He teaches it whilst abstaining from flesh-food, thinking, 'I will teach it as one practising austerities;'
1	1	30	And whilst not drinking out of earthen (vessels); for whatever untruth (man) speaks on this (earth) is, as it were, immixed with her: therefore (one should do so) whilst not drinking out of earthen (vessels);
1	1	31	And whilst not coming into contact with Sûdras and remains of food; for this Gharma is he that shines yonder, and he is excellence, truth, and light; but woman, the Sûdra, the dog, and the black bird (the crow), are untruth: he should not look at these, lest he should mingle excellence and sin, light and darkness, truth and untruth.
1	1	32	And, verily, he that shines yonder is glory; and as to that glory, Âditya (the sun), that glory is just the sacrifice; and as to that glory, the sacrifice, that glory is just the Sacrificer; and as to that glory, the Sacrificer, that glory is just the officiating priests; and as to that glory, the officiating priests, that glory is just the sacrificial gifts: hence, if they bring up to him a dakshinâ he must not, at least on the same day, make over these (objects) to any one else lest he should make over to some one else that glory which has come to him; but rather on the morrow, or the day after: he thus gives it away after having made that glory his own, whatever it be--gold, a cow, a garment, or a horse.
1	1	33	And, verily, he who either teaches or partakes of this (Pravargya), enters that life, and that light. The observance of the rule thereof (is as follows). Let him not cover himself (with a garment) whilst the sun shines, lest he should be concealed from that (sun). Let him not spit whilst the sun shines, lest he should spit upon him. Let him not discharge urine whilst the sun shines, lest he discharge it upon him. For so long as he shines, so great he (the sun) is: thinking, 'Lest I should injure him by these (acts),' let him take food at night, after striking a light, whereby it is made to be a form of him who shines yonder. But on this point Âsuri used to say,--One rule the gods indeed keep, to wit, the truth: let him therefore speak nothing but the truth.
1	2	1	He equips (the Mahâvîra) with its equipments;--inasmuch as he equips it therewith from this and that quarter, that is the equipping nature of the equipments  (sambhâra): wheresoever anything of the sacrifice is inherent, therewith he equips it .
1	2	2	He gets ready a black antelope-skin,--for the black antelope-skin is the sacrifice : it is at thesacrifice he thus prepares (the pot);--with its hairy side (upwards),--for the hairs are the metres: on the metres he thus prepares it;--(spread out) on the left (north) side ,--for the north is the quarter of men;--on (the skin) with its neck-part to the east , for that (tends) towards the gods.
1	2	3	With a spade (he digs out the clay), for the spade is a thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt is vigour: with vigour he thus supplies and completes it (the Pravargya).
1	2	4	It is made of Udumbara (Ficus glomerata) wood, for the Udumbara is strength : with strength, with vital sap, he thus supplies and completes it.
1	2	5	Or of Vikaṅkata (Flacourtia sapida) wood; for when Pragâpati performed his first offering, a Vikaṅkata tree sprang forth from that place where, after offering, he cleansed (his hands); now an offering is a sacrifice, and (consequently) the Vikaṅkata isthe sacrifice: with the sacrifice he thus supplies and completes it.
1	2	6	It is a cubit long, for a cubit means the (fore-) arm, and with the arm strength is exerted: it (the spade) thus is composed of strength, and with strength he thus supplies and completes it.
1	2	7	He takes it up, with , 'At the impulse of the god Savitri, I take thee by the arms of the Asvins, by the hands of Pûshan: thou art a woman;'--the import (of this formula) is the same as before .
1	2	8	Having placed it in his left hand, he touches it with the right, and mutters , 'They harness the mind, and they harness the thoughts, the priests of the priest, of the great inspirer of devotion; the knower of the rites alone hath assigned the priestly offices: great is the praise of the god Savitri;'--the import of this is the same as before .
1	2	9	He then takes the lump of clay with the (right) hand and spade on the right (south) side, and with the (left) hand alone on the left (north) side , with , 'O divine Heaven and Earth,'--for when the sacrifice had its head cut off, its sap flowed away, and entered the sky and the earth: what clay (firm matter) there was that is this (earth), and what water there was that is yonder (sky); hence it is of clay and water that the Mahâvîra (vessels) are made: he thus supplies andcompletes it (the Pravargya) with that sap; wherefore he says, 'O divine Heaven and Earth,'--'May I this day compass for you Makha's head,'--Makha being the sacrifice, he thus says, 'May I this day accomplish for you  the head of the sacrifice;'--'on the Earth's place of divine worship,'--for on a place of divine worship of the earth he prepares it;--'for Makha thee! for Makha's head thee!'--Makha being the sacrifice, he thus says, 'For the sacrifice (I consecrate) thee, for the head of the sacrifice (I consecrate) thee.'
1	2	10	Then an ant-hill  (he takes, and puts on the skin), with , 'Ye divine ants,'--for it was they that produced this: just in accordance with the way in which the head of the sacrifice was there cut off, he now supplies and completes it with those (ants);--'the firstborn of the world,'--the firstborn of the world, doubtless, is this earth : it thus is therewith thathe supplies and completes it;--'may I this day compass for you Makha's head on the Earth's place of divine worship:--for Makha thee! for Makha's head thee!'--the import of this is the same as before.
1	2	11	Then (earth) torn up by a boar (he takes), with , 'Only thus large was she in the beginning,'--for, indeed, only so large was this earth in the beginning, of the size of a span. A boar, called Emûsha, raised her up, and he was her lord Pragâpati: with that mate, his heart's delight, he thus supplies and completes him ;--'may I this day compass for you Makha's head on the Earth's place of divine worship: for Makha thee! for Makha's head thee!' the import of this is the same as before.
1	2	12	Then Âdâra  (-plants), with , 'Indra's might ye are,'--for when Indra encompassed him (Vishnu) with might, then the vital sap of him, thus encompassed, flowed away; and he lay there stinking, as it were. He said, 'Verily, after bursting open (â-dar), as it were, this vital sap has sung praises:' thence Âdâra (-plants originated); and because he lay there stinking (pûy), as it were, therefore (they are also called) Pûtîka; and hence, when placed on the fireas an offering, they blaze; and hence also they are fragrant, for they originated from the vital sap of the sacrifice. And inasmuch as Indra, on that occasion, encompassed him with might, therefore he says, 'Indra's might ye are;'--'may I this day compass for you Makha's head on the Earth's place of divine worship: for Makha thee! for Makha's head thee!' the import of this is the same as before.
1	2	13	Then goat's milk;---for when the sacrifice had its head cut off, its heat went out of it, wherefrom the goat was produced: it is with that heat  that he thereby supplies and completes it;--with, 'For Makha thee! for Makha's head thee!' the import of this is the same as before.
1	2	14	These, then, are the five equipments with which he equips (the Pravargya),--fivefold is the sacrifice, and fivefold the victims, and five seasons are in the year, and the year is he that shines yonder, and the Pravargya also is that (sun): it is him he thus gratifies. These (objects), thus brought together, he touches with, 'For Makha (I consecrate) thee! for Makha's head thee!' the import of this is the same as before.
1	2	15	Now there is an enclosed space  on the northside: whilst proceeding towards that (shed) they mutter , 'May Brahmanaspati go forward!'--Brahmanaspati (the lord of devotion) doubtless is he that shines yonder, and the Pravargya also is that one: it is him he thus gratifies; hence he says, 'May Brahmanaspati go forward;'--'may the goddess Gladness go forward!'--for the goddess Gladness she (Vâk ) is;--'unto the hero , kindly to men and the dispenser of fivefold (offerings),'--he thereby praises and magnifies it (the Pravargya),--'unto the sacrifice may the gods lead us!'--he thereby makes all the gods its guardians.
1	2	16	It is an enclosed space;--for at that time the gods were afraid, thinking, 'We hope that the fiends, the Rakshas, will not injure here this our (Pravargya):' they accordingly enclosed for it this stronghold, and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now enclose for it this stronghold.
1	2	17	He then deposits (the sambhâras ) on the mound with, 'For Makha thee! for Makha's head thee!' the import of this is the same as before. He then takes a lump of clay and makes the Mahâvîra (pot) with, 'For Makha thee! for Makha's head thee,'--the import of this isthe same as before;--a span high , for the head is, as it were, a span high;--contracted in the middle , for the head is, as it were, contracted in the middle. At the top he then draws it out (so as to form) a spout  of three thumbs’ breadths (high): he thereby makes a nose to this (Mahâvîra, or Pravargya). When it is complete, he touches it with , 'Makha's head thou art,'--for it indeed is the head of Makha Saumya (the Soma-sacrifice). In the same way (he makes) the other two (Mahâvîra pots ); silently two milking-bowls (pinvana ), and silently two Rauhina-plates .
1	2	18	Verily this sacrifice is Pragâpati, and Pragâpatiis both of this, defined and undefined, limited and unlimited . Whatever one does with a Yagus formula, by that one makes up that form of him (Pragâpati) which is defined and limited; and whatever one does silently, by that one makes up that form of him which is undefined and unlimited: verily, then, whosoever, knowing this, does it on this wise, makes up that whole and complete Pragâpati. But he also leaves over a lump of spare (clay) for expiations.
1	2	19	He then smooths  it by means of Gavedhukâ grass (Coix barbata),--for when the sacrifice had its head cut off, its vital sap flowed away, and therefrom those plants grew up: with that vital sap he thus supplies and completes it;--with, 'For Makha thee! for Makha's head thee!' the import of this is the same as before, In the same way the other two (Mahâvîra pots); silently the two milking-bowls, silently the two Rauhina-plates.
1	2	20	He then fumigates these (vessels) with , 'With dung of the stallion, the impregnator, I fumigate thee,'--for thestallion is an impregnator, and the impregnator means vigour: with vigour he thus supplies and completes it,--'on the Earth's place of divine worship: for Makha thee, for Makha's head thee!' the import of this is the same as before. In the same way (he fumigates) the other two (Mahâvîra pots); silently the two milking-bowls, and silently the two Rauhina-plates.
1	2	21	He then bakes them, for what is baked belongs to the gods. He bakes them by means of bricks, for they it was that did so on that occasion : just in accordance with the way in which the head of the sacrifice was there cut off, he now supplies and completes it with those (bricks), But, indeed, let him bake them with anything  whereby they may become properly baked. Having laid down the fuel for baking , he puts down the Mahâvîra (pot), with, 'For Makha thee, for Makha's head thee!' the import of this is the same as before. In the same way the other two Mahâvîra (pots); silently the two milking-bowls, silently the two Rauhina-plates. By day he should bury them (in the hole), and by day he should take them out, for the day belongs to the gods.
1	2	22	He takes out (the first pot) with , 'For the righteous one (I take) thee,'--the righteous one, doubtless, is yonder world, for the righteous one means truth; and he that shines yonder is the truth, and the first Pravargya is that (god): it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore he says, 'For the righteous one (I take) thee.'
1	2	23	With, 'For the efficient one thee' (he takes out the second pot),--the efficient one (sâdhu), doubtless, is he (Vâyu, the wind) that purifies here by blowing, for as a permanent one (siddha) he blows through these worlds; and the second Pravargya is that (god): it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore he says, 'For the efficient one (I take) thee.'
1	2	24	With, 'For a good abode thee!' (he takes out the third pot),--the good abode, doubtless, is this (terrestrial) world, for it is in this world that all creatures abide; and the good abode also is Agni (fire), for Agni abides with all creatures  in this world; and the third Pravargya is that (god): it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore he says, 'For a good abode thee.' Silently (he takes out) the two milking-bowls, and silently the two Rauhina-plates.
1	2	25	He then pours goat's milk upon them  (thefirst) with, 'For Makha thee! for Makha's head thee!' the import of this is the same as before. In the same way the other two; silently the two milking-bowls, and silently the two Rauhina-plates.
1	2	26	And, verily, whosoever either teaches, or partakes of, this (Pravargya) enters that life, and that light: the observance of the rule thereof is the same as at the creation .
1	3	1	Now at the time when he there  proceeds with the guest-meal, he who intends to perform the Pravargya, prior to the Upasads , spreads Kusa grass with its tops directed towards the east, in front of the Gârhapatya, and places the vessels thereon in pairs ,--the Upayamanî (tray) and the Mahâvîra (pot), the pair of lifting-sticks , thetwo milking-bowls, the two Rauhina-plates, the two offering spoons for the Rauhina (cakes), and whatever other (implement) there is,--these make ten, for the Virâg consists of ten syllables, and the sacrifice is Virâg: he thus makes this to be equal to the Virâg, the sacrifice. And as to their being in pairs,--a pair means strength, for when two take hold of each other they exert strength; and a pair (couple) means a productive union: with a productive union he thus supplies and completes it.
1	3	2	Then the Adhvaryu takes the (lustral) sprinkling water, and, stepping up, says, 'Brahman, we shall proceed: Hotri, sing praises!' for the Brahman is seated on the right (south) side as the guardian of the sacrifice: to him he thus says, 'Sit thou undistracted: we are about to restore the head of the Sacrifice;' and 'Hotri, sing praises!' he says, because the Hotri is the sacrifice: he thus thereby says to him, 'Restore the head of the sacrifice!' and accordingly the Hotri begins to recite--
1	3	3	‘The Brahman, firstborn from afore ,--the Brahman, doubtless, is yondersun, and he is born day by day from afore (in the east); and the Pravargya also is that (sun): it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore he says, 'The Brahman (n.), firstborn from afore.' He then sprinkles (the vessels): the import of this is the same as before .
1	3	4	He sprinkles (the chief Mahâvîra) with , 'For Yama thee!'--Yama, doubtless, is he who shines yonder, for it is he who controls (yam) everything here, and by him everything here is controlled; and the Pravargya also is that (sun): it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore he says, 'For Yama (I sprinkle) thee.'
1	3	5	'For Makha thee!'--Makha, doubtless, is he who shines yonder, and the Pravargya also is that one: it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore he says, 'For Makha thee.'
1	3	6	'For Sûrya's heat thee!'--Sûrya, doubtless, is he who shines yonder, and the Pravargya also is that one: it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore he says, 'For Sûrya's heat thee.'
1	3	7	Having taken out a post  by the front door (of the sâlâ), he drives it into the ground on the south side (of the sâlâ ), so that the Hotri, whilst singing praises, may look upon it; for the Hotri is the sacrifice, and he thereby restores the sacrifice to this (earth), and she causes the Gharma (milk) to rise.
1	3	8	Having turned round the Emperor's throne-seat  in front of the Âhavanîya, he places it south thereof, and north of the King's (Soma's) throne-seat , so as to face the east.
1	3	9	It is made of Udumbara wood, for the Udumbara means strength: with strength, with vital sap, he thus supplies and completes it (the Pravargya).
1	3	10	It is shoulder-high, for on the shoulders this head is set: he thus sets the head upon the shoulders.
1	3	11	It is wound all over with cords  of Balvaga grass (Eleusine indica). When the sacrifice had its head cut off, its vital sap flowed out, and thence these plants grew up: with that life-sap he thus supplies and completes it.
1	3	12	And as to why he places it north (of Soma's seat),--Soma is the sacrifice, and the Pravargya is its head; but the head is higher (uttara): therefore he places it north (uttara) of it. Moreover, Soma is king, and the Pravargya is emperor, and the imperial dignity is higher than the royal: therefore he places it north of it .
1	3	13	And when the Hotri recites this , 'Whom the priests anoint, as if spreading him . . .,' he anoints that Mahâvîra which is to be used, all over with ghee , with, 'May the god Savitri anoint thee with honey!' for Savitri is the impeller of the gods, and honey means everything whatever there is here: he thus anoints it (or him) all over with everything here, and Savitri, as the impeller, impels it for him,--this is why he says, 'May the god Savitri anoint thee with honey!'
1	3	14	Now sand has been strewed  on the north side of it: below that he (previously) throws (a plate of) white gold , with, 'Protect it from contact with the earth!' For at that time the gods were afraid lest the Rakshas, the fiends, might injure that (Pravargya) of theirs from below; and that, to wit, gold, being Agni's seed, it (serves) for repelling the fiends, the Rakshas. But, indeed, the Earth also was afraid of this lest this (Pravargya), when heated and glowing , might injureher: he thus keeps it separate from her. White it is, for white, as it were , is this earth.
1	3	15	And when the Hotri recites this , 'Sit thee down: thou art great . . .,' sheaths of reed-grass are kindled on both sides , and throwing them (on the mound), he puts (the Mahâvîra pot) thereon. When the sacrifice had its head cut off, its life-sap flowed away, and therefrom these plants grew up: with that life-sap he thus supplies and completes it.
1	3	16	And as to why they are kindled on both sides: he thereby repels the Rakshas, the fiends, from all the quarters. Whilst this (pot) is being heated, the (Sacrificer's) wife covers her head, thinking, 'Lest this one, when heated and glowing, should rob me of my eyesight,' for it indeed becomes heated and glowing.
1	3	17	He puts it on with, 'Flame thou art, glow thou art, heat thou art;'--for the Gharma is he who shines yonder, and he indeed is all that: it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore he says, 'Flame thou art, glow thou art, heat thou art.'
1	3	18	He (the Sacrificer) then invokes blessings on this (earth) , for the sacrifice is this (earth): it is thus (whilst being) on her that he invokes blessings, and she fulfils them all for him.
1	3	19	'Unmolested thou art in front (in the east),'--for unmolested by the Rakshas, the fiends, indeed, this (earth) is in front;--'in Agni's over-lordship,'--he thus makes Agni her over-lord for the warding off of the fiends, the Rakshas;--'grant thou life unto me!'--he thus secures life for himself, and accordingly he attains the full (term of) life.
1	3	20	'Possessed of sons towards the south,'--in this there is nothing hidden, so to speak;--'in Indra's over-lordship,'--he thus makes Indra her over-lord for the warding off of the fiends, the Rakshas;--'grant thou offspring unto me!'--he thus secures offspring and cattle for himself, and accordingly he becomes possessed of sons and of cattle.
1	3	21	'Well to live on behind (towards the western region),'--in this there is nothing hidden, so to speak;--'in god Savitri's over-lordship;'--the god Savitri he thus makes her over-lord for the warding off of the fiends, the Rakshas;--'grant thou eyesight unto me!'--he thus secures eyesight for himself, and accordingly he becomes possessed of eyesight.
1	3	22	'A sphere of hearing towards the north,'--'causing (sacrificial calls) to be heard ,' is what he thereby means to say;--'in the creator's over-lordship,'--the creator he thusmakes her over-lord for the warding off of the fiends, the Rakshas; 'grant thou prosperity (increase) of wealth unto me!'--wealth, prosperity, he thus secures for himself, and accordingly he becomes wealthy and prosperous.
1	3	23	'Disposition above,'--'disposing  above' is what he thereby means to say;--'in Brihaspati's over-lordship,'--Brihaspati he thus makes her over-lord for the warding off of the fiends, the Rakshas;--'grant me vigour!'--vigour he thereby secures to himself, and accordingly he becomes vigorous, strong.
1	3	24	On the right (south) side (of the Mahâvîra) he (the Sacrificer) then makes amends by (laying down) the hand with the palm upwards, with, 'Shield me from all evil spirits!' whereby he means to say, 'Protect me from all troubles!' When the sacrifice had its head cut off, its life-sap flowed away, and went to the Fathers, but the Fathers are three in number : it is with these that he thus supplies and completes it (the Pravargya).
1	3	25	Thereupon, whilst touching her (the earth) , 'Thou art Manu's mare,' for, having become a mare, she (the earth) indeed carried Manu, and he is her lord, Pragâpati: with that mate, his heart's delight, he thus supplies and completes him (Pragâpati, the Pravargya, and Sacrificer).
1	3	26	He then lays pieces of (split) Vikaṅkata wood round (the Mahâvîra), two pointing to the east , with , 'Hail! be thou encompassed by the Maruts!'--the call of 'hail!' he places first, and the deity last ; for the call of 'hail!' is he who shines yonder, and the Pravargya also is that (sun): it is him he thus gratifies; and hence he places the call of 'hail!' first, and the deity last.
1	3	27	'Be thou encompassed by the Maruts,' he says; for the Maruts are the (common) people: he thus surrounds the nobility by the people, whence the nobility here is surrounded on both sides by the people. Silently (he lays down) two pointing to the north , silently (again) two pointing to the east, silently two pointing to the north, silently two pointing to the east.
1	3	28	He makes them to amount to thirteen, for there are thirteen months in the year, and theyear is he who shines yonder, and the Pravargya also is that (sun): it is him he thus gratifies, and hence he makes them to amount to thirteen.
1	3	29	He then places a gold plate (weighing a hundred grains) on the top (of the pot), with, 'Protect it from contact with the sky!' For at that time the gods were afraid lest the Rakshas, the fiends, might injure that (Pravargya) of theirs from above; and that--to wit, gold--being Agni's seed, it (serves) for repelling the fiends, the Rakshas. But, indeed, the Sky also was afraid of this lest this (Pravargya), when heated and glowing, might injure it: he thus keeps it separate therefrom. It is yellow, for yellow, as it were, is the sky.
1	3	30	He (the Adhvaryu) then fans (the fire) thrice by means of (three) fans , whilst muttering, 'Honey!' each time; for honey means breath: he thus lays breath into it. Three (fans) there are, for there are three breathings, the out (and in)-breathing, the up-breathing and the through-breathing: it is these he thus lays into it.
1	3	31	They then fan it thrice  in the non-sunwise way. When the sacrifice had its head cut off, its life-sap flowed away, and went to the Fathers,--the Fathers being three in number : with them he thus supplies it.
1	3	32	But, indeed, the breathings depart from those who perform the fanning at the sacrifice. Theyfan again thrice in the sunwise way,--this makes six; and six in number are these breathings (vital airs) in the head: it is these he thus lays into it. They cook the two Rauhina (cakes). When a blaze is produced, he takes off the gold (plate).
1	3	33	And when the Hotri recites this , 'Successful, O Asvins, make ye our voice,' the Adhvaryu steps up, and says, 'The Gharma is aglow .' If it be aglow, he may know that the Sacrificer will become more prosperous; and if it be not aglow, he may know that he will become poorer; and if it be neither aglow nor the reverse, he may know that he (the Sacrificer) will become neither more prosperous nor poorer: but indeed (the pot) should be fanned so (long) as to be aglow.
1	3	34	And, verily, whosoever either teaches, or partakes of, this (Pravargya) enters that life, and that light: the observance thereof is the same as at the creation .
1	4	1	Now, when the Adhvaryu here steps up and says, 'The Gharma is aglow,' they step up and revere it (the Mahâvîra) with the Avakâsa ; but the 'avakâsa' are the vital airs: it is thus the vital airs he lays into it. Six of them  step up to it, for six in number are these vital airs in the head: it is these he thus lays into it.
1	4	2	'The child of the gods,'--the child (garbha) of the gods, in truth, is he that shines yonder, for he holds (grabh) everything here, and by him everything here is held; and the Pravargya also is that (sun): it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore he says, 'The child of the gods.'
1	4	3	'The father of thoughts,'--for he (the sun) is indeed the father of thoughts;--'the lord of creatures,'--for he is indeed the lord of creatures.
1	4	4	'The god hath united with the god Savitri,'--for the god (the Mahâvîra) has indeed united with the god Savitri (the sun);--'with Sûrya he shineth,'--for (equally) with Sûrya (the sun) he has indeed shone.
1	4	5	'Agni hath united with Agni,'--for Agni (fire) has indeed united with Agni;--'with the divine Savitri,'--for with the divine Savitri he has indeed united;--'with Sûryahe hath shone,'--for with Sûrya he has indeed shone.
1	4	6	'Hail! Agni hath united with his heat,'--for Agni has indeed united with his heat; the call of hail he places first, and the deity last: the significance of this is the same as before;--'with the divine Savitri,'--for with the divine Savitri he has indeed united;--'with Sûrya he hath shed light,'--for with Sûrya he has indeed shed light.
1	4	7	These, then, are three 'avakâsa,'--for there are three vital airs, the in (and out)-breathing, the up-breathing, and the through-breathing: it is thereby that he lays it (the vital air) into him.
1	4	8	'The sustainer of the sky, and of heat upon earth, shineth forth,'--for as the sustainer of the sky, and of heat on earth, that (sun, and Mahâvîra) indeed shines forth;--'the divine sustainer of the gods, he, the immortal, born of heat,'--for he is indeed the divine sustainer of the gods, the immortal one, born of heat;--'grant unto us speech, devoted to the gods!'--speech doubtless is worship: he thus means to say thereby, 'bestow upon us worship whereby we shall please the gods!'
1	4	9	'I beheld the guardian, the never-resting ,'--he who shines yonder is indeed the guardian, for he guards everything here; and he does not lie down to rest: therefore he says, 'I beheld the guardian, the never-resting;'--
1	4	10	, 'Wandering on paths hither and thither,'--for he indeed wanders hither and thither on the divine  paths;--'arraying himself in the gathering and the radiating,'--for he indeed arrays himself in the gathering (converging) and the radiating regions, or rays;--'he moveth to and fro within the spheres,'--for again and again he wanders moving within these worlds.
1	4	11	'O lord of all worlds, O lord of all thought, O lord of all speech, O lord of every speech!' that is, 'O lord of all this (universe);'--'Thou art heard by the gods, O god Gharma, as a god, guard thou the gods!' in this there is nothing hidden, so to speak.
1	4	12	'Give thy countenance hereafter to the divine feast of you two,'--it is with regard to the two Asvins that he says this, for it was the Asvins that then restored the head of the sacrifice: it is them he thus pleases, and therefore he says, 'Give thy countenance hereafter to the divine feast of you two.'
1	4	13	'Honey to the two lovers of honey! honey to the two longing for honey!'--for Dadhyañk the Âtharvana indeed told them (the Asvins) the Brâhmana called Madhu (honey), and this is their dear resource: it is by means of that (dear resource) of theirs that he approaches them, and therefore he says, 'Honey to the two lovers of honey! honey to the two longing for honey!'
1	4	14	'To the heart (I consecrate) thee, to the mind thee, to the sky thee, to the sun thee: going upwards take thou the sacrifice to the gods in heaven!' in this there is nothing hidden, so to speak.
1	4	15	'Thou art our father: be thou our father!'--for he who shines yonder is indeed the father, and the Pravargya is that (sun): it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore he says, 'Thou art our father: be thou our father!'--'Reverence be unto thee: injure me not!'--it is a blessing he thereby invokes.
1	4	16	Thereupon he uncovers the head of the (Sacrificer's) wife, and makes her say whilst she is looking at the Mahâvîra, 'Together with Tvashtri will we serve thee: (bestow thou sons and cattle upon me! bestow thou offspring upon us! may I remain unscathed together with my husband!)'--the Pravargya (m.) is a male, and the wife is a female: a productive pair is thus produced.
1	4	17	And, verily, whosoever either teaches, or partakes of, this (Pravargya) enters that life, and that light: the observance thereof is the same as at the creation .
2	1	1	He now offers (the first of) the two Rauhina (cakes) :--, 'May the daybe pleased with its brightness, the well-lighted with its light, hail!' with this text both (cakes are offered) in the morning;--'May the night be pleased with its brightness, the well-lighted with its light, hail!' with this text both (cakes are offered) in the evening.
2	1	2	And as to why he offers two Rauhina (cakes),--the two Rauhinas doubtless are Agni and Âditya (the sun), for by means of these two deities sacrificers ascend (ruh) to heaven.
2	1	3	And, indeed, the Rauhinas are also day and night, and the Pravargya is the sun: he thus encompasses yonder sun by the day and the night, whence he is encompassed by the day and the night.
2	1	4	And, indeed, the Rauhinas are also these twoworlds, and the Pravargya is the sun: he thus encompasses yonder sun by these two worlds, whence he is encompassed by these two worlds.
2	1	5	And, indeed, the Rauhinas are also the two eyes, and the Pravargya is the head: he thus places the eye in the head.
2	1	6	He now takes a rope, with , 'At the impulse of the divine Savitri, I take thee, with the arms of the Asvins, with the hands of Pûshan: Aditi's  zone thou art;'--the mystic import of this is the same as before .
2	1	7	He then calls the cow, whilst stepping behind the Gârhapatya , 'Idâ, come hither! Aditi, come hither! Sarasvatî, come hither!' for the cow is Idâ, and the cow is Aditi, and the cow is Sarasvatî. And he also calls her by her (real) name, with these (formulas), 'N.N. , come hither!' thus thrice.
2	1	8	When she comes, he lays (the rope) round her (horns), with , 'Aditi's zone thou art, Indrânî's head-band;'--for Indrânî is Indra's beloved wife, and she has a most variegated head-band: 'that thou art' he thereby means to say, and that he indeed thereby makes it to be.
2	1	9	He then lets the calf to it (to suck), with, 'Pûshan thou art,'--Pûshan, doubtless, is he that blows here (the wind), for that one supports  (push) all this (universe); and the Pravargya also is that (wind): it is him he thus pleases, and therefore he says, 'Pûshan thou art.'
2	1	10	He then leads it (the calf) away  with, 'Afford (milk) for the Gharma!' for the Gharma, doubtless, is that fluid which this (cow) lets flow: he thus means to say thereby, 'Allow her a share!'
2	1	11	He then causes it to flow into the milking-bowl, with , 'Flow for the Asvins!'--with regard to the Asvins he thus says this, for it was the Asvins who restored the head of the sacrifice: it is them he thus pleases, and therefore he says, 'Flow for the Asvins!'
2	1	12	, 'Flow for Sarasvatî!'--Sarasvatî, doubtless, is Speech, and with speech the Asvins then restored the head of the Sacrifice: it is those (Asvins) he thus pleases, and therefore he says, 'Flow for Sarasvatî!'
2	1	13	'Flow for Indra!'--for Indra is the deity of the sacrifice, and it was indeed by him who is the deity of the sacrifice that the Asvins then restored the head of the sacrifice: it is them he thus pleases, and therefore he says, 'Flow for Indra!'
2	1	14	The (spilt) drops he then consecrates with, 'Hail, possessed of Indra! hail, possessed of Indra!' for Indra is the deity of the sacrifice: he thus pleases him who is the deity of the sacrifice, and therefore he says, 'Hail, possessed of Indra! hail, possessed of Indra!' Thrice he says it, for threefold is the sacrifice. The call of 'hail!' he places first, and the deity last: the significance of this is the same as before.
2	1	15	He then touches her udder , with , 'This ever-flowing, grateful udder of thine,'--that is to say, 'This udder of thine placed in secret ;'--'treasure-giving, wealth-granting, bountiful,'--that is to say, 'which is a giver of treasures, a granter of wealth, and precious;'--'whereby thou furtherest all desirable things,'--that is to say, 'whereby thou supportest all the gods and all creatures;'--'O Sarasvatî, move that hither for us to suck,'--Sarasvatî, doubtless, is Speech, and so is this (cow) which yields the Gharma milk; and Speech is worship: thus he means to say, 'Grant us worship whereby we may please the gods.' He then steps up to the site of the Gârhapatya with, 'I pass along the wide aerial realm,'--the mystic import of this is the same as before .
2	1	16	He then takes the two lifting-sticks , with , 'The Gâyatrî metre thou art,--the Trishtubh metre thou art,'--he thus takes them with both the Gâyatrî and the Trishtubh metres;--'with heaven and earth I encompass thee,'--for the two lifting-sticks are indeed these two, heaven and earth; and the Pravargya is the sun: he thus encompasses yonder sun within these two, heaven and earth. Thereupon (having lifted up the pot) he sweeps it clean with a branch of reed grass: the mystic import of this is the same as before.
2	1	17	He then puts it on the 'supporting' tray  with, 'By the air I support thee,'--for the 'supporting' tray is the air, since everything here is supported by the air; and the 'supporting' tray also is the belly, for all food and drink here is supported (held) by the belly: therefore he says, 'By the air I support thee.'
2	1	18	He then pours in the goat's milk ; for that (Mahâvîra pot) when heated, becomes glowing: he thus soothes it, and when soothed he pours the cow's milk into it--
2	1	19	With, 'O Indra and ye Asvins!'--for Indra is the deity of the sacrifice, and he thus pleases him who is the deity of the sacrifice; and 'Ye Asvins' he says, because the Asvins at that time restored the head of the sacrifice, and it is them he thus pleases: therefore he says, 'O Indra and ye Asvins!'
2	1	20	'Of bees’ honey'--this is indeed honey;--'drink ye the Gharma (hot draught),'--that is to say, drink ye the liquor;'--'ye true ones,'--those (deities) are indeed true (vasu), for it isthey that maintain (vâsaya) all this (universe);--'worship ye, vât!' thus this comes to be for him as if it were offered with the Vashat-call.
2	1	21	'Hail to Sûrya's ray, the rain-winner !'--for one of the sun's rays is called 'rain-winner,' whereby he supports all these creatures: it is that one he thus pleases, and therefore he says, 'Hail to Sûrya's ray, the rain-winner!' The call of hail he places first, and the deity last: the significance of this is the same as before .
2	1	22	And, verily, whosoever either teaches, or partakes of, this (Pravargya) enters that life, and that light: the observance thereof is the same as at the creation .
2	2	1	And when the Hotri recites this (verse), 'Let Brahmanaspati go forward, let the goddess Sûnritâ go forward,'--the Adhvaryu, stepping forward, makes offering (by muttering) the wind-names. For at this time the gods were afraid lest the Rakshas, the fiends, might injure that (Pravargya) of theirs in the middle (of the sacrifice): they offered it with the Svâhâ-call before (its being taken to) the Âhavanîya, being thus offered they offered it (again) in the fire; and in like manner does this one now offer it with the Svâhâ-call before (its being taken to) the Âhavanîya, and being thus offered he offers it (again) in the fire.
2	2	2	'To the wind Ocean (I offer) thee, hail!'--the (aerial) ocean (samudra) indeed is he who blows here, for from out of that ocean all the gods and all the beings issue forth (samud-dru): it is to him (Vâyu, the wind) he thus offers it, and therefore he says, 'To the wind Ocean (I consecrate) thee, hail!'
2	2	3	'To the wind Flood--thee, hail!'--the flood (sarira) indeed is he who blows here, for from out of that flood all the gods and all the creatures come forth together (saha irate): it is to him he thus offers it, and therefore he says, 'To the wind Flood--thee, hail!'
2	2	4	'To the wind Unassailable--thee, hail! To the wind Irresistible--thee, hail!'--unassailable and irresistible indeed is he who blows here: it is to him he thus offers it, and therefore he says, 'To the wind Unassailable--thee, hail! To the wind Irresistible--thee, hail!'
2	2	5	'To the wind Favourable--thee, hail! To the wind Ogress-ridder--thee, hail!'--favourable and an ogress-ridder indeed is he who blows here: it is to him he thus offers it, and therefore he says, 'To the wind Favourable--thee, hail! To the wind Ogress-ridder--thee, hail!'
2	2	6	'To Indra, accompanied by the Vasus and Rudras, (I offer) thee, hail!'--Indra indeed is he who blows here: it is to him he thus offers it, and therefore he says, 'To Indra--thee;' and when he says, 'accompanied by the Vasus and Rudras,' thereby he allows a share to the Vasus and Rudras along with Indra; and,moreover, it is thereby made to be like the morning Soma-pressing, and the midday-pressing .
2	2	7	'To Indra, accompanied by the Âdityas,--thee, hail!'--Indra indeed is he who blows here: it is to him he thus offers it, and therefore he says, 'To Indra--thee;' and when he says, 'accompanied by the Âdityas,' thereby he allows a share to the Âdityas along with Indra; and, moreover, it is made like the evening-pressing .
2	2	8	'To Indra, the slayer of the evil-minded,--thee, hail!'--Indra indeed is he who blows here: it is to him he thus offers it, and therefore he says, 'To Indra--thee;' and as to his saying, 'to the slayer of the evil-minded,' the evil-minded one being an enemy, he thereby means to say, 'To Indra, the slayer of enemies,--thee!' This is his (Indra's) special share: even as there is a share for a chief , so is this his (share) apart from the (other) gods.
2	2	9	'To Savitri, accompanied by the Ribhus, the Vibhus (lords), and the Vâgas (powers),--thee, hail!'--Savitri (the sun) indeed is he who blows here: it is to him he thus offers it, and therefore he says, 'To Savitri, accompanied by the Ribhus, the Vibhus, and the Vâgas,--thee!' He thus allows a share therein to all the gods along (with Savitri).
2	2	10	'To Brihaspati, accompanied by the All-gods,--thee, hail!'--Brihaspati indeed is he who blows here: it is to him he thus offersit, and therefore he says, 'To Brihaspati--thee;' and when he says, 'accompanied by the All-gods,' he thereby allows a share therein to all the gods along (with Brihaspati).
2	2	11	'To Yama, accompanied by the Aṅgiras and the Fathers,--thee, hail!'--Yama indeed is he who blows here: it is to him he thus offers it, and therefore he says, 'To Yama--thee;' and as to his saying, 'accompanied by the Aṅgiras and the Fathers,'--when the sacrifice had its head cut off, its life-sap flowed away, and went to the Fathers,--the Fathers being three in number : thus it is to these he thereby allows a share along (with Yama).
2	2	12	These are twelve names,--twelve months are in a year, and the year is he that shines yonder, and the Pravargya also is that (sun): thus it is him he thereby pleases, and therefore there are twelve (names).
2	2	13	He then pours (the spilt milk and ghee) from the tray into the Mahâvîra (pot) with, 'Hail to the Gharma!'--the Gharma (hot draught) is he who shines yonder, and the Pravargya also is that (sun): thus it is him he thereby pleases, and therefore he says, 'Hail to the Gharma!'--the call of 'hail!' he places first, and the deity last: the significance of this is the same as before .
2	2	14	When it has been poured in, he mutters, 'Hail, the Gharma to the Fathers!' When the sacrifice had its head cut off, its life-sap flowedaway, and went to the Fathers--the Fathers being three in number: it is these he thus pleases. The call of 'hail!' he places first, and the deity last: the significance of this is the same as before.
2	2	15	He recites no anuvâkyâ (invitatory) formula, for once for all the Fathers have passed away: therefore he recites no anuvâkyâ. Having stepped across , and called (on the Âgnîdhra) for the Sraushat , he (the Adhvaryu) says (to the Hotri), 'Pronounce the offering-formula (yâgyâ) of the Gharma;' and on the Vashat-call being uttered he offers--
2	2	16	With , 'All regions (hath he worshipped), seated in the south,'--that is to say, 'every region (has he worshipped), seated on the south;'--'all gods hath he worshipped here,'--that is, 'every god has he worshipped here;'--'of the sweet Gharma, consecrated by Svâhâ (hail!), drink ye, O Asvins!'--with regard to the Asvins he says this; for the Asvins restored the head of the sacrifice: it is them he thus pleases. The call of 'hail!' he places first, and the deity last: the significance of this is the same as before.
2	2	17	And, having offered, he (thrice) shakes (the Mahâvîra) upwards, with , 'In heaven place thou this sacrifice! this sacrifice place thou in heaven!'--for the Gharma (hot milk-draught), the sacrifice, is yonder sun, and he indeed is 'placed' in the heavens, isestablished in the heavens: it is thus him he thereby pleases, and therefore he says, 'In heaven place thou this sacrifice! this sacrifice place thou in heaven!' On the repetition of the Vashat, he offers--
2	2	18	With, 'Hail to Agni, worthy of sacrifice!'--this is in lieu of the Svishtakrit (offering), for Agni is the maker of good offering;--'may blessing result from the sacrificial texts!' for by the sacrificial texts that (sun) is established (as the Mahâvîra) in this world: thus it is them he thereby pleases. The call of 'hail!' he places first, and the deity last: the significance of this is the same as before.
2	2	19	The Brahman (priest) pronounces the anumantrana (formula of consecration); for the Brahman is the best physician among the officiating priests: thus he heals this sacrifice by means of him who is the best physician among the priests.
2	2	20	'O Asvins, drink ye the Gharma!'--with regard to the Asvins he says this, for the Asvins restored the head of the sacrifice: it is them he thus pleases.
2	2	21	'The hearty  one with daily  favours,'--this is indistinct, for Pragâpati is indistinct (undefined), and the sacrifice is Pragâpati: Pragâpati, the sacrifice, he thus heals;--
2	2	22	'To the web-weaver,'--the web-weaver, doubtless, is he that shines yonder, for he moves along these worlds as if along a web; and the Pravargya also is that (sun): thus it is him he thereby pleases, and therefore he says, 'To the web-weaver'--
2	2	23	'To Heaven and Earth be reverence!' he thus propitiates heaven and earth, within which everything here is contained.
2	2	24	Thereupon the Sacrificer (mutters),--the Sacrificer being the sacrifice, he thus heals the sacrifice by means of the sacrifice;--
2	2	25	'The Asvins drank the Gharma,'--he says this with regard to the Asvins, for the Asvins restored the head of the sacrifice: it is them he thus pleases.
2	2	26	'Heaven and Earth have approved of it '--he says this with regard to heaven and earth, within which everything here is contained;--'may gifts accrue here!'--whereby he means to say, 'may there be riches for us here.'
2	2	27	The rising (milk) he then consecrates by the anumantrana , 'For freshness swell thou!' --whereby he means to say, 'For rain . . .;'--'for vigour swell thou!'--he thereby means the vigour, the life-sap, which results from the rain;--'for the Brahman swell thou!'---he thereby means the priesthood;--'for the Kshatra swell thou!'--he thereby means the nobility;--'for Heaven and Earth swell thou!'--he thereby means these two, the heaven and the earth, within which everything here is contained.
2	2	28	When it rises upwards; it rises for (the benefit of) the Sacrificer; when on the front side, it does so for the gods; when on the right (south) side, it does so for the Fathers; when at the back (west side), it does so for the cattle; when on the left (north) side, it does so for (the Sacrificer's) offspring: in any case no fault is incurred by the Sacrificer, for it always rises upwards; and in whatever direction it rises in that it rises. When the drops cease,--
2	2	29	He steps out towards the north-east with, 'A well-supporting support thou art,'--he who shines yonder is indeed a support, for he supports everything here, and by him everything here is supported; and the Pravargya also is that (sun): thus it is him he thereby, pleases, and therefore he says, 'A well-supporting support thou art.'
2	2	30	He then places (the Mahâvîra) on the mound with, 'Incapable of injuring, preserve thou our powers!'--'Not angry , preserve our wealth,'is what he thereby means to say;--'preserve the priesthood, preserve the nobility, preserve the people!'--'preserve all that,' is what he thereby means to say.
2	2	31	He then offers by means of the pieces of (split) wood ,--the pieces of wood being the vital airs, it is the vital airs he thus bestows upon him;--
2	2	32	With , 'Hail to Pûshan, to the cream!'--Pûshan, doubtless, is he who blows here, for he (the wind) supports (push) everything here; and the breath also is that (wind): it is breath he thus bestows upon him, whence he says, 'Hail to Pûshan, to the cream!' The call of 'hail!' he places first, and the deity last: the significance of this is the same as before. Having offered (by means of the first piece) he leans it against the middle enclosing-stick  (paridhi).
2	2	33	'Hail to the pressing-stones!'--the pressing-stones being the vital airs, it is the vital airs he thus bestows upon him. Having offered (with the second stick) he leans it against the middle enclosing-stick.
2	2	34	'Hail to the sounding-holes !'--thesounding-holes (pratirava), doubtless, are the vital airs, for everything here is pleased (pratirata) with the vital airs: it is the vital airs he thus bestows upon him. Having offered (with the third stick) he leans it against the middle enclosing-stick.
2	2	35	'Hail to the Fathers, (seated) upon the Barhis , and drinking the Gharma!'--even without offering he secretes (this, the fourth stick) under the barhis of the south part (of the vedi ) whilst looking towards the north . When the sacrifice had its head cut off, its life-sap flowed away, and went to the Fathers--the Fathers being three in number: it is them he thus pleases. Andas to why he does not look at it,--once for all the Fathers have passed away.
2	2	36	'Hail to Heaven and Earth!'--heaven and earth being the out (and in)-breathing and the up-breathing, it is the out and up-breathing he thus bestows upon him. Having offered (with the fifth stick) he leans it against the middle enclosing-stick.
2	2	37	'Hail to the All-gods!'--the Visve Devâh being the vital airs, it is the vital airs he thus bestows upon him. Having offered (with the sixth stick) he leans it against the middle enclosing-stick.
2	2	38	'Hail to Rudra, praised by the Rudras !'--even without offering (with this, the seventh stick), he, looking southwards, hands it to the Pratiprasthâtri, and the latter throws it outside (the offering-ground) northwards to the north of the hall, for this is the region of that god: he thus gratifies him in his own region. And as to why he does not look at it, he does so thinking, 'Lest Rudra should do me harm.'
2	2	39	There are seven of these oblations, for seven in number are these (channels of the) vital airs in the head: it is these he thus bestows upon him.
2	2	40	He then pours (the remaining milk and ghee) from the Mahâvîra into the supporting-tray with, 'Hail, light with light!'--for light indeed the milk was in the one (vessel), and light it is in the other, and these two lights thus unite with each other. The call of 'hail!' he places first, and the deity last: the mystic import of this is the same as before.
2	2	41	He then offers (the second of) the two Rauhina  (cakes) with, 'May the day be pleased with its brightness, the well-lighted with its light, hail!'--the mystic import of this is the same as before;--'may the night be pleased with its brightness, the well-lighted with its light, hail!'--the mystic import of this is the same as before.
2	2	42	He then hands to the Sacrificer the remainder of the Gharma. He, having solicited an invitation  (to the meal), drinks it with, 'Offered is the honey unto Agni, the greatest of Indras,'--'Offered is the honey unto Agni, the most powerful,' he thereby means to say; 'let us eat of thee, god Gharma: reverence be unto thee, injure us not!'--a blessing he thereby invokes.
2	2	43	Now, on the south side sand has been strewn; there they cleanse themselves : in this there is thesame significance as in the Mârgâlîya. The pieces of wood he throws into the fire. They then proceed with the Upasad. And thus the head of the sacrifice has been set right in the very same manner in which the Asvins then restored it.
2	2	44	One must not perform the Pravargya at one's first Soma-sacrifice, since that would be sinful, and lest Indra should cut off his head; but at the second or the third (Soma-sacrifice); for at first the gods went on worshipping and toiling with the headless sacrifice, therefore (he should do so) at the second or the third (sacrifice). Moreover, it will become heated and ablaze;--
2	2	45	And were he to perform the Pravargya at the first Soma-sacrifice, that (Mahâvîra) of his, when heated and ablaze, would burn up his family and cattle, and also his life, and the Sacrificer would be liable to perish: therefore (let him perform it) at the second or third (sacrifice).
2	2	46	Let him not perform the Pravargya for any and every one, lest he should do everything for every one, for the Pravargya is everything; but let him only perform it for him who is known, or to whoever may be dear to him, or who has studied sacred writ: by means of the study of sacred writ he would thus gain it.
2	2	47	One may perform the Pravargya for a thousand (head of cattle) , for a thousand means everything, and that (Pravargya) is everything. One mayperform it for all (the Sacrificer's) property; for all one's property means everything, and this (Pravargya) is everything. One may perform it at a Visvagit with all the Prishthas ; for the Visvagit (all-conquering day) with all the Prishthas means everything, and this (Pravargya) is everything One may perform it at the Vâgapeya (and) Râgasûya, for such (a ceremony) means everything. One may perform it at a sacrificial session, for the session means everything, and this (Pravargya) is everything. These are (the occasions for) his performances of the Pravargya, and (let him perform it) nowhere else but at these.
2	2	48	Here now they say, 'Seeing that the Pravargya is headless, whereby, then, does the Agnihotra become possessed of a head for him?' Let him say, 'By the Âhavanîya.'--'How the New and Full-moon sacrifices?' Let him say, 'By the ghee and the cake.'--'How the Seasonal sacrifices?' Let him say, 'By the oblation of clotted curds .'--'How the animal sacrifice?' Let him say, 'By the victim and the cake.'--'How the Soma-sacrifice?' Let him say, 'By the Havirdhâna .'
2	2	49	And they also say,--when the sacrifice had its head cut off, the gods on that occasion restored it as the hospitable reception  (of King Soma), and verily for him who so knows this offering is not made with any headless sacrifice whatever.
2	2	50	And, again, they say, 'Seeing that at the sacrifice they lead forward the Pranîtâ  (water), wherefore do they not lead it forward on this occasion?' Well, this--to wit, the Pranîtâ (water)--being the head of the sacrifice, and the Pravargya also being its head, (he does so) thinking, 'Lest I cause the head to be overtopped by a head.'
2	2	51	And, again, they say, 'Seeing that elsewhere there are fore-offerings and after-offerings, wherefore are there not any on this occasion?' Well, the fore-offerings and after-offerings being the vital airs, and so also the Avakâsas , and the pieces of wood, (it is so) lest he should cause the vital airs to be overtopped by vital airs.
2	2	52	And, again, they say, 'Seeing that elsewhere they offer two butter-portions, wherefore does he not offer them on this occasion?' Well, those two--to wit, the butter-portions--being the eyes of the sacrifice, and so also the two Rauhina (cakes)--(it is so) lest he should overtop eye by eye.
2	2	53	And, again, they say, 'Seeing that they make offering to the gods by means of wooden (vessels), wherefore does he offer this (Gharma) by means of one made of clay?' When the Sacrifice had its head cut off, its life-sap flowed away and entered the heaven and the earth. Now this (earth) is clay, and yonder (sky) is water; and the Mahâvîra (vessels) are made of clay and water: thus he supplies and completes it (the Pravargya) with that life-sap.
2	2	54	But if it were made of wood, it would beburnt; and if of gold, it would dissolve; and if of copper, it would melt; and if of stone, it would burn the two handling-sticks; and that (Gharma) itself submitted to that (earthen vessel): therefore it is by means of an earthen one that he offers it.
2	2	55	And, verily, whosoever either, teaches, or partakes of, this (Pravargya) enters that life, and that light: the observance thereof is the same as at the creation .
3	1	1	Now, on the third, or the sixth, or the twelfth day , having combined (the two performances of) the Pravargya and Upasads , he 'sets out ' the Pravargya, for set out (removed), as it were, is this head (from the trunk). Having gathered together all around it  (the Mahâvîra pot), theymeet together upon the Vedi in the Sâlâ, (entering) by the front door.
3	1	2	The Âgnîdhra then brings three bundles of faggots to the Âhavanîya, and kindling one of them, he offers (thereon) whilst holding it  on a level with (the Sacrificer's) mouth. When the sacrifice had its head cut off its heat went out of it, and entered these worlds: it is with that heat he thus supplies and completes it.
3	1	3	And as to why (it is held) on a level with the mouth,--well, what is level with the mouth is, as it were, above; and above, as it were, is yonder (heavenly) world: thus he thereby supplies and completes it (the Pravargya) with that heat which had entered yonder world.
3	1	4	'What heavenly fire of thine there is, O Gharma,'--just the fire which is heavenly;--'what is in the Gâyatrî and in the Havirdhâna,'--just that which is in the Gâyatrî (metre) and Havirdhâna (shed);--'may that (fire) of thine increase and become firm: to that (fire) of thine, hail!' in this there is nothing hidden, so to speak.
3	1	5	Then, having kindled the second (bundle), he offers (thereon) whilst holding it navel-high; for in the middle, as it were, is what is navel-high, and in the middle, as it were, is the air-world: thus he thereby supplies and completes it with that heat which had entered the air-world.
3	1	6	'What fire of thine is in the air,'--just the fire which is in the air;--'what is in the Trishtubh and in the Âgnîdhra,' just that which is in the Trishtubh (metre) and Âgnîdhra (fire-shed);--'may that (fire) of thine increase and become firm: to that (fire) of thine, hail!' in this there is nothing hidden, so to speak.
3	1	7	Then, having put the third (bundle) on the fire, he offers on it whilst sitting; for below, as it were, is he who is sitting; and below, as it were, is this (terrestrial) world: thus the thereby supplies and completes it with that heat which had entered this (terrestrial) world.
3	1	8	'What fire of thine is in the earth,'--just that fire which is in the earth;--'what is in the Gagatî and in the Sadas,' just that which is in the Gagatî (metre) and the Sadas (shed);--'may that (fire) of thine increase and become firm: to that (fire) of thine, hail!' in this there is nothing hidden, so to speak.
3	1	9	He (the Adhvaryu) then steps out , with , 'Thee (we will follow) for the protection of the Kshatra,'--for he who shines yonder  is indeed the divine ruler: 'for the protection of this human ruler,' he thereby means to say;--'guard thou the Brahman's body!'--that is to say, 'preserve thou the Brahman's person (âtman);'--'Thee (we will follow) as a stay for the Vis,'--the Vis (people, clan) doubtless is the sacrifice: 'for the safety of the sacrifice,' he thus means to say;--'we will follow to new prosperity,'--it is for the safety and the stability of the sacrifice that the says this.
3	1	10	He then says (to the Prastotri), 'Sing the Sâman!' or 'Recite the Sâman!' but let him rather say, 'Sing the Sâman!' for they indeed sing the Sâman. When he sings the Sâman it is in order that the fiends, the Rakshas, should not injure theseoutside the sacrifice, the body; for the Sâman is a repeller of the fiends, the Rakshas.
3	1	11	He sings it on a (verse) relating to Agni, for Agni is the repeller of the Rakshas. On an Atikkhandas (verse) he sings it, for that--to wit, the Atikkhandas (redundant metre) is all metres, therefore he sings it on an Atikkhandas (verse).
3	1	12	He sings , 'Agni burneth, encountereth with flames, Ahâvo! Ahâvo !'--it is thus he repels the fiends, the Rakshas, from here.
3	1	13	They walk out (from the sacrificial ground) northwards , along the back of the pit and the front side of the Âgnîdhra (fire-house)--for this is the gate of the sacrifice--and proceed in whatever direction from there water is (to be found).
3	1	14	Let him 'set out' that (Pravargya) on an island; for, when heated, it becomes burning-hot ; and were he to set it out on this (earth), its heat would enter this (earth); and were he to set it out on water, its heat would enter the water; but when he sets it out on an island--thus, indeed, it does not injure either the water or this (earth), for inasmuch as he does not throw it into the water, it does not injure the water; and inasmuch as the water flows all round it--water being a meansof soothing--it does not injure this (earth): let him therefore set it out on an island.
3	1	15	But let him rather set it out on the Uttaravedi ; for the Uttara-vedi is the sacrifice, and the Pravargya is its head: he thus restores to the sacrifice its head.
3	1	16	The first Pravargya (pot) he sets out so as to be close to (the front side of) the navel (of the Uttara-vedi), for the northern (upper) navel is the voice, and the Pravargya is the head: he thus places the voice in the head.
3	1	17	'The four-cornered,'--four-cornered, indeed, is he who shines yonder, for the quarters are his corners: therefore he says, 'Four-cornered';--
3	1	18	--'Mighty navel of the divine order,'--the divine order being the truth, he thereby means to say, 'The mighty navel of the truth;'--'that mighty one (be) unto us of all life;'--'that mighty one (be) unto us (a bestower) of the complete (term of) life,' he thereby means to say ;
3	1	19	--'from the hatred, from the guile,'--in this there is nothing hidden, so to speak;--'of him of another law, let us free ourselves!'--another law, indeed, is his (Pravargya's and the Sun's), and another that of men : therefore he says, 'Of him of another law, let us free ourselves.' In this way the other two (pots are placed) east of it: this is threefold, for the head is threefold .
3	1	20	In front thereof (he places) the reserve (lump of) clay, whereby he puts flesh upon it (Pravargya); on the two sides thereof the two lifting-sticks, whereby he gives two arms to it; and on the two sides yet further away the two Rauhina offering-ladles, whereby he gives two hands to it.
3	1	21	On the left (north) side (he places) the spade, for there is its place of rest; on the right (right) side the imperial throne, for there is its place of rest; on the left side the black antelope-skin, for there is its place of rest; on all sides (save the front side) the fans, for, the fans being the vital airs, he thereby bestows vital airs on it; there are three of them, for there are three vital airs, the out- (and in-) breathing, the up-breathing, and the through-breathing: it is these he thus bestows on him.
3	1	22	He then puts the cords and halter on the supporting-tray, and places (the latter) behind (thenavel) with its point towards the east: a belly he thus gives to it. On the two sides thereof the two milking-bowls (pinvana): two testicles he thereby gives to it, for by means of his testicles the male overflows (pinv). Behind (them he places) the post and peg: whereby he gives two thighs to it; behind (them) the two Rauhina-plates, whereby he gives two knees to it; and as to their being single plates, it is because these knees consist, as it were, of single plates (bones). Behind (them) the two poking-sticks (dhrishti), whereby he gives two feet to it, for with the feet one strikes out boldly (dhrishtam). On the left side the two mounds  used in the performance,. for there is their place of rest; on the right side the Mârgâlîya , for there is its place of rest.
3	1	23	He then pours milk into that (chief pot), with , 'This, O Gharma, is the contents of thy bowels,'--the contents of the bowels being food, it is food he thus puts into it;--'Grow thou, and fill out thereby!'--in this there is nothing hidden, so to speak;--'and may we ourselves grow, and fill out!'--it is a blessing he thereby invokes.
3	1	24	Let him not pour in all (the milk), lest the food should turn away from the Sacrificer.--He leaves over half of it or more; and on that same afternoon he pours it to the fast-milk, and hands it to the Sacrificer: thereby he bestows food uponthe Sacrificer, and thus, indeed, food does not turn away from the Sacrificer,
3	1	25	He then sprinkles it (the Pravargya apparatus) with water: water being a means of appeasement, he thus appeases it; he sprinkles it all over: all over he thus appeases it; three times he sprinkles, for threefold is the sacrifice.
3	1	26	He then says (to the Prastotri), 'Sing the Vârshâhara Sâman!'--the fallow stallion  (vrishâ harih) doubtless is he who shines yonder, and the Pravargya also is that (sun): it is thus him he thereby pleases, and therefore he says, 'Sing the Vârshâhara Sâman !'
3	1	27	They then cleanse themselves at the pit. With , 'May the waters and plants be friendly unto us,' he takes water in his joined hands; for water is a thunderbolt: he thus makes a covenant with the thunderbolt;--and with, 'May they be unfriendly unto him who hateth us, and whom we hate!' let him sprinkle it in whatever direction he who is hateful to him may be, and he thereby overthrows him.
3	1	28	He (the Sacrificer) then steps out towards the north-east, with , 'From out of the gloom have we risen,'--gloom isevil: it is gloom, evil, he thus drives away;--'beholding the higher light,'--this (terrestrial) world is higher than the water: it is on this world he thus establishes himself;--'God Sûrya, with the gods, the highest light,'--Sûrya, the highest light, is the heavenly world: it is in the heavenly world he thus finally establishes himself. He walks along without looking back, and puts a log of wood on the Âhavanîya , with , 'A kindler thou art, fire thou art: lay thou fire into me!' it is a blessing he thereby invokes.
3	1	29	And at a continued pressing of Soma they also perform the Gharma of curds and whey (Dadhi-gharma),--for Soma is the sacrifice, and the Pravargya is its head: he thus restores to the sacrifice its head,--at the midday-pressing, for that--to wit, the midday-pressing--is Indra's special pressing: he thus pleases him in his own share;--when the Mâdhyandina-pavamâna has been chanted, for the Mâdhyandina-pavamâna is the breath: it is breath he thereby lays into him;--with the Agnihotra-ladle, for the Agnihotra is the mouth of sacrifices: he thus puts a mouth in the head.
3	1	30	On its being brought, he says, 'Hotâr, speak what thou hast to speak!' for the Hotri speaks on this occasion. Then, stepping up, he says, 'Cooked is the offering-food;' for cooked, indeed, it is. Having stepped across (behind the Âhavanîya), and called for the Sraushat, he says, 'Pronounce the offering-formula!' and offers on the Vashat being uttered. When the Vashat isrepeated, he brings the draught, and hands it to the Sacrificer.
3	1	31	Having solicited an invitation  (and received an answer from the priests), he drinks of it, with , 'May there be in me that great energy,'--a great energy, indeed, is he who shines yonder;--'in me the fitness, in me the intelligence,'--fitness and intelligence he thus secures to himself;--'the Gharma of triple fires shineth,'--for this Gharma of triple fires indeed shines;--'together with the shining light,'--for together with the shining light (the sun) it indeed is;--'together with the fire, the Brahman,'--for together with the fire, the Brahman, it indeed is,--, 'The seed of the milk hath been brought,'--for this is indeed the seed of the milk that has been brought;--'may we obtain the milking thereof year after year!'--it is a blessing he thereby invokes. They then cleanse themselves at the pit the significance of this is the same as before.
3	1	32	Now, then, as to the sacrificial gifts. The gold plate he gives to the Brahman; for the Brahman is seated, and gold is settled  glory: therefore he gives the gold plate to the Brahman.
3	1	33	And that cow which yielded the Gharma-milk he gives to the Adhvaryu; for scorched, as it were, is the Gharma, and the Adhvaryu comes forth (from the sacrificial ground) like something scorched : therefore he gives it to the Adhvaryu.
3	1	34	And that cow which yielded the Sacrificer'sfast-milk he gives to the Hotri; for the Hotri is the sacrifice, and the Sacrificer also is the sacrifice: therefore he gives it to the Hotri.
3	1	35	And that cow which yielded the fast-milk for the (Sacrificer's) wife he gives to the chanters, for it is they, the Udgâtris, that do, as it were, the wife's work on this occasion: therefore he gives it to the chanters.
3	1	36	And, verily, whosoever either teaches, or partakes of, this (Pravargya) enters that life, and that light: the observance thereof is the same as at the creation .
3	2	1	Now this--to wit, the sacrifice--is the self of all beings, and of all gods: after its successful consummation the Sacrificer prospers in offspring (or, people) and cattle; but he whose Gharma (pot) is shattered is deprived of his offspring and cattle. In that case there is an expiation.
3	2	2	He offers an oblation of a full (spoon of ghee); for the full means everything: with everything he thus heals whatever has been unsuccessful in the sacrifice.
3	2	3	'Hail to the vital airs with their over-lord!'--the over-lord of the vital airs, doubtless, is the mind (soul), for in the mind all the vital airs are established: it is thus by means of the mind that he thereby heals whatever has been unsuccessful in the sacrifice.
3	2	4	'To the Earth hail!'--the earth, doubtless, is a place of abode for all the gods: it is thus by means of all the deities that he heals whatever has been unsuccessful in the sacrifice.
3	2	5	'To Agni hail!'--Agni, doubtless, is the self of all the gods: it is thus by means of all the deities that he heals whatever has been unsuccessful in the sacrifice.
3	2	6	'To the Air hail!'--the air, doubtless, is a place of abode for all the gods: it is thus by means of all the deities that he heals whatever has been unsuccessful in the sacrifice.
3	2	7	'To Vâyu hail!'--Vâyu (the wind), doubtless, is the self of all the gods: it is thus by means of all the deities that he heals whatever has been unsuccessful in the sacrifice.
3	2	8	'To the Sky hail!'--the sky, doubtless, is a place of abode for all the gods: it is thus by means of all the deities that he heals whatever has been unsuccessful in the sacrifice.
3	2	9	'To Sûrya hail!'--Sûrya (the sun), doubtless, is the self of all the gods: it is thus by means of all the deities that he heals whatever has been unsuccessful in the sacrifice.
3	2	10	'To the Regions hail!'--the regions, doubtless, are a place of abode for all the gods: it is thus by means of all the deities that he heals whatever has been unsuccessful in the sacrifice.
3	2	11	'To Kandra hail!'--Kandra (the moon), doubtless, is the self of all the gods: it is thus by means of all the deities that he heals whatever has been unsuccessful in the sacrifice.
3	2	12	'To the Nakshatras hail!'--the Nakshatras (lunar asterisms), doubtless, are a place of abode for all the gods: it is thus by means of all the deities that he heals whatever has been unsuccessful in the sacrifice.
3	2	13	'To the Waters hail!'--the waters, doubtless, are a place of abode for all the gods: it is thus by means of all the deities that he heals whatever has been unsuccessful in the sacrifice.
3	2	14	'To Varuna hail!'--Varuna, doubtless, is the self of all the gods: it is thus by means of all the deities that he heals whatever has been unsuccessful in the sacrifice.
3	2	15	'To the Navel hail! To the Purified one  hail!'--This is undefined, for undefined is Pragâpati, and Pragâpati is the sacrifice: it is thus Pragâpati, the sacrifice, he thereby heals.
3	2	16	These are thirteen oblations,--for there are thirteen months in the year, and the year is Pragâpati, and Pragâpati is the sacrifice: it is thus Pragâpati, the sacrifice, he thereby heals.
3	2	17	'To the Voice hail!'--a mouth he thereby gives to it;--'to the Breath hail! to the Breath hail!'--two nostrils (a nose) he thereby gives to it;--'to the Eye hail! to the Eye hail!'--two eyes he thereby gives to it;--'to the Ear hail! to the Ear hail!'--two ears he thereby gives to it.
3	2	18	These are seven oblations,--now seven in number are these vital airs in the head: it is them he thereby gives to it. He offers a last oblation of a full (spoon),--the full means everything:with everything he thus heals whatever has been unsuccessful in the sacrifice,--
3	2	19	With , 'The mind's purpose,'--by the mind, indeed, everything is gained here: by the mind he thus heals whatever has been unsuccessful in the sacrifice;--
3	2	20	'The truth of speech may I freely obtain,'--by speech everything is gained here: by speech he thus heals whatever has been unsuccessful in the sacrifice;--'may the form of cattle, the essence of food, fame, and prosperity accrue unto me, hail!'--a blessing he thereby invokes.
3	2	21	Thereupon, having pounded that spare (clay), and mixed it with powdered clay, he makes (a pot) in proper form, and bakes it in proper form for the purpose of the 'setting out'; and let him perform (the sacrifice) with whichever of the two reserve (pots) may be firm.
3	2	22	The Pravargya, indeed, is the year; for the year is everything, and the Pravargya is everything: when it is placed on the fire then it is spring; when it is burning-hot then it is summer; when it is flowing over then it is the rainy season;--but, indeed, when the rains overflow, all the gods and all beings subsist thereon; and, verily, the rains overflow for him who thus knows this.
3	2	23	The Pravargya, indeed, is these worlds, for these worlds are everything, and the Pravargya is everything: when it is placed on the fire then it is this (terrestrial) world; when it is burning-hot then it is the air-world; and when it flows over then it is yonder (heavenly) world;--but,indeed; when yonder world overflows, all the gods and all beings subsist thereon; and, verily, yonder world overflows for him who thus knows this.
3	2	24	The Pravargya, indeed, is those deities--Agni, Vâyu, and Âditya; for those deities are everything, and the Pravargya is everything: when it is placed on the fire then it is Agni; when it is burning-hot then it is Vâyu (the wind); and when it flows over then it is Âditya (the sun);--but, indeed, when yonder sun overflows, all the gods and all beings subsist upon him; and, verily, yonder sun overflows for him who thus knows this.
3	2	25	The Pravargya, indeed, is the Sacrificer, his own self, his offspring (or people) and cattle; for the Sacrificer is everything, and the Pravargya is everything when it is placed on the fire then it is his own self; when it is burning-hot then it is his offspring; and when it flows over then it is his cattle;--but, indeed, when the cattle overflow (with milk) all the gods and all beings subsist thereon; and, verily, the cattle overflow for him who thus knows this.
3	2	26	The Pravargya, indeed, is the Agnihotra, for the Agnihotra is everything, and the Pravargya is everything: when it (the Agnihotra milk) is put on the fire then it is the (Gharma) placed thereon; when it is ladled out then it is the burning-hot (Gharma); and when it is offered then it is the overflowing (Gharma);--but, indeed, when the Agnihotra overflows all the gods and all beings subsist thereon; and, verily, the Agnihotra overflows for him who thus knows this.
3	2	27	The Pravargya, indeed, is the New and Full-moon sacrifices; for the New and Full-moon sacrificesare everything, and the Pravargya is everything: when it (the havis) is put on the fire then it is the (Gharma) placed thereon; when it is standing ready then it is the burning-hot (Gharma); and when it is offered then it is the overflowing (Gharma); but, indeed, when the New and Full-moon sacrifices overflow all the gods and all beings subsist thereon; and, verily, the New and Full-moon sacrifices overflow for him who thus knows this.
3	2	28	The Pravargya, indeed, is the Seasonal sacrifices, for the Seasonal sacrifices are everything, and the Pravargya is everything: when it (the havis) is put on the fire then it is the (Gharma) placed thereon; when it is standing ready then it is the burning-hot (Gharma); and when it is offered then it is the overflowing (Gharma);--but, indeed, when the Seasonal sacrifices overflow then all the gods and all beings subsist thereon; and, verily, the Seasonal sacrifices overflow for him who thus knows this.
3	2	29	The Pravargya, indeed, is the Animal sacrifice, for the Animal sacrifice is everything, and the Pravargya is everything: when it (the meat) is put on the fire then it is the (Gharma) placed thereon; and when it is standing ready then it is the burning-hot (Gharma); and when it is offered then it is the overflowing (Gharma);--but, indeed, when the animal offering overflows all the gods and all beings subsist thereon; and, verily, the animal offering overflows for him who thus knows this.
3	2	30	The Pravargya, indeed, is Soma, for Soma is everything, and the Pravargya is everything: when it is poured out then it is the (Gharma) placed on the fire; when it is drawn (into thecups) then it is the burning-hot (Gharma); and when it is offered then it is the overflowing (Gharma);--but, indeed, when Soma overflows all the gods and all beings avail themselves thereof; and, verily, Soma overflows for him who thus knows this; and, verily, no sacrifice whatever is offered without the Pravargya for him who thus knows this.
3	2	31	And, verily, whosoever either teaches, or partakes of, this (Pravargya) enters that life, and that light: the observance of the rule thereof is the same as at the creation .
